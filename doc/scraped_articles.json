Other actors in the ecosystems include local buying agents, processors, exporters, and service providers.\n\n\u201cThe challenges around the production and processing of cashew in Nigeria mainly centre around the primary production of cashew from aged trees .

The House of Assembly has been operating their own autonomy since two years even before they started talking about it in this country.\n\n\u201cIt has worked; I have not found any reason to regret that action. So, I believe too that there is no reason why the judiciary cannot run its own autonomy.\n\n\u201cI do also believe that it does not stop the arms of government from relating with each other.\n\n\u201cThe budgets are made on a yearly basis and the only challenge is that many times we are unable to fund it in full. However, what will be released on a monthly basis will be subject to the returns that come from Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC),\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that with the commencement of the full process, the Chief Judge had been empowered to effect his own direct approvals without having to resort to the governor.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to do that because it reduces the number of files on my table. So, I want to announce the full autonomy of the judiciary with the setting up of the committees.\n\n\u201cI am not doing this for any gains. I believe that it\u2019s right and just; I believe too that it\u2019s in the best interest of governance in our nation and that\u2019s how we have also thought about it in the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cI want to generally advise that autonomy does not stop governance from progressing; in fact, it helps governance and I believe that it is something worth doing,\u2019\u2019 Okowa stated\n\nHe thanked judges in the state for their role in ensuring delivery of justice.\n\n\u201cSo my Lord, the Chief Judge, I want to congratulate you for setting up the committee.\n\n\u201cApart from the files that are expected to come to my office, I will advise that no further files should be sent because you are now expected to approve your files by yourself because that\u2019s the process of the autonomy.\n\n\u201cWe thank God that whatever that has a beginning has an end, and I am glad that you have worked so hard to improve on the judicial process in the state.\n\n\u201cI truly appreciate your service to the state and the relationship you kept with the executive arm of government and my family. It was God who made it possible for you to conduct my inauguration in 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary in Delta has continued to walk tall and what I hear happening in other states, I never witnessed it here.\n\n\u201cI have never had cause to worry here and I must thank the Chief Judge and all his brother judges for their cooperation.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer and hope that God will continue to be with you in the course of your retirement,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nEarlier, Justice Umukoro had said that he led the judges to visit the governor as part of the valedictory activities leading to his disengagement as a judicial officer and head of the judicial arm of government in Delta.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to Governor Okowa for his support to him since he became the helmsman of the judiciary in 2015.\n\n\u201cSince I came on board six years ago, you treated me as a brother and I am grateful for your support even during the death of my wife.\n\n\u201cAs Chief Judge of Delta, I can confidently say that we have never had any crisis and we have been able to manage ourselves effectively.\n\n\u201cI am here to deeply appreciate you for supporting me throughout my tenure as Chief Judge of the State and to also thank you for approving the process for the implementation of full autonomy for the state judiciary,\u201d he stated.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna\n\nKaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has declared Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) leaders who coordinated the shutdown of the state in protest over mass sack of workers as bandits.\n\nHe vowed they will be prosecuted, accusing them of unwanton destruction of public properties and disruption of peace.\n\nTheir actions, according to the Governor, were equivalent to the actions of bandits terrorising the state.\n\nHe also ordered the sack of all nurses in the state below Grade Level 14 and lecturers of the Kaduna State University (KASU) for joining the five-day warning strike.\n\nThe Governor, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye, lamented some nurses joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of its health facilities.\n\nHe alleged the nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\nThe Governor declared the state will prosecute three nurses of Barau Teaching Hospital, who allegedly disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, according to him, has been directed to advertise vacancies for immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed.\n\nThe Governor also said any academic staff of Kaduna State University (KASU) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\nThe statement titled: \u201cKDSG will not tolerate criminal acts disguised as industrial action\u201d reads: \u201cToday, the Kaduna State Government reviewed the sundry criminal actions that have defined the campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness waged by the NLC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cKDSG considers as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days.\n\n\u201cHowever, KDSG cannot be expected to tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients, unlawful trespass into public facilities and the wanton use of coercion and restraints of personal freedom by the NLC.\n\n\u201cEfforts to dress up criminal activity as industrial action do not change the reality of the law breaking that has unfolded, including their persistently ignoring the prohibition against impeding essential services.\n\n\u201cAlso, KDSG cannot ignore the illegal pressures brought to disrupt the operations of banks and other private business whose staff and customers do not have any industrial dispute with the state or any other government.\n\n\u201cKDSG acknowledges doctors and some other categories of health workers that are trying to run public health facilities but regrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities. Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\n\u201cReports from Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disclosed that some identified nurses disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday, 17th May 2021. The names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby.\n\n\u201cIn addition, KDSG has decided the following: Ayuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC are declared wanted and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts. They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements;\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike. Salaries that could have gone to them are to be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed;\n\n\u201cAny academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed. The authorities of KASU are to submit a copy of the attendance register for all categories of staff daily to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education;\n\n\u201cAll MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service;\n\n\u201cKDSG views the actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens. Bandits illegally use arms but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends: trying to hold hostage the freedoms, economic interests, livelihoods and resources of the people of Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cIt is a vain expectation that this government will respond differently to sets of unlawful actions that have the same ends.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not submit its treasury to the entitled minority. We will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna State even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum.\n\n\u201cThe government remains committed to using all the resources it can generate to serve the interests of the majority of its citizens, providing social services beyond paying salaries, always putting the interests of the many ahead of the few.\u201d",
          "summary": "Their actions, according to the Governor, were equivalent to the actions of bandits terrorising the state.\nHe also ordered the sack of all nurses in the state below Grade Level 14 and lecturers of the Kaduna State University (KASU) for joining the five-day warning strike.\nThe Governor also said any academic staff of Kaduna State University (KASU) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\u201cIt is a vain expectation that this government will respond differently to sets of unlawful actions that have the same ends.\nWe will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna State even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum.",

How can many of us cope with these terrible situations?\n\n\u201cMany of us are widows, in fact, we are really suffering. They promised that things will change, but we are not seeing the signal.\n\n\u201cAll we are getting are promises upon promises. It is time for us to get what is commensurate to our efforts in terms of payment,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso lending her voice, Mrs. Nike Alatise, revealed they started the street sweeping job in 2003 with N2, 500 monthly salary before it was increased to N5, 000.\n\n\u201cOur job is tedious and things are difficult for us. To survive is not easy and what we want is a sum of N30,000 monthly stipend that is in tandem with the N30,000 minimum wage already signed into law in Ekiti\u201d, she posited.\n\nBut Commissioner for Environment Barr. Iyabo Fakunle Okiemen said all the demands of the protesting workers have been taken to Governor Fayemi.",

The world\u2019s spotlight will be on Nigeria in 2023. It needs to be a better election, not perfect but better to consolidate and improve Nigeria\u2019s democracy, and I think the Governor very much agree with me on that.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner said her discussion with Wike revolved around the economy, prospects of his vision including youth employment and his challenges in tackling them.\n\nOn security, she said Britain was helping the Nigerian military to build its combat capacity in tackling insurgency, including Boko Haram in the northern part of Nigeria.\n\nShe said the British military had its presence in Nigeria for many years and had continued to offer training on how to counter insurgency in the northern part of Nigeria.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn the North in particular, we are sharing our experiences in counter-insurgency from Northern Ireland, from Iraq and from Afghanistan. We have a military presence here. It has been here for many years training your military in counter-insurgency and also sharing our experiences.\n\n\u201cThat this kind of challenges are not solved by the military means alone, ultimately it\u2019s about rebuilding trust with the people of this country and having a good offer as well as tackling the underline economic drive, unemployment.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLaing said the British government was offering economic assistance to Nigeria because of the realisation that lack of economic opportunities in the north had made youths in that region to become easy recruits of Boko Haram.\n\nShe said: \u201cUnemployment, many young men out of work are very easy to target for Boko Haram. So we are sharing our experience and in a practical sense helping on the security side and offering economic support to the country to enable that there will be more jobs for the people.\u201d",

This necessitated the amendment of Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) which the president signed in August 2020, paving way for the commencement of implementation of disclosure principles.\n\n\u201cThe Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020 has provisions dealing with disclosure of Persons with Significant Control (PSC) who have, at least, five per cent of voting equity holding or voting rights and who are ultimate beneficial owners of such registered entities to disclose such interest\u201d he said.\n\nIn his welcome address, Minister of Budget and National Planning, Clem Ikanade Agba, disclosed that the Global Support Unit of the Open Government Partnership through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund awarded a grant of $400,000 to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis grant is managed by the World Bank and we are at the final stages of documentation for the release of this grant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further noted that the OGP Multi-Donor Trust Fund, Open Government Partnership with the support of development partners and working together with World Bank, established the OGP Multi-Donor Trust Fund (or the MDTF) to support World Bank client countries and local entities that participate in OGP or intend to become eligible to participate in OGP.",

The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages. To this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\n\n\u201cThe meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\nThe meeting also thanked Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State \u201cfor being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South West Zone, to ensure that PDP takes over majority of the states in the Zone.\n\nApart from Makinde and Tambuwal, the PDP governors that were also in attendance are the vice chairman of the forum and Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu; Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Duoye For (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Godwin Onadeko (Edo), and Nyesom Wike (Rivers). Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State was represented by his deputy, Mahdi Mohd.\n\nMeanwhile, the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that it did not come to him as a surprise hearing the governors, under the umbrella of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), describing the APC-led government as rudderless and incompetent.\n\nIn a reaction to the communique the PDP governors issued after their meeting, in Ibadan, yesterday, the former Edo State governor said that having deployed the same format to remove them from office, they are just paying the APC in their own coins.",

That is an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act and we want him, we will bring him to justice.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for him, he should report to the nearest police station or report to us. He will be prosecuted for economic sabotage,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that there is no ground for any compromise with the NLC, insisting that the labour union has used its last ultimate weapon and he will not change his position.\n\n\u201cThere is no grounds for compromise. They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything. We will not change our position,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nReacting, the NLC President, Wabba, said he is waiting for the governor to arrest him. Speaking while while leading a peaceful procession by workers on Tuesday in Kaduna, Wabba said the issue is not about him but about workers, adding that: \u201cWe are here and waiting for him to come and arrest us. This is not about me, it is about Nigerian workers.\u201d\n\nThe state chapter of the NLC had on Monday commenced a five-day warning strike to protest against the sacking of thousands of workers by the state government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the PDP governors called on Buhari to immediately send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the constitution to devolve more powers to the states to enable governors to effectively manage security in their domains, especially through the establishment of a state policing system and developing their own internal security arrangements.\n\nThey said: \u201cIn the interim, Mr. President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr. President and all state governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that the police force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and recently by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to states; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the six-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors enjoined all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and other cleavages.\n\nTambuwal said the meeting called on the \u201cincompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\nHe added that the meeting reiterated the earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\n\nThe PDP governors thanked their host and colleague in Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmarks developmental projects he has executed.\n\nThey urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South-west to ensure that PDP takes over the majority of the states in the zone.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were Tambuwal; Governors Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State; Douye Diri of Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Seyi Makinde Oyo State; Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State; Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Mohammed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Acumen\u2019s patient capital is providing investment alternatives for companies tackling poverty",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nIn 2017, Sanmi Lajuwomi identified a problem with the solar leasing space in Nigeria.\n\nOptimistic that it was worth further investigation, he pooled his personal funds and that of a high-net-worth individual in the UK, and undertook a two-year pilot study. At the end of the study, he had a better understanding of the customers and the challenges of running a business in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria in 2019.\n\nLajuwomi\u2019s company Winnock began by leasing solar equipment which could save small businesses up to 70% on electricity costs. The company has since added other productive use equipment such as sewing machines, fridges and freezers.\n\nIn 2019, they raised funds from some investors and got connected to Acumen. Impressed by what they saw, Acumen started a conversation with them.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty for the young startup of 10 people. Surprisingly, Lajuwomi got a call from Acumen, they hadn\u2019t concluded the due diligence process but in the light of recent happenings, they made him an offer of a $50,000 grant or convertible debt.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the loan was disbursed and Winnock was able to retain 100% of its staff without a salary reduction. Later in the year, Acumen invested in Winnock.\n\nAcumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. Its first appearance in Africa was in 2006 when its Kenyan office was set up, while its Lagos office was later created in 2012.\n\nOver the years, it has invested across West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and East African countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Collectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\n\nMy first contact with Acumen was through their Acumen Academy online courses. In July 2018, I took their Storytelling for Change course. For a long time, I had thought Acumen was an education company, and that was the starting point of my conversation with Meghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Why these courses?\n\nMeghan Curran: We started with a physical leadership development program, our West Africa fellows program. From that program, we started to think about how we could teach some of those skills to a broader audience so that people working on social change problems anywhere, could access these different pieces of content that would strengthen their work.\n\nThat\u2019s how the online courses came about. We started the online courses in 2012/2013 and to date have had more than 500,000 people participate in courses around the world in over 193 countries. The curriculum has expanded to include more courses asides leadership. The objective of these courses is to just help social entrepreneurs we may end up eventually investing in someday or generally help build other entrepreneurs who want to build their own skills.\n\nDA: Now that we\u2019re clear Acumen is not just an education company, What does Acumen do?\n\nMC: The original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. The best of both of those worlds is what we now call the patient capital approach. What that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\n\nOnce we make that investment, we\u2019re often doing equity deals and holding our position in a company for a number of years. When we exit our stake in the company that capital is returned to us. In a typical investment fund that returned capital would go back to the investors who had put money in and they would earn their returns.\n\nIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen and we redeploy it and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\n\nThe second thing that\u2019s really important is that we also have flexibility in terms of returns. Most investment funds have a specific return target that they\u2019re committed to achieving, because we\u2019re not returning capital to our investors, we\u2019re just trying to recover exactly what we put in. We have somewhat moderated return expectations, and this enables our entrepreneurs to really stay focused on the social objectives that they\u2019re trying to achieve without being forced, either to do something like pursue growth at all costs, and to hit exponential scale overnight.\n\nDA: How do you pick the companies you invest in?\n\nMC: Over the last couple of years in West Africa, we\u2019ve been focused primarily on renewable energy and agriculture. In both instances, we\u2019re looking for companies that have been operational anywhere from two to five years and have demonstrated a track record and revenue growth.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be profitable at the time we invest. In fact, most of them are not. There has to be a path to profitability where we can see where the break-even point is and where they will become profitable. I would say the thing that\u2019s consistent across any of the companies we look at is really wanting to get to know the entrepreneur. The assessment of the entrepreneur or the founding team is on two or three different levels. The first is values alignment. We\u2019re not trying to impose Acumen\u2019s mission or social objectives on an entrepreneur. We want to find entrepreneurs who, independent of Acumen, are interested in creating the same type of impact we want to see. Obviously, a significant percentage of their customer base has to be individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nThe second piece is the operational and technical capacity of the entrepreneur or the founding team. This means that they have done their homework on the industry or the sector that they\u2019re working in. It\u2019s sometimes reflected in the strength of the team that they have around them.\n\nDA: What are the sectors you\u2019re focused on?\n\nMC: The last couple of years we\u2019ve been really focused on renewable energy and agriculture. We\u2019re really starting to shift our impact definition to be inclusive of other sectors or business models.\n\nWe are asking ourselves how we look at transportation, waste management or light manufacturing, sectors that are often employing large numbers of low-income individuals and where they can make adjustments to their business models, to ensure that the jobs they\u2019re providing pay a living wage or create some kind of social safety net.\n\nDA: In your world of patient capital, How long does it take to do due diligence?\n\nMC: It really depends on how prepared the company is when we meet them and where they are in their stage of development. For our due diligence, It\u2019s just really about understanding the business model, understanding what their growth projections are and what some of those underlying assumptions are. That can take a month or two. Our more formal diligence where we\u2019re out doing these other interviews, conducting site visits, talking to customers, suppliers, other investors that you may have. Also doing our own kind of market research and market landscaping to make sure things all add up.\n\nThat can take another month or two. Once we get the investment approved there\u2019s documentation and that\u2019s where the lawyers come in and we\u2019re negotiating the details of the terms. From when we first meet you to when we make the investment, I would say six to nine months.\n\nMeghan Curran of Acumen Fund visit to PIND Foundation, Warri Office\n\nDA: What does a typical investment from you look like?\n\nMC: We do anything from $200,000 to $500,000 as the first investment.\n\nI would say there\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned along the way. When we started out, we didn\u2019t expect that if we could help these companies achieve scale, that there would be a long line of other investors waiting to follow us, but that there would be an availability of secondary capital that would enable us to exit. What we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s challenging for a couple of reasons. The markets we operate in are still in some ways underdeveloped such that most investors that are coming in, want to see their cash go to grow the company, not to buy existing investors.\n\nThe second piece is that we find that some of our entrepreneurs actually really value having Acumen as a board member to help protect that social objective. They sometimes don\u2019t want us to leave even when there\u2019s an opportunity. This is challenging and in a good way, but still challenging. What we\u2019ve started to do, with some of our more recent investments to address this, is to experiment with different investment instruments that enable us to have a clearer path to liquidity. In a recent investment we did in Sierra Leone, we actually structured it as a self-liquidating equity instrument where I think after a six or seven year period, the company has the opportunity to buy back shares from Acumen. In this way, the ownership stake eventually stays with the entrepreneurs and with the company, we have a path to some capital recovery, and yet in the short term, it\u2019s equity financing, that gives them the freedom and wiggle room to do what they need to do in the short to medium term.\n\nIn general, we end up holding our investments anywhere between seven to ten, sometimes up to 12 years, but we are trying to be creative about how we structure those investments to reduce, or to shorten that time horizon.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other \u2018traditional\u2019 investors considering the fact that there\u2019s only so much an impact fund can do?\n\nMC: I think we really see ourselves as a feeder to some of those more traditional investors. In the version of the world where everything goes according to plan, we\u2019re investing in some of these companies still at a relatively early stage. We\u2019re often the first institutional investor that they\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re able to accompany them to hit a certain growth trajectory or a certain level of maturity and scale, that\u2019s when they then become more attractive to some of those more commercial or traditional investors. We really see ourselves as helping build that pipeline of investments. What we see in West Africa is that there is a decent number of equity investors that are looking for investments where they want to put in a million or $3 million. Some even start at $5 million and there aren\u2019t that many companies that can absorb that type of capital.\n\nDA: How do companies find you or you find companies you invest in?\n\nMC: It\u2019s definitely a mix. We participate in the startup ecosystem. We go to different business plan competitions or industry events. We\u2019ve partnered with a couple of other earlier-stage investors to try to get to know and develop the pipeline.\n\nThrough our fellowship program and through our online courses as well. What we\u2019re really focused on in this coming year is continuing to push our footprint beyond Lagos and Abuja. We really want to go out to some of the other cities in Nigeria and be able to generate and develop a pipeline that\u2019s beyond the usual suspects.\n\nA session at The East Africa Acumen fellows program\n\nDA: What is a notable investment for you?\n\nMC: d.light which we first invested in 2007. The founders of that company from the beginning were really keen on developing a product or a suite of products that will be affordable for low-income consumers. They didn\u2019t develop the first solar panel but what they did was take a $20/25 product and push it down to be a $5 product. From there came solar home systems and now we\u2019re getting into solar appliances and not that they were the only company, but they were definitely one of the first movers and one of the early companies to really see low-income communities as a market.\n\nWe ended up making five different investments in delight over a 10 year period. We\u2019ve now partially exited and the company I think has served 80 million customers around the world. Not all of them in Africa, but a significant concentration. That\u2019s definitely one of our success stories.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging. The response to that has been some of these more creative financing instruments, whether it\u2019s doing revenue-based financing or these other self-liquidating instruments.\n\nAnother trend, which I think is a little more unfortunate is that the impact investing landscape has become pretty crowded with impact investors that are looking for market-ratemarket rate returns. At that point, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish the impact funds from the commercial funds. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself because I do think there are business models that have fewer trade-offs between impact and returns.\n\nDA: See trends in terms of sectors?\n\nMC: All of a sudden everyone is doing something that\u2019s agritech. Although there\u2019s a lot an app can do, there\u2019s also a lot more, particularly when you\u2019re working with small farmers, that is always going to be offline.\n\nWe look at agritech companies and we\u2019re really trying to evaluate what are their tech capabilities, as well as their offline capabilities? In some instances, offline is the harder part of the work. I think entrepreneurs need to have an awareness that tech should enable your solution, but it can\u2019t always be \u2013 it won\u2019t always be \u2013 the full solution.\n\nDA: Which Acumen courses would you recommend?\n\nMC: I would say the adaptive leadership course. Adaptive leadership is a framework to help think through problems that are complex with no known solution. On the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data. I think a lot of social entrepreneurs know in their head what they\u2019re trying to do in terms of the impact that they want to see, but being able to quantify it is a challenge.",
          "summary": "Acumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives.\nCollectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\nWhat that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging.\nOn the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data.",

          "text": "In March, Nigerian startup Termii raised $1.4 million in a seed round. Future Africa co-led the round with Kepple Africa Ventures, a Japanese Africa-focused venture capital firm.\n\nIt is not clear how much Future Africa invested in Termii but the firm can invest up to $500,000 in deals, thanks to the Future Africa Collective, its community of angel investors.\n\nIt turns out Future Africa has done a dozen other deals since. Other investments this year have been in Kenyan startups Lami and Ongair, as well as in Stitch, a South African company building APIs for open banking.\n\nThe firm says it has invested $3 million in 13 startups in the first five months of 2021. By doing so, they have doubled their 2020 performance in dollar terms.\n\nFuture Africa invested $1.2 million in 14 startups in 2020. They returned $3.7 million to some of the firm\u2019s first limited partners after profitably exiting some legacy positions through secondaries.\n\nFuture Africa has now made 47 investments as a fund. Launched in 2020, the firm operates an institutional venture capital fund (\u201cFuture Africa Fund\u201d) and a subscription-based syndicate composed of Africa-focused angel investors (\u201cFuture Africa Collective\u201d).\n\nMembers of the Future Africa Collective pay $1,000 annually for the opportunity to invest a minimum of $5,000 per deal. Future Africa Fund alone invests a maximum of $50,000 per deal.\n\nOlabinjo Adeniran, a Future Africa co-founder, said members of the Future Africa Collective will have access to 20 deals in 2021. These 20 will be part of 100 startup investments that the Future Africa Fund plans to make this year.\n\nSeen in that light, it looks like Future Africa is behind schedule with 13 investments after four months. Adeniran confirms that not all 13 investments have been offered to members of the Collective, so the firm is also behind on the 20-startup target.\n\nBut \u201cwe think we are going to exceed the target number on both ends,\u201d Adeniran says to TechCabal.\n\nFuture Africa chose not to disclose the 9 other investments it has made because the startups have not announced the funding. But they did drop a few hints:\n\nTwo digital banks: one for financial organisations transacting between Africa and the UK; the other for African migrants.\n\n\u201cA pharmaceutical startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to solve the drug counterfeiting problem in Africa\u201d\n\nA startup that \u201chelps businesses create flexible virtual and physical cards for multiple purposes\u201d which might be Sudo (Adeniran declined to confirm or deny).\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s initial investments were centered around Nigerian startups like 54Gene, Bamboo and Eden, but the firm is taking a more pan-African outlook. Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are now represented on the firm\u2019s portfolio map.\n\nBeyond the appeal of building a pan-African suite of investments, Future Africa hopes to fund more women-led startups. At the beginning of the year, the firm set out to invest $1 million in women-led startups.\n\nIt appears Future Africa has met that milestone, though no details are provided about the women-led startups. We know Lami, one of the new investments, is co-founded and led by a woman \u2013 Jihan Abass.\n\nFuture Africa plans to fund more women-led startups, pushing past the initial $1 million goal.\n\n\u201cWe are going to announce some new structures soon that will enable us move even faster and invest in more startups,\u201d Adeniran says. \u201cIt should be ready within the next 3 months.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside Klasha\u2019s mission to help 5,000 global retailers sell and ship to Africa",
          "text": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the first week of May, the eve of Klasha\u2019s public launch. Jessica Anuna is showing me a demo of a customer adding items to a cart in an online store, filling in billing details and paying through Klasha.\n\nA few seconds later, her phone beeps with an email notification that her demo order has been placed, with a receipt attached for proof.\n\nAnuna exudes the relief and excitement of a founder and CEO who has built an e-commerce payments product from scratch after nearly three years. Klasha is her solution for global merchants looking to serve Africa\u2019s increasingly digitally native consumers.\n\n\u201cWith Klasha, merchants would not have to open individual country stores. They can now make their existing global e-commerce stores Africa friendly,\u201d Anuna says.\n\nThe business case\n\nOpening individual country stores is a secondary headache. For merchants who want to sell in Africa, the first problem is setting up country-by-country payment connections.\n\nTo do this well, these merchants have to be present on the ground and do some dreary work, like managing currency conversions themselves.\n\nKlasha Checkout essentially absorbs all of that responsibility into one payment gateway. Hear Anuna explain how Klasha manages exchange rate fluctuations:\n\n\u201cAt the time the customer pays for the item, the exchange rate is locked in. That way, we are able to remit the equivalent value to the merchant. In the merchant\u2019s dashboard, they can opt to pay themselves out at different exchange rates.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to payments, Klasha\u2019s e-commerce feature includes a logistics service. This service is built to convince high-growth brands, doing above $20 million in gross merchandise value, that Africa is a destination to take seriously.\n\nHer pitch is that when a merchant sets up a Klasha Checkout option on their website, Africans will more readily purchase items in their local currencies. Ghanaians pay with mobile money. Kenyans pay with M-Pesa. Nigerians can pay with Naira bank cards.\n\nBundling logistics and payments\n\nAt the moment, Anuna says they have retailers from the US, UK, the Middle East, and some conversations are ongoing with retailers in Japan. Their focus is on retailers selling fast-moving consumer goods that are not perishable \u2013 clothes, shoes, bags and electronics.\n\nKlasha will make revenue by taking commissions on sales and offering subscriptions to merchants, especially for add-ons like analytics. In exchange, the startup helps merchants collect payments from and ship directly to African buyers\u2019 doorsteps in no more than 9 working days.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous promise, especially the logistics aspect. Klasha is primarily a payments company. To fulfil deliveries, they will be partnering with two different logistics companies; the first brings the merchant\u2019s goods into Africa while the second delivers to the customer\u2019s door. In Nigeria, Anuna says they are ready to deliver to every local government area.\n\nWhy is a young startup burdening itself with this complexity, knowing how poor road infrastructure in Nigeria hampers efficient logistics?\n\nAlthough she held back details of Klasha\u2019s logistics, Anuna is confident that the company can deliver on a dependable model, which won\u2019t make consumers pay higher prices than other payments and shipping options.\n\nShe\u2019s relying on her experience at Amazon, Net-a-Porter and Shopify, plus four years in China running a logistics business.\n\nJessica Anuna, founder and CEO of Klasha. Image credit: Klasha\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t built Klasha alone. A glass wall separates the room where we meet from an adjacent room where her developers are having a chat, their laptops displaying several lines of code in pink and other colours.\n\nThe sales team, led by Fumi Aoki, is in another room crouched over computers. Aoki joined recently from Senri, a sales automation startup. Other members of the 11-person Klasha team have Nigerian startup experience from places like OPay, Andela and Boomplay.\n\nShooting for 5,000 Klasha merchants\n\nI wonder if Klasha can go on to integrate emerging fintech offerings \u2013 like Buy Now Pay Later. Anuna says her team has discussed it, but it is not on their short-term roadmap.\n\nAt the same time, she tries to sell me on the Klasha mobile app. The app enables users to generate virtual cards & shop on online stores regardless of whether the store has Klasha Checkout or not.\n\nKlasha\u2019s virtual card carries VISA\u2019s emblem and allows users to spend beyond the $100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The other distinct feature of the mobile app is sending money to peers using Twitter-like handles, which reminds me of Abeg, the peer-to-peer payments startup owned by Piggyvest.\n\nKlasha is in the virtual cards business. Goodbye $100 limits?\n\nAfter an hour-long conversation, I leave Anuna and her team to continue launch preparations. At least one influencer was drafted for publicity on D-Day; to drive app downloads.\n\nBut that will not be the metric to assess Klasha in three, six, or nine months. Instead, look out for how many major online stores and marketplaces Anuna has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have 5,000 merchants by Q1 2022,\u201d she says.\n\nHow many do they have right now? \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but we are on track.\u201d",

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users. Fundall\u2019s dollar virtual cards aims to eliminate the challenge of spending limits Nigerians come across when making international payments using naira cards. The USD-denominated debit card is a limitless passport to the world as users are able to enjoy freedom and flexibility when making payments in dollars anywhere in the world.\n\nWith a Fundall virtual dollar card, users can spend internationally and transact on any website seamlessly as well as enjoy the convenience, flexibility, safety, and security of cashless payments across various channels \u2013 whether for shopping online on Shopify or Amazon, paying for streaming access on Netflix, or business services like Facebook Ads.\n\nFundall users will be able to get their first virtual dollar card for free, while the creation fee for subsequent card creation is just $2. Users are also able to create multiple cards instantly and can easily dedicate each card to one web platform.\n\nFundall \u2013 run by a company of the same name founded in 2019 \u2013 is on a mission to provide all things money in one place to their customers. Fundall users can manage everything money-related on its online platform; and unlike most banking services providers that only focus on the money of their clients, Fundall does more to help its growing user base. There are currently 17,000 individuals and 150 businesses registered on Fundall\u2019s online platform right now.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foremost financial super app offers a wide range of services that include flexible payments and transfers, savings plans, in addition to advanced tools for better money management such as lifestyle cards, budget planning, income and spending analytics, SaveAsYou Spend, Portfolio Line of Credit, and insurance.

A savings tool and wealth builder aimed towards specific goals are included. Users can split bills, make utility payments, as well as send and receive money in the Fundall network and with other local banks.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Homzmart, an Egyptian-based marketplace startup, has secured $15 million in its Series A investment round, TechCrunch reports.\n\nIn February 2020, the startup\u2019s $1.3 million seed round was reported by Menabytes as one of the largest by an Egyptian startup. It, once again, surpasses previous records as it has now successfully closed the largest financing round in its sector in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nThe company was founded in 2019 by Mahmoud Ibrahim, former COO of Daraz \u2014 an online marketplace and logistics company that operates in South Asia and Southeast Asia \u2014 and Ibrahim Mohamed, former Head of Logistics at Jumia. Still, it didn\u2019t launch until the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis round of financing is co-led by China\u2019s MSA Capital \u2014 one of the investors in Homzmart\u2019s seed round in February 2020, alongside Nuwa Capital. Other participants include Rise Capital, Impact 46, EQ2 Ventures, and Outliers Venture Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomzmart claims the Egyptian furniture market is historically characterised by poor customer accessibility and high distribution costs for retailers.\n\nThe startup\u2019s business model, which involves collecting designs, price ranges, and other details of its retailers\u2019 products, handles high distribution costs for them by providing access to consumers \u2014 homeowners and professionals \u2014 who have flexible financing options.\n\nIt creates a one-stop-shop, hassle-free experience for consumers who are easily connected to retailers such as IKEA and Home Centre.\n\nHomzmart\u2019s platform incorporates artificial intelligence to optimise furniture sellers\u2019 content, with intelligent tools helping customers with purchasing decisions.\n\nAs Ibrahim said during the company\u2019s seed round, \u201cThere are 25 million people in the Middle East and North Africa region searching for home furnishing every month with no serious player serving them online.\u201d\n\nLaunched at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ibrahim expressed uncertainty about the company\u2019s survival due to anticipated behavioural changes in consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the reverse was the case as consumers seemed to like the product, resulting in more sales, as witnessed in most eCommerce and marketplaces during the height of the pandemic.\n\nMSA Capital\u2019s General Partner, Ben Harburg, cites this as one of the reasons the company joined in financing the startup again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the extreme vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of the Middle East\u2019s archaic offline retail ecosystem, logistics, and supply chain.\n\n\u201cInto the void stepped Homzmart as the next generation, digitally-enabled online marketplace and optimised logistics provider for large-item retail addressing both consumer and enterprise customers.\u201d\n\nHomzmart\u2019s founders\u2019 vast experience was another reason behind the firm\u2019s decision.\n\nHaving spent its first year in business understanding supply and demand, it now looks to scale its business model, expanding its reach across the region.\n\n\u201cWhatever we did in Egypt, we need to do across the region. Homzmart isn\u2019t looking to be just an Egyptian platform, rather a regional platform,\u201d said Ibrahim.\n\nIn keeping with this, Homzmart has strategically established operations close to Damietta City. Known as the region\u2019s largest manufacturing hub, Damietta would allow the company to streamline MENA\u2019s vertical industry supply chain.\n\nHomzmart currently showcases over 55,000 products from thousands of brands and merchants and claims to have 30x growth in sales. The online marketplace is tapping into the rapidly expanding $8 billion industry where 14 million customers in the region search online for furniture monthly.\n\nAs TechCrunch reports, Ibrahim says the company hopes to make sure it is building the right institutional infrastructure for its business and to ensure that after two or three years, it is building a very solid, multi-billion dollar business.\n\nPhotocredit: TechCrunch\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nCome learn strategies on how to get funding, grow your network and position your startup business for profit.

          "text": "East-Africa-based telecommunications company, Safaricom, ended its business year on March 31, 2021. The telecom giant marked 20 years of servicing the African market and released its financial report on Thursday, May 13, 2021.\n\nAs with many other businesses, the first half of the fiscal year was difficult for the company because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite a subdued financial performance, the company had some solid wins.\n\nLike the previous financial year, revenue from voice and messaging declined, with Internet data experiencing a revenue boost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMessaging revenue went from KSh 15,193.8 million (~$141,619) to KSh 13,602.4 million (~$126,787), which was an 11.7% drop. The Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for their monthly active messaging customers reduced from KSh 60.77 to Ksh52.7.\n\nFor voice services, revenue fell by 4.6%, with a decline from KSh 86,349.4 million ($804,826) to KSh 82,55.0 million ($769,473). The ARPU for active monthly voice customers went from KSh 287.16 to KSh 257.72.\n\nInternet revenue took an impressive leap from KSh 39,641.9 million ($369,513) to KSh 44,793.2 million ($417,554). With a year-on-year increase of 11.5%. This has been the trend as other telecom giants in Africa recorded revenue boosts in Internet data in recent financial reports.\n\nM-Pesa gets shaky\n\nIn this fiscal year, the company\u2019s mobile money platform, M-Pesa, experienced a slight dive.\n\nIn what happens to be the first of its kind, revenue dropped by 2.1% in the first half of the financial year, falling from KSh 84,382 billion ($786, 545,581) to KSh 82,647 billion ($770,410,517).\n\nThis could be because of fees waived on person-to-person (P2P), Bank to M-Pesa wallet (B2C), and M-Pesa to bank wallet (C2B) transactions of KSh 1,000 ($9.32) and below.\n\nThe waiver was to curtail the rapid spread of COVID-19. When the waiver ended in January 2021, P2P transaction charges were reduced by 45% for low-value transaction bands below KSh 7,500 ($69.91), while B2C and C2B transactions remained free.\n\nHowever, M-Pesa recovered significantly. Total M-Pesa transaction value grew by 58.2% YoY to KSh 22.4 trillion ($208.8 billion).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volume of transactions grew by 29.8% to eleven point six billion. Currently, M-Pesa accounts for 33.0% of Safaricom\u2019s service revenue.\n\nPlans for the new year include setting up 5G trials across more Kenyan cities. The report also reveals plans to launch an M-Pesa mobile application by the second half of the new fiscal year.\n\nFurthermore, Safaricom used the report to publicise its plans to integrate with Amazon. If this integration happens, M-Pesa users will be able to pay for goods with their mobile wallets on the eCommerce platform.\n\nImage credit ajleon on Wunderstock\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Boko Haram militants: Six reasons they have not been defeated, by BBC\n\nThe phrase that Nigerian militant group Boko Haram had been \u201ctechnically defeated\u201d is ringing increasingly hollow.\n\nSeven months into his first term in 2015 President Muhammadu Buhari coined the term, but the group and its offshoots have never gone away.\n\nThe military has managed to retake territory and dislodged the fighters from some of their hideouts. But a recent spike in deadly violence, focused in the north-east, where the Islamist group began its insurgency in 2009, has led many to ask what is at the root of the authorities\u2019 failure.\n\nAlready this year there have been nearly 100 attacks, according to one estimate. A number of military bases as well as towns, including Geidam and Damasak, a hub for aid workers, have been overrun. Hundreds have been killed and weapons, food and medicines have all been looted.\n\nThere are six main reasons why Boko Haram has not been defeated despite the government claims, experts say.\n\n1: Root causes not addressed\n\nAn over-reliance on a military strategy to confront Boko Haram is at the heart of the state\u2019s inability to deal with the threat, argues security analyst Kabiru Adamu from Beacon Consulting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, unfortunately, almost 11 or 12 years into the counter-insurgency operation, we are not seeing major successes,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\n\u201cYes, the military will dislodge the terrorists but then because they are still able to exercise influence, they\u2019re able to recruit, they\u2019re able to generate funding, they\u2019re able to acquire weaponry, then they regroup.\u201d\n\nExperts say that it is not that people in the north-east sympathise with Boko Haram and its splinter group, the Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province, but that neglect from the authorities and desperation often drive people into the hands of the militants.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that to address insurgency or terrorism, you need more than military operation. You need to address the root causes of the insurgency,\u201d Mr Adamu says.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we haven\u2019t seen enough efforts in that regard.\u201d\n\nHe points to a lack of good governance that leaves the population impoverished, frustrated and uneducated as \u201cone huge root cause\u201d.\n\nThere are major government initiatives that are meant to speed up development in the north-east, but little progress has been made.\n\nThere is also the National Counter-Terrorism Strategy which also involves economic development and counter-radicalisation, in addition to the deployment of troops. But Mr Adamu says it appears the strategy is not being fully implemented.\n\nOthers, like Security analyst at the Tony Blair Institute for Change, Bulama Bukarti, argue that along with deradicalisation there should be a huge surge in military activity similar to what was seen in Iraq and Syria when the Islamic State group\u2019s so-called caliphate was dismantled.\n\n2: Boko Haram\u2019s ability to recruit\n\nThe endemic poverty in parts of the region as well as the insurgents\u2019 violent methods enable the continued recruitment of generation after generation of fighters, experts say.\n\n\u201cPeople are readily available for recruitment just to survive,\u201d security expert Abdullahi Yalwa said, citing the problems of joblessness and poor governance.\n\nMr Bukarti highlights the \u201csystematic campaign of forced recruitment of young people\u201d.\n\nBorno state Governor, Babagana Zullum, recently told the BBC that the insurgents were even recruiting people who had previously been forced from their homes by the conflict itself.\n\n3: Lack of equipment\n\nEven when it comes to the fighting there is the problem of weaponry, according to Mr Adamu, who says that the military is ill-equipped.\n\nResearch by his firm, Beacon Consulting, found that there were about 6.5 million small arms and light weapons in circulation in Nigeria but just 586,000 are in the hands of security forces.\n\nIt is not the case that all of the remainder are being used by the Islamist militants, but the figures highlight that there are a huge amount of weapons available that are not in the military\u2019s control.\n\nMr Adamu also says that \u201cwhat we are seeing based on evidence is that these [armed] groups have a higher calibre of weapons, unfortunately, than the military\u201d.\n\n4: Corruption\n\nCorruption may be one thing that is holding the military back when it comes to improving its equipment. It is suspected that a lot of money meant to bolster the campaign against Boko Haram has ended up in officials\u2019 pockets.\n\nMr Yalwa says that in some cases the fight against Boko Haram is not being fought with \u201csincerity\u201d and \u201cit seems some people have turned it into merchandise and are into self-enrichment\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, the military was hamstrung by a US arms embargo over human rights abuses. President Buhari and his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, both complained that this was hampering counter-insurgency efforts.\n\nBut this was lifted by President Donald Trump in 2018 and as a result Nigeria is expecting the delivery of Super Tucano aircraft. This should build on the military\u2019s air superiority, which Mr Adamu believes is not being used to its full advantage.\n\nAlthough there are claims that even this superiority is not paying off.\n\n5: Military strategy not working\n\nMr Bukarti told the BBC the insurgents appear to have \u201cunderstood and adapted to the pattern of military airstrikes\u201d and are taking advantage of the difficult terrain in Nigeria\u2019s north-east to evade military attacks.\n\nBoko Haram at a glance\n\nFounded in 2002\n\nInitially focused on opposing Western education\n\nLaunched military operations in 2009\n\nGained attention in 2014 with Chibok kidnappings\n\nPledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2015\n\nSplit into two factions in 2016\n\nline\n\nThere are also other aspects of the strategy that have been criticised.\n\nOver the past year the army has been withdrawing troops from smaller bases and concentrating them in large formations known as Super Camps.\n\nThis strategy was adopted in early 2020 when soldiers were under regular attack and their weapons were being stolen.\n\nHowever, it has left vast swathes of rural communities unprotected, analysts say.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence suggesting an increase in attacks on communities between the period when the Super Camps were created and now. So clearly the Super Camps left the rural communities more vulnerable,\u201d argues Mr Adamu.\n\nThis has also devastated the livelihoods of people in north-east Nigeria who rely on fishing and crop farming, and had an impact on food production.\n\nThe military is also hampered by gaps in intelligence gathering as well as being unable to plug information leaks.\n\nThis means that sometimes it appears that \u201cthe insurgents are ahead of the military\u201d, Mr Yalwa says.\n\nThe army disputes this alleged problem. Its spokesperson Mohammed Yarima recently said that \u201ctroops are in high fighting spirit and determined to as ever to clear the [north-east] region and the country of vestiges of Boko Haram terrorists\u201d.\n\n6: Boko Haram\u2019s influence is spreading\n\nAdding to the problems of dealing with Boko Haram is that the insurgency, once confined to the north-east, appears to be spreading.\n\nThere are concerns that armed criminal gangs in other parts of the north and centre of the country are forging links with the militants.\n\nLast year, Boko Haram released a video claiming a presence in Niger state which is far from its usual area of operations. The authorities there issued a statement in March saying Boko Haram fighters had infiltrated the state occupying forests and attacking communities.\n\nLast December, then army chief Lt Gen Yusuf Tukur Buratai suggested that the fight against Boko Haram could continue for another 20 years if the civilian and military approaches were not better co-ordinated.\n\nThe hard-pressed residents of north-eastern Nigeria will hope that warning does not come to pass.",

Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of the state said the operation was timely, following recent developments and increase in the level of crime and criminality within the zone.\n\n\u201cThis operation cannot come at a better time than now with the heightened insecurity in the zone and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the operation will help to rejig the security architecture of the southeast and restore lasting peace,\u2019\u2019 Ugwuanyi said.\n\nHe assured the IGP of the cooperation and continuous support of his government to the police and other security agencies in the state.\n\nAlso, the Deputy IGP in-charge of the zone, Mr Joseph Egbunike, applauded the acting IGP for coming out with the initiative.\n\nEgbunike, who is also the Theatre Commander of the operation, promised that the team would return and restore peace and \u201ccreate the environment of safety for all\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cMy IG sir, you do not need to worry. We have enough able and capable officers and men on ground to discharge this operation and get the needed result,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the event was attended by Commissioners of Police and deputy governors from the southeast states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo.\n\n...",

We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed along with training on improvised explosives.\n\n\u201cBut there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy.\n\n\u201cWe know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism in the region.\n\n\u201cWe, the leaders of Sahel countries, must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also noted that the fallout of the Libyan crisis had flushed the whole region with weapons, making disputes and competitions far more destructive.\n\n\u201cIt is upon these conditions, the lies and propaganda of terrorists who falsely claim to be Islamists promising salvation can find an audience,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe observed that military gains might not provide the whole solution to the security challenges, saying governments must also provide environments conducive to economic prosperity of their citizens.\n\n\u201cWe know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows.\n\n\u201cThe solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do not improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari said.\n\n...",

Amos Ogbonnaya, by political thugs.\n\nThe victim was said to have been abducted at a gunpoint after he was bombarded with series of threatening text messages and phone calls by some politicians in the state shortly \u201cafter he made some revealing expose on the systemic corruption that has become the modus of the third tier administration by the state government.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released to journalists on Tuesday in Abuja by the AESID President, Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, he urged the the Inspector General of Police to immediately constitute a special crack team to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cThe occasion, we recall was a discussion programme on the African Independent Television, AIT penultimate week wherein Ogbonnaya had carefully reeled out how the Governor and his surrogates using the State\u2019s Joint Account Committee, JAC, siphon hundreds of millions of Federal Government\u2019s monthly Local Government allocations while handing the administrators peanuts to run their offices.\n\n\u201cIn outrightly condemning this ugly incident which we now consider as one attack on Ebonyians too many buoyed by the simple fact of the intolerant disposition of the government to criticisms and opposing views, we ask both the Governor and the CP who has shown obvious negligence in arresting the suspects should step aside.\n\n\u201cAESID urges the Inspector General of Police to immediately constitute a special crack team to investigate and bring these evil perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cWe feel justified in this request because a lot of attacks on innocent Ebonyians since Umahi ascended to power have been swept under the carpet, therefore emboldening the political thugs that are often recruited as willing tools to unleash mayhem on peaceful individuals just for baring their minds on issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAll that have been fingered in this terrible incident must therefore be brought to book without further delay no matter how highly placed they may be.\u201d\n\nWhile cautioning the state government against further attack on opposition leaders, the group described the development as open invitation to anarchy if such is not addressed in Ebonyi state.\n\nReacting to the recent crisis in Effium community in Ohaukwu local government area of the state, the accountability group said the claims by the state government that peace had return to the war-ravaged area were untrue.\n\n\u201cWe urge Nigerians and the world to disregard and discountenance the claims of the Governor because killings are still going on in the area even as we speak. For we strongly believe that the blood of those innocent and defenceless citizens will yet cry for justice on the head of all those who have a hand in the Effium carnage.\n\n\u201cConclusively, we pray for total return of peace in every troubled part of the state as we charge Governor Umahi to focus on fighting the anthropogenic hunger and poverty that his administration has made an official policy in the state rather than unleashing his army of thugs against Ebonyians who insist on doing things right!,\u201d the group said.",

We want to do as much as we can in all our communities so that we can also leave with our heads high that we had done our best to see that we have put Ekiti on a solid footing and our communities in a better place.\n\n\u201cEvery community wants government support and road construction is one of the ways of measuring impact in terms of development in the community. These are very tough times and you know it yourself, all I can say is that I would look into it and see how we can help achieve the objective. All that we are focusing on now is to just pay salaries so that our people would at least be able to maintain themselves with little that is available to them.\n\nEarlier, Oba Aderemi Obaleye commended Governor Fayemi for his various support to the community including the release of N5 million towards the ultra-modern palace project, channelization of parts of the community and support for the community Town Hall project among others.",

          "text": "*Says IPOB, ESN constituting security threat\n\nBy Moses Oyediran, Enugu\n\nThe Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba has charged officers and men of the police force to make a statement by taking the battle to the doorstep of criminal elements in the South East region.\n\nThis is as he noted that the conduct of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) is causing security threats in the region.\n\nSpeaking at the flagged off of a special operation for the Southeast geo-political zone code-named \u201cOperation Restore Peace\u201d in Enugu, Baba expressed dismay over the insecurity situation in the Southeast.\n\nHe disclosed that the responsibility of the police is to restore law and order adding that the police under the current dispensation will not shy away from its primary mandate of securing the lives and property of the citizens.\n\nAccording to him the \u201cOperation RP\u201d was conceptualized to achieve this goal adding it will take place simultaneously in all the states in the Southeast.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values.\n\nThe time is now. Today\u2019s launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 by the Nigeria Police is aimed in this direction and it follows the directives of Mr. President to the Nigeria Police to re-evaluate and employ new operational strategies to stem the tide of violence and secessionist agenda not only in the South East but across the country.\n\n\u201cThe trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria Police, Military and other security agencies are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\n\nAside from this, the deepening inter-ethnic prejudice and intolerance in the region is also occasioning unjustifiable inter-ethnic violence and counter-violence. Apart from the massive loss of property and fatalities to lives, the violent campaigns are beginning to have a damaging effect on the socio-economic development of the region.\n\n\u201cThis trend is being compounded by the illegal proliferation of firearms as well as the deployment of the social media by the leadership of IPOB to indoctrinate, misinform, and misdirect south easterners towards the path of violent separatism.\n\nThis evolving trend constitutes a major threat to our nation\u2019s internal security and national unity and, hence, requires urgent sets of all-inclusive actions in order to roll back the disastrous tide.\n\n\u201cViolent agitation and associated crimes, particularly, those that endanger the lives, property and livelihood of the civil populace and threaten our national unity, peace and security in the form being currently noticed do not and can never represent our traditional values as a people.\n\nUnfortunately, the current armed campaign by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) is constituting a major threat not only to these values, but to our national security and peaceful co-existence as a nation.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the resort to terror tactics, disregard to constitutional processes and disrespect for democratic standards to advance their interests of creating an ungovernable space in the region informed the decision of the Federal Government to outlaw IPOB.\n\nAccording to Baba, \u201cIn spite of this, and despite the concerted efforts of State Governors, revered Traditional Rulers, religious Bodies and well-meaning personalities in the Zone, the group continues to widen their armed insurrection and destabilizing campaigns with fatal consequences.\n\nThis they are doing without regard to the fact that no nation develops to its optimal potential in an environment where constitutional governance and national harmony are threatened by violent insurrection as being championed by them.\n\nThe IGP called for support from people, media and other sister security agencies to end the insecurity in the south east region.\n\n\u201cThe key factor in addressing the prevailing security threats in the South East is that we should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality, and resolve to work with the Police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\n\n\u201cWhile we shall do all within our powers and means to achieve these tasks, we do acknowledge that we cannot do it alone. Indeed, no Police agency anywhere in the world, no matter how well-trained, equipped or motivated, can solely achieve its security and safety mandate without the support of the community.\n\nConsequently, we shall be collaborating closely with the Armed Forces, the intelligence community and other sister security agencies in this operation.\n\nIn order to fully achieve the objectives of this special operation we also solicit the full support of the civil populace, particularly, traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth associations, market bodies, cultural associations and professionals among others.\n\n\u201cPermit me to also use this opportunity to specially appeal for the support and understanding of media practitioners across the print, electronic and the social media.\n\nWhile their roles in advancing the freedom of information principle is appreciated, patriotism and ethical values place an obligation on them to avoid sensational and unverified reportage on internal security operations.\n\nThis is because; it can mislead and create unjustifiable sense of insecurity among the citizens, while unwittingly advancing the interests of the criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 in Enugu today is the first in the line of our strategic Action Plan to restore peace across the country and in the coming days the special operation will be extended to other parts of the country to address peculiar crimes including banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery in other geopolitical Zones.\n\nIt is to be emphasized that \u2018Operation RP\u2019 will cover all the States within the South East Geopolitical Zone. I am confident that with the support of all strategic stakeholders, the operation will in due course; change the current security narratives in the Zone for good\u201d, he stated.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuayi described the flag off of \u201cOperation Restore Peace\u201d as timing of the special operation as timely and compelling considering the security challenges in the region pledging his support towards the success of the operation.",

Today, the Kaduna state government reviewed the sundry criminal actions that have defined the campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness waged by the NLC.\n\n\u201cKDSG considers as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days. The state government commends citizens for remaining calm amidst this assault on their rights and comfort and their businesses.\n\n\u201cHowever, KDSG cannot be expected to tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients, unlawful trespass into public facilities and the wanton use of coercion and restraints of personal freedom by the NLC.\n\n\u201cAlso, KDSG cannot ignore the illegal pressures brought to disrupt the operations of banks and other private business whose staff and customers do not have any industrial dispute with the state or any other government. KDSG regrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities. Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\n\u201cReports from Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disclosed that some identified nurses disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday, 17th May 2021.

They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements;\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike.

All MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service;\n\n\u201cKDSG views the actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens.

We will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna state even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum.

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party PDP EBONY! The state caucus Of The National Assembly has accused the State Governor Dave Umahi of Arming youths in the state in the guise of Ebubeagu against perceived political enemies.\n\nThe group in a press briefing yesterday in Abuja on the deteriorating security situation in Ebonyi State said \u201cwe the undersigned, who are serving members of the National Assembly, wish to draw the attention of the relevant Security Agencies in the country to the deteriorating security situation in Ebonyi State, occasioned by the indiscriminate arming of known Cultists, and Agents of the Ebonyi State Government\n\nContinuing they said as lawmakers and responsible citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we are alarmed and concerned by the senseless killing of security personnel in the lawful discharge of their duties. This situation has been further compounded in Ebonyi State by the wide scale distribution of pump-action and AK-47 rifles and ammunition to young men throughout the 13 Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State by the State Government under the guise of vigilante/Ebubeagu. As it stands today in Ebonyi State, it is impossible to draw a line between the criminal activities of agents of the State Government, and that of other groups. Today, Ebonyi State is awash with weapons supplied and distributed by the State Government, to persons who are undocumented, nor trained in weapons handling ostensibly for use against perceived political opponents.\n\n\u201d It is important to state here that Governor Nweze Umahi\u2019s resort to arming thugs and Cultists across Ebonyi State is his response to the refusal of major political stakeholders in the State who rejected and refused to decamp with him from the PDP to the APC. For this reason, Governor Umahi has decided to procure and distribute arms and ammunition to thugs, cultists and some of his appointees under the guise of vigilante/Ebube-agu to intimidate and stifle the Peoples Democratic Party in Ebonyi State. It is for this reason that Ebonyi State has become the first and only state in the South East to inaugurate and arm the so-called Ebube-Agu.\n\n\u201d As law abiding citizens, we have written to the Inspector General of Police and heads of relevant Security Agencies on the deteriorating security situation in Ebonyi State. In those petitions, we have documented violent attacks, attempted murder and murder of Ebonyi citizens by agents of the State Government, in the most recent past.\n\nThe latest of these heinous crimes is the attempted murder of one Barrister Amos Ogbonnaya, a former coordinator of a Development centre in Ebonyi State. The said Barrister Amos on the 4\u2018 of May 2021 had appeared on an AIT live programme (JIGSAW) and spoke on the corruption and poor governance activities of the Ebonyi State Government. On the 13\u00b0\u201d of May, 2021, Barrister Amos was kidnapped in his village, Okposi, by a gang led by the Personal Assistant to the Governor named Chinonso Obasi aka \u201cCONSIDER\u201d in broad day light, and operating in a State Government owned white Hilux vehicle. By sheer act of providence, Barr. Amos was not buried in a shallow grave which had already been dug, but remains incapacitated and at risk of losing both of his legs in a private hospital at Enugu.\n\n\u201c. Only last week, Governor Umahi organised what he termed Town Hall Security meetings at the State capital Abakaliki. However, in those meetings, the Governor merely used the platform to issue threats and incite violence and public hatred against PDP members of the National Assembly and other perceived political opponents.\n\n\u201c. We shall end this Press briefing by inviting the heads of the relevant security Agencies to note as follows:\n\n(i) That the Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi is misusing the Ebube Agu Security outfit to proliferate arms in Ebonyi State. The world needs to know that his target is not criminals but Political opponents.\n\n(ii) The Ebonyi State Government has distributed dozens of guns\n\n(Pump-action and AK-47 and ammunition across the state to individuals who are accountable to him. We have pictorial evidence of Development centre coordinators and his other staff clutching guns and other dangerous weapons. We also have audio evidence of the Governor\u2019s younger brother, Mr Austine Umahi, addressing agents of the Ebonyi State Government on how to deploy their weapons on perceived political opponents.\n\n(iii) That Mr Garba Aliyu, who is the Commissioner of Police in Ebonyi State, is pliable in the hand of the Governor and thereby leaving law abiding citizens at the mercy of gun totting vigilantes/Ebube Agu.\n\n(iv) That every effort must be made by the relevant Security agencies to recover and mop up the arms and ammunition in Ebonyi State which Governor David Umahi has distributed to individuals who were neither trained nor documented as to keep track record of those in possession of f\u00e9rearms in Ebonyi State.\n\n(v) That the Inspector General of Police should note that Governor Umahi should be held directly responsible should any harm befall any member of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe legislators were Senator (Dr) Sam Ominyi Egwu. Senator Obinna Ogba Senator Michael Ama Nnachi. Rt. Hon. Sylvester Ogbaga\n\nRt. Hon. Igariwey Iduma Enwo Rt. Hon. Chukwuma Nwazunku . Rt. Hon. Anayo Nwonu\n\nHon. Livinus Makwe",

          "text": "Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Salihu Lukman, has described as needless and trite the resolutions by the governors of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at their Ibadan meeting demanding devolution of power to states. Governors under the banner of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had Monday met in Ibadan the Oyo State capital and came up with a six-point resolution which included demand for devolution of power to states. The governors, who met at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, IITA, also endorsed the ban on open grazing and the call for restructuring. But reacting to the resolutions, Lukman stated that since the call for restructuring has become an issue of national imperative, the PDP governors should rather engage the leadership of the National Assembly to speed up processes of Constitutional amendment initiated by the APC governors as a result of the recommendations contained in the report of APC Committee on True Federalism. In a statement issued Tuesday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, the PGF boss insisted that the PDP lack the moral standing to demand for issuance of executive bill by president Muhammadu Buhari to the national assembly on restructuring having failed to initiate all the recommendations being proposed now in its 16 years of reign.\n\n\u201d Having mismanaged opportunities to initiate all the recommendations being proposed by the PDP Governors between 1999 and 2015, how can anybody in PDP claimed any moral standing to demand for any executive bill? If the issue is as simple as getting the President to transmit executive bill, what stops all the PDP Presidents from initiating it for sixteen years,\u201d he said.\n\nLukman carpeted the PDP govs for failing to implement the reforms and restructuring instituted by the president Buhari\u2019s administration through the executive order 10 issued to grant financial autonomy to the state judiciary and legislature.\n\n\u201cWith all the smearing campaign going on, APC government has been able to do a lot in terms of facilitating devolution of powers from the Federal Government to the states. In line with recommendations of the APC Committee on True Federalism, many APC representatives in the two chambers of the National Assembly have sponsored bills for relevant amendments to our laws. PDP Governors, in the spirit of the resolutions adopted in their Ibadan meeting, should call on their representatives to support the passage of the bills.\n\n\u201cBeyond issues of proposed bills in the National Assembly, it is to the credit of the APC under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari that issues of autonomy for states\u2019 assemblies and judiciary as provided in the 1999 Nigerian Constitution as amended are given full effect through Executive Order 10. What are the PDP Governors doing in their states to comply? These are issues that were completely ignored by the PDP throughout their tenure between 1999 and 2015,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "There is a new twist in the ongoing protest in Nigeria\u2019s northwestern Kaduna State. Governor El-Rufai has authorised the state\u2019s Ministry of Health to relieve all nurses below Grade Level 14 for embarking on an unlawful strike.\n\nThe governor also claims to have reports that suggest three nurses from the Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day-old baby in an incubator on Monday. According to Mr El-Rufai, \u201cthe names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby\u201d.\n\nMr El-Rufai has also warned that academic staff of the state-owned university (Kaduna State University) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\nHe again declared Ayuba Wabba, the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress and other labour leaders wanted, assuring that they will be \u201cvigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts\u201d.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cthe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike. Salaries that could have gone to them are to be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty. \u201cAny academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed. The authorities of KASU are to submit a copy of the attendance register for all categories of staff daily to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education \u201cAll MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service \u201cThe Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed The governor took the decisions on Tuesday in a statement signed by Muyiwa Adekeye, the Special Adviser to the Governor (Media & Communication).\n\n\u201cAyuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC are declared wanted, and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts. They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements.\u201d\n\nThe governor described the protests by organised labour and led by the president Mr Wabba as a campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness.\n\nThe statement also noted that the state government \u201cconsiders as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days. The state government commends citizens for remaining calm amidst this assault on their rights and comfort and their businesses\u201d.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "India has reported a record 4,329 fatalities in the past 24 hours as total virus cases since the pandemic began swept past 25 million and the country registered more than 260,000 new cases.\n\nThe numbers continue a trend of falling cases after infections dipped below 300,000 for the first time in weeks on Monday. Active cases in the country also decreased by more than 165,000 on Tuesday \u2014 the biggest dip in weeks.\n\nBut deaths have continued to rise and hospitals are still swamped by patients.\n\nIndia has recorded nearly 280,000 virus deaths since the pandemic began. Experts warn that both the number of deaths and total reported cases are likely vast undercounts.\n\nInfections in India have surged since February in a disastrous turn blamed on more contagious variants as well as government decisions to allow massive crowds to gather for religious festivals and political rallies.\n\nIn the last month, cases have more than tripled and reported deaths have gone up six times \u2014 but testing has only increased by 1.6 times, according to Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan tracking India\u2019s battle with the virus. With infections outrunning testing capabilities, there are fears that many cases are going undetected.\n\nExperts also say India has lagged behind in doing the testing needed to track and better understand a worrisome virus variant first detected in the country. On Monday, the Health Ministry said 17 new labs will be brought online to help track variants.\n\nThe variant first identified in India has prompted global concern \u2014 most notably in Britain, where it has more than doubled in a week, defying a sharp nationwide downward trend in infections.\n\nMeanwhile, ever since India opened up vaccinations to all adults this month, the pace of administering shots has plunged. Many states have said they don\u2019t have enough stock to give out. The southern state of Karnataka, for example, has temporarily halted its drive to inoculate those aged between 18 and 44 at government-run centers due to a shortage of doses.",
