          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nLagos State Government on Tuesday unveiled 500 mini buses to ensure efficient intra-city transportation in the state.\n\nThe 500 shuttle buses, known as First and Last Mile (FLM), are the first phase of the planned 5,000 mini buses aimed at boosting transportation system in Lagos State.\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling of the First and Last Mile (FLM) Bus Scheme at Ikeja, Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu said that buses would take care of commuting between the main transit corridors and the hearts of the communities, where the bulk of people reside and where the high capacity buses would normally not pass through.\n\nSanwo-Olu said that bus scheme was an important milestone to achieving the intermodal transport system which would give the people the choices they deserved, reducing congestion and journey times, and improving the quality of life.\n\nHe said that it was also about improving and guaranteeing the security of lives and property of Lagos residents.\n\nAccording to him, in February 2020, the state government restricted the operations of commercial motorcycles (Okadas) in six Local Government Areas (LGAs), nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs), and 10 major highways in the state.\n\n\u201dThe full implementation of a safer and more efficient alternative transport solution, that takes out the need for Okadas and replaces them with the FLM buses, thus curbing the incidence of Okada-related crimes and robberies.\n\n\u201dWe will continue to monitor and assess the situation over the next one-two months and tweaking our response appropriately to ensure that ultimately, we are winning the war against crime and criminality associated with Okadas.\n\n\u201dIf we do not see any improvement, we will have no choice but to go for a full and complete ban on Okada activities in the state.\n\n\u201dWe are very much aware of the role transportation plays in the development of any economy. Indeed, it is the backbone of any thriving economy.\n\n\u201dOver the last two years, we have taken steps to birth and bequeath to Lagos State enduring transport infrastructure and systems, which future generations would be proud of.\n\n\u201dOur Bus Reform Initiative (BRI) is an ambitious road transportation effort, that encompasses a number of transport projects, including the construction of bus terminals and interchanges,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said that for a successful operation of the scheme, the government had recognised the roles of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) as major stakeholders in the entire Bus Reform Initiative.\n\nHe appealed to the operators of the FLM Bus Scheme to play according to the rules, as maximum penalty would be imposed in cases where existing agreements and extant Road Traffic Laws were infringed upon.\n\nThe Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, said that the unveiling of the bus scheme was a concerted effort to fulfil the vision for an integrated multi-modal transport system in the state.\n\nOladeinde said that the state\u2019s transportation requirements were driven by the State\u2019s Strategic Transport Master Plan prepared by the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA).\n\nREAD ALSO: NIS suspends processing of new passports to clear backlog\n\nHe said that in line with the Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, the Lagos State Government through the Ministry of Transportation and LAMATA had put in place various measures aimed at readjusting the transportation strategies to accommodate the first/last mile transportation system.\n\nAccording to him, the first/last-mile transportation system is all-inclusive, safe, convenient, affordable, accessible, and in line with global practices.\n\nMrs Abimbola Akinajo, the Managing Director, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), said that the First and Last mile bus scheme were small capacity (7-11) passenger buses which would travel on routes designed to take one closest to and from origin and destination.\n\nAkinajo said that 286 routes had been identified as the FLM routes and the routes have been designed to be around 5km but always ensuring that connectivity was achieved for intermodal transportation.\n\n\u201dFor ease of operation of the scheme, the state has been delineated into eight zones. The zones are Zone 1: Ikeja and Ketu; Zone 2: Oshodi, Mushin and Surulere, then Zone 3: Berger, Yaba and Oyingbo.\n\n\u201dAlso, Zone 4: Lagos Island, Ajah and Ibeju Lekki, Zone 5: Iyana-ipaja and Agege; Zone 6: Mile 2, Iyana-Iba and Ajeromi; Zone 7: Ikorodu and Zone 8: Epe and Badagry.\n\n\u201dImmediately after the launch, operations shall commence in zones 2,3,4,5, and 7 which represent the first phase of the bus scheme.\n\n\u201dThe FLM scheme will be run by private operators who will work with the state. For participation in the bus scheme, the state government shall support private operators in the bus acquisition under a Bus Finance Scheme.\n\n\u201dThe private operator shall be required to make 20 per cent down payment to be eligible to come under the Bus Finance Scheme. The repayment period for the Bus Finance Scheme shall be for a period of 36 months and the state has negotiated an interest rate of 10 per cent for the outstanding amount,\u201d Akinajo said.\n\n[NAN]\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "By Owei David\n\nSIR: I write to register my dismay over the ongoing admission process in the Niger Delta University, NDU, Wilberforce Island, Amassoma, in Bayelsa State. The news filtering out of the institution about the 2020/2021 admission process is not palatable and it leaves a sour taste in the mouth.\n\nNDU was established to bridge the yawning gap deriving from the educationally-disadvantaged nature of the state, for prospective indigene students from travelling far distances to gain admission into tertiary institutions across the country.\n\nBefore this time and during the formative stages of the institution, the admission process into the school was purely based on merit and other genuine considerations. But today the opposite is the case. To gain admission to NDU is harder than gaining admission to schools abroad. Also, the process has become so cumbersome that it is no longer based on merit; rather it is on man-know-man, connections upon connections, more so, list upon lists, submitted by influential individuals, politicians, community leaders, government officials, lecturers, among others.\n\nOf course, over two admission lists have so far been released. Within one week, two students would be admitted, thereafter, another five students. NDU keeps admitting one student at a time. The next week another three students would be admitted. Sadly, that is the truth of the matter.\n\nThe admission process in NDU has turned to a nightmare. Parents and guardians have to pass through the eye of a needle to secure admission for their children and wards as the admission process is suffused with sharp corrupt practices. Parents had to secure admission for their children by paying huge sums of money to those at the computer section to gain admission and to change courses. Therefore, the institution has become a dashed hope for prospective young students.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOur system is highly inequitable and plagued by opportunity gaps in all corners. In spite of the exorbitant school fees forced down on students by the government, NDU charges over N50,000 as acceptance fee before being allowed to register. And students are agonizing over the huge fees, as indigent students are finding it difficult to pay.\n\nInstitutions offering admission to prospective students is for public good. Therefore, NDU\u2019s unholy admission process is not for public good. Let admission into the institution be based on merit in order to safeguard the future and credibility of the institution.\n\nAs it is now, many poor people\u2019s children cannot gain admission into NDU.",

          "title": "Rotate Oyo governorship among senatorial districts",
          "text": "By Sunday Adepoju\n\nSIR: Nigeria\u2019s problems have aggravated due to the perceived domination of the national scene by a tribe at the detriment of over four 400 minority groups making up Nigeria. The tribe, it appears, wants to remain in power at all cost. Beginning from the era of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as a prime minister till date, one of the three major ethnic nationalities had dominated the national politics. This is because there is no place for zoning or rotational formula in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSimilarly and situating the scenario to Oyo State, a common feature of the politics of the \u2018pace setter\u2019 state since the return of democracy in 1999 is the seeming suppression of other zones of the state by Ibadan, the state capital, from occupying the exalted Agodi Government House. The state, like other states, comprises three senatorial districts: Oyo South, Oyo Central and Oyo North. Beyond this demarcation, the state is divided into zones: Ibadan, Ibarapa, Ogbomoso, Oke-Ogun, and Oyo.\n\nHistorically, Oyo State was founded on February 3, 1976 when the defunct Western Region was divided into Ogun, Ondo and Oyo states. With the composition, the present Osun State was part of the old Oyo State. In the old Oyo State, Chief Bola Ige, from Esa Oke (present Osun), was governor between October 1, 1979 and September 30, 1983. From October 1, 1983, Dr Victor Omololu Olunloyo, an Ibadan man, was in the saddle before the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of December 31, 1983. Later, Chief Kolapo Olawuyi Ishola came in on January 2, 1992 and left in November 17, 1993. It is imperative to note that during the governorship of Chief Bola Ige, his deputy, Chief Bisi Akande, was from Ila-Orangun, in the present Osun State. He was never from Ibadan.\n\nHowever, since the return of democracy in the Fourth Republic in 1999, there has been six different four-term dispensations and, interestingly, five were from Ibadan. It went in this order: 1999 (Ibadan), 2003 (Ibadan), 2007 (Ogbomoso), 2011 (Ibadan), 2015 (Ibadan), 2019 (Ibadan). Out of the three senatorial districts, Oyo South, with 11 local government areas from Ibadan and Ibarapa zones, has always had it, except when Oyo North, comprising 13 local government areas form Oke-Ogun and Ogbomoso zones, narrowly had it in 2007 in the person of Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala of Ogbomoso extraction. Oyo Central, with nine local government areas (covering some parts of Ogbomoso, Oyo and Ibadan less city), never tasted it since 1999.\n\nThis present dominance is ironical, going by the history predating the creation of 12 states from the regions. During the era of regionalism, for instance, only Ikenne, in the present Ogun State, and Ogbomoso, in the present Oyo State, produced the sage, Chief Jeremiah Obafemi Awolowo, and the polyglot, Chief Samuel Ladoke Akintola, as premiers of the Old Western Region respectively. They were never from Oluyole.\n\nThe equitable rotational governorship in Oyo State among the three senatorial districts would, no doubt, give room for even development; create a sense of belonging for the other two districts; avoid the domineering role of Ibadan; open the chance for a large spectrum of competent, exposed and brilliant citizens from the other zones and districts to bring their wealth of experience and develop the state. Many of the brilliant competent people aspiring to be governor, outside Ibadan, would have been told that they would have been the best fit for the job if not because they are non-Ibadan indigenes. And aspirants in this regard have always wondered why their place of origin is a factor working against them and why their origin is a measure of their competence.\n\nIn a way, allowing other zones to taste the power will mean so much for the people outside the state capital. For instance, when Alao-Akala was in power, he would always spend weekends in Ogbomoso, his home town. This greatly boosted the economy of the zones because of the avalanche of his aides and contractors that would visit him. So many people across other zones got political appointments. It is logical to say that if no governor can emerge without the support of the voters from other zones and districts, then, why must it be the exclusive preserve of a zone out of five?\n\nAlbeit, recognising that the Nigerian Constitution does not accommodate the zoning arrangement, this piece is, therefore, a clarion call on the political class, political parties, activists, traditional rulers as custodians of culture and tradition, and the electorate to critically rise above primordial sentiments and make our towns, cities and senatorial districts equitable for all and sundry.",

In unison, their excellencies, two of them represented by their deputies, took a bold, far-reaching step.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey gathered penultimate Tuesday in Asaba, capital of Delta State, reviewed the grim situation in the country and reached a clincher, a sort of \u2018enough is enough\u2019 vow. Their decision has already been ricocheting like a rocket across the land.\n\nThe testy reactions to the governors\u2019 meeting were expected because, given their excellencies\u2019 different political persuasions, geographical fissures and primordial impulses, forging a common front the way they did was ordinarily considered a tall order. However, in a commendable show of goodwill and political maturity, the governors rose above those narrow considerations and coalesced under the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum (SGF) for the overriding common good.\n\nThey released a strong, 12-point communique, read at the end of the meeting by their chairman, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, who is the governor of Ondo State.\n\nI am more interested in four of the issues, viz: The ban on open grazing, including the movement of cattle by foot into and within the south; restructuring; review of key federal appointments to reflect federal character and the call for national dialogue.\n\nThe ban placed on open grazing is long overdue because, like the governors rightly noted, open grazing has been at the heart of the bloody herders- farmers clashes, in which many farmers and others in the south have been killed and their female relations sexually assaulted.\n\nThe farmer- victims have been whining and yelping in agony, but their outcries have largely been ignored by the authorities who have the predilection for welshing on their promises to secure the people. What is required now, therefore, is for the governors to walk their talk by vociferously enforcing the ban on open grazing. That is the first step towards freeing their people from the rampaging killer-kidnappers.\n\nThe next and most important step is to, as soon as possible, flush out the killer-herders, bandits and other criminals now holed up in the thick forests of most of the states in the south. This they can achieve by sparing nothing in strengthening and arming the local security in their respective states within tolerable legal limits, to be able to adequately tackle the heavily armed marauders hibernating in those forests.\n\nThe operation to flush out criminals should be carried out simultaneously in all the southern states, so that the criminals, escaping from the heat of fire, should not be allowed any safe haven in other states to relocate to.\n\nHowever, as a more enduring solution to the herders-farmers challenge, I ally with the governors to, with the cooperation of the federal government, work out an \u201calternative and modern livestock management system\u201d that will afford peace-loving herders the opportunity to continue to ply their trade with ease.\n\nRanching remains the best mode of rearing cattle in these modern times. While the cattle reared through ranching are usually fatter, healthier and more productive, those reared through the traditional itinerant method are usually lean, sickly and less productive, having been taken through the trauma of thousands of kilometres\u2019 trek through the bush path.\n\nOn the restructuring issue, it is unfortunate that many people in the North have continued to misconstrue the South\u2019s spirited campaign in this direction as a ploy to divide the country. On the contrary, restructuring remains the only way to preserve the indivisibility of the country. This is because the nation can no longer be sustained by the present level of legendary lopsided distribution of economic, educational, employment and political opportunities, skewed heavily in favour of a section of the country, as well as the imbalances and injustices in the system. Restructuring thus offers an avenue to redress the unfair system that has tended to reduce a section of the country to \u2018second class\u2019 citizens in their country of birth. It is important to, through restructuring, ameliorate the age-long pent-up grievances, most of which have provided fertile grounds for the current renewed self-determination agitations.\n\nLike the governors have rightly advocated, the country is ripe to be restructured in a way that will also allow state police (because the central policing system has become burdensomely ineffective) and the review of revenue allocation formula that will channel more resources to \u201cthe sub-regional governments\u201d in the spirit of true federalism.\n\nFurthermore, states should now be allowed to harness the solid mineral resources that are wasting away in their domains because the federal government that has the statutory hold on those resources are merely sitting on them, choosing to rather focus more attention on oil revenue. But by allowing the states the leeway to harness those resources and pay taxes to the centre, they will be able to significantly shore up their Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and drastically reduce the tendency to rely solely on the monthly \u201chandouts\u201d from the centre.\n\nAgain, the Buhari administration has exhibited a high level of nepotism in the area of federal appointments, most especially those of key security agencies. Most of the commanding positions in the security agencies are held by people from a particular ethnic stock in spite of the highly heterogeneous setup like ours.\n\nIt was only recently that two southerners (from Edo and Delta States) were appointed service chiefs after a long-drawn outcry from Nigerians. These lopsided appointments are partly at the root of the worsening insecurity conundrum, over which the nation\u2019s foundation is now tottering, because the security agencies, headed mostly by the Fulani, ostensibly lack the will to tame the murderous herders, who have been on a raping, kidnapping and killing binge, especially in the South. President Mohammadu Buhari government\u2019s loud pro-Fulani \u2018body language\u2019 does not help matters. It is time, therefore, we reviewed those appointments to reflect federal character, like ministerial appointments, as their excellencies have canvassed.",

          "title": "Open letter to southern governors: Rising above partisan politics",
          "text": "By Afe Babalola\n\nI congratulate the 17 governors from different political parties in the southern part of the country for rising above partisan politics and for the 12-point resolution published after their meeting in Asaba, the Delta State Capital on Tuesday May 12. If Nigerian politicians have been rising above party politics the way the 17 governors did, the country would not have been plunged into the problems afflicting the country today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf the 12-point resolution are properly managed and executed, the unity of Nigeria as a nation is assured and the drift towards anarchy and another civil war would come to an end.\n\nBriefly, the 12 resolutions contained the governors\u2019 observations (ii & iii), expression of concerns (ix, x, xii), recommendations (vi, vii & viii), declaration of support and gratitude for host governor (i & xii).\n\nConvocation of a National Dialogue/ Conference:\n\nI observed that the governors recommended that President Muhammadu Buhari should convene a National Conference/Dialogue as a matter of urgency.\n\nIt seems to me that the governors have overlooked the fact that President Buhari has long foreclosed the issue of the convocation of a National Conference/ Dialogue. This was confirmed in a statement by Mallam Shehu Garba, the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media & Publicity, at an interactive session with reporters, organized by the All Progressives Congress (APC) Professional Forum in Abuja, as published in The Guardian on May 14.\n\nFor ease of reference, I quote verbatim what was reported: \u201c(Garba) Shehu who foreclosed the convocation of a National Conference, called on the agitators to take their grievances to the National Assembly for amicable resolution\u201d.\n\nIn view of the declaration by the presidency, the governors\u2019 recommendation for a national conference/dialogue seems to have been met with a fait accompli. Any recommendation in that regard amounts to an exercise in futility.\n\nSummit of Hope:\n\nIn fact, I was aware of the pre-determined position of the presidency on national conference/dialogue. That was why in my address to the Bar at the end of the 10th Aare Afe Babalola Annual Public Lecture in my honour in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday, May 4, I suggested that the highly respected Ooni of Ife and the co-chair of all nigeria\u2019s traditional rulers, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, should accept my suggestion to reach out to distinguished and influential Nigerians throughout the country, including opinion leaders and opinion moulders of all former presidents of this country, the leadership of the National Assembly and states\u2019 assembly, traditional and religious leaders, trade unions, professional bodies and Civil Society Organizations to summon a \u201cSummit of Hope\u201d to discuss and suggest how to prevent the country from drifting into anarchy and civil war.\n\nI am surprised that the respected governors did not refer in their May 12 communique to the May 4, resolution which was enthusiastically accepted by the Ooni of Ife. Furthermore, the decision to hold the \u201cSummit of Hope\u201d was widely published in the media. Moreover, I had briefed the Ekiti State governor and the chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi, about the proposed \u201cSummit of Hope\u201d before the May 4, resolution.\n\nImplementation of the governors\u2019 resolutions\n\nAgain, I observed that the governors did not suggest the mode of implementation of any of the suggestions/ recommendations in the 12-point resolutions. Nigerians have been met with numerous ideas and suggestions without suggesting how to implement them thereby rendering such resolutions worthless. Ideas rule the world but only those who translate them into reality that change the world.\n\nI therefore make the following suggestions:\n\nThe governors should set up a committee of governors to deliberate on how to implement the lofty resolutions in their communique. The governors should hold either a physical of virtual meeting to discuss the implementation strategy of their resolutions. For instance, the governors should direct their respective Houses of Assembly to enact laws banning open grazing. Afterall, under the Land Use Decree, the land is vested in the governors. I recall that as a lawyer to the federal government in the N2.8 billion enquiry in 1980, instead of my professional fee of N5 million, I called on the federal government to approve a Federal University of Technology in Ado-Ekiti. And it was approved by the President Shehu Shagari Government. When the UPN governor in the bigger Ondo State then refused to give land for the University, the federal government transferred the University of Technology to Akure. On the crucially important issue of dialogue/conference, which the presidency had foreclosed, as a viable option, I urge the governors to support the \u201cSummit of Hope\u201d which was hailed by over 21 Obas and over 500 people present at the Bar Lecture on May 4. The highly respected Ooni of Ife openly accepted the offer and has undertaken to contact past presidents, past and present governors on the project. Arrangements are in progress by the implementation committee of the \u201cSummit of Hope\u201d to actualize the resolutions which has been commended by well-meaning Nigerians and non-Nigerians from Nigeria and outside Nigeria.\n\nI call on the governors to support this initiative to which I have committed the sum of N50 million in addition to my provision of venue, accommodation and feeding.",

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday, launched 300 mini busses tagged, the First and Last Mile Bus (FLM) Scheme as an alternative to commercial motorcycle popularly known as okada.\n\nThe new buses are expected to ply the inner routes in the six local government areas and nine local council development areas where okada have been banned. No fewer than 2,000 buses expected in the first phase of the project while total number of busses for the project is 5,000.\n\nThe governor, however, said the total ban on okada might not be enforced until another two months to give people enough time to get their cowry cards, gauge their response to the scheme, and also measure the scheme\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nAnother 100 High Capacity Buses were also unveiled by the governor. He described the initiatives as part of measures to address insecurity and provide Lagosians with safe, affordable and resilient commuting options.\n\nSanwo-Olu added that the initiatives were part of efforts to achieve a fully integrated inter-modal transport system.\n\nHe promised his administration was working to fulfil its campaign promises to the people. Commissioner for Transportation, Fredric Oladeinde, said the FLM launch was to reiterate the state\u2019s commitment to develop an integrated multi-modal transport system that is safe, comfortable, and support the people\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nManaging Director of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority, (LAMATA), Abimbola Akinajo, described the FLM scheme as part of the Bus Reform Initiative conceived to develop a coherent, formalised and regulated transport system and network in state.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe FLM is the last layer of the Bus Reform Initiative for Lagos State, which comes from the Lagos State Transport master plan developed by LAMATA. The Bus Reform Initiative is a plan by government to ensure that over time our public transportation system moves from an unregulated framework to a regulated framework.\u201d\n\nThe FLM scheme will be operated by private operators that will work with the state. The government will support them under a Bus Finance Scheme, where the private operator is expected to make a 20 percent down payment to be eligible to come under the scheme. The repayment period is for 36 months, with a 10 percent interest rate.",

The unlawful actions and reckless statements that define the NLC\u2019s assault on the rights of the people of Kaduna State, are a needless exercise in futility.\n\n\u2018Desperate actions undertaken by the NLC today include unlawful trespass on government facilities, and attempts to prevent officers from signing attendance registers.\n\n\u2018Despite these actions, the state government has guaranteed access to the State Secretariat and other government offices. KDSG intends to continue running its operations in the service to the people, despite the futile efforts of the NLC to impede it.\n\n\u2018The State Executive Council also held its regular weekly meeting to discuss policy matters germane to the progress of the state and the welfare of its people.\n\n\u2018In addition to shutting down electricity, the NLC has also shut healthcare access for several of our citizens. They have closed several hospitals and chased away the patients. General hospitals in Kawo, Tudun-Wada, Kafanchan, Giwa, Rigasa, Kakuri and Sabon Tasha were illegally locked. They also shut rural hospitals and primary health centres in Kwoi, Turunku and other locations across the state. Preventing patients from receiving treatment in public health facilities certainly does not qualify as a pro-people action.\n\n\u2018The State Government is documenting all these violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act. The government shares the pain of the people of Kaduna State amidst the avalanche of unlawful conduct by the NLC and appeals to all residents to remain calm and vigilant. The resort to coercion and the imposition of restraints on the personal freedom and comfort of citizens confirm that this is a campaign of sabotage, not an industrial action.\n\n\u2018KDSG welcomes the visit by the leaders of the Trade Union Congress who met with our Head of Service, Bariatu Y Mohammed, this morning. Hajiya Bariatu commended the constructive attitude of the TUC delegation led by Barrister Musa Lawal, its Secretary-General.

He will be prosecuted for economic sabotage,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that there is no ground for any compromise with the NLC, insisting that the labour union has used its last ultimate weapon and he will not change his position.\n\n\u201cThere is no grounds for compromise. They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything. We will not change our position,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nReacting, the NLC President, Wabba, said he is waiting for the governor to arrest him. Speaking while while leading a peaceful procession by workers on Tuesday in Kaduna, Wabba said the issue is not about him but about workers, adding that: \u201cWe are here and waiting for him to come and arrest us.

Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the PDP governors called on Buhari to immediately send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the constitution to devolve more powers to the states to enable governors to effectively manage security in their domains, especially through the establishment of a state policing system and developing their own internal security arrangements.\n\nThey said: \u201cIn the interim, Mr. President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr. President and all state governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that the police force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and recently by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to states; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the six-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors enjoined all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and other cleavages.\n\nTambuwal said the meeting called on the \u201cincompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\nHe added that the meeting reiterated the earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\n\nThe PDP governors thanked their host and colleague in Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmarks developmental projects he has executed.\n\nThey urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South-west to ensure that PDP takes over the majority of the states in the zone.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were Tambuwal; Governors Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State; Douye Diri of Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Seyi Makinde Oyo State; Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State; Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Mohammed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Our vaccination drive had started successfully and the number of daily cases being recorded were at an all-time low.\n\n\u201cAround the same time, many other countries in the world were facing an acute crisis and were in desperate need of help. Our government extended support wherever possible during this period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will not be safe till everyone globally is able to defeat this virus at a global scale. Further, as part of our global alliances, we also had commitments to COVAX, so that they could distribute the vaccines globally to end the pandemic.\n\n\u201cSII has delivered more than 200 million doses, even though we received EUA two months after the US pharma companies. If we look at total doses produced and delivered, we rank amongst the top three in the world. We continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritize India. We also hope to start delivering to COVAX and other countries by the end of this year.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nigeria has explored other options outside India, with 29 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine expected through the African Union.",

          "title": "Acumen\u2019s patient capital is providing investment alternatives for companies tackling poverty",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nIn 2017, Sanmi Lajuwomi identified a problem with the solar leasing space in Nigeria.\n\nOptimistic that it was worth further investigation, he pooled his personal funds and that of a high-net-worth individual in the UK, and undertook a two-year pilot study. At the end of the study, he had a better understanding of the customers and the challenges of running a business in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria in 2019.\n\nLajuwomi\u2019s company Winnock began by leasing solar equipment which could save small businesses up to 70% on electricity costs. The company has since added other productive use equipment such as sewing machines, fridges and freezers.\n\nIn 2019, they raised funds from some investors and got connected to Acumen. Impressed by what they saw, Acumen started a conversation with them.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty for the young startup of 10 people. Surprisingly, Lajuwomi got a call from Acumen, they hadn\u2019t concluded the due diligence process but in the light of recent happenings, they made him an offer of a $50,000 grant or convertible debt.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the loan was disbursed and Winnock was able to retain 100% of its staff without a salary reduction. Later in the year, Acumen invested in Winnock.\n\nAcumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. Its first appearance in Africa was in 2006 when its Kenyan office was set up, while its Lagos office was later created in 2012.\n\nOver the years, it has invested across West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and East African countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Collectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\n\nMy first contact with Acumen was through their Acumen Academy online courses. In July 2018, I took their Storytelling for Change course. For a long time, I had thought Acumen was an education company, and that was the starting point of my conversation with Meghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Why these courses?\n\nMeghan Curran: We started with a physical leadership development program, our West Africa fellows program. From that program, we started to think about how we could teach some of those skills to a broader audience so that people working on social change problems anywhere, could access these different pieces of content that would strengthen their work.\n\nThat\u2019s how the online courses came about. We started the online courses in 2012/2013 and to date have had more than 500,000 people participate in courses around the world in over 193 countries. The curriculum has expanded to include more courses asides leadership. The objective of these courses is to just help social entrepreneurs we may end up eventually investing in someday or generally help build other entrepreneurs who want to build their own skills.\n\nDA: Now that we\u2019re clear Acumen is not just an education company, What does Acumen do?\n\nMC: The original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. The best of both of those worlds is what we now call the patient capital approach. What that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\n\nOnce we make that investment, we\u2019re often doing equity deals and holding our position in a company for a number of years. When we exit our stake in the company that capital is returned to us. In a typical investment fund that returned capital would go back to the investors who had put money in and they would earn their returns.\n\nIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen and we redeploy it and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\n\nThe second thing that\u2019s really important is that we also have flexibility in terms of returns. Most investment funds have a specific return target that they\u2019re committed to achieving, because we\u2019re not returning capital to our investors, we\u2019re just trying to recover exactly what we put in. We have somewhat moderated return expectations, and this enables our entrepreneurs to really stay focused on the social objectives that they\u2019re trying to achieve without being forced, either to do something like pursue growth at all costs, and to hit exponential scale overnight.\n\nDA: How do you pick the companies you invest in?\n\nMC: Over the last couple of years in West Africa, we\u2019ve been focused primarily on renewable energy and agriculture. In both instances, we\u2019re looking for companies that have been operational anywhere from two to five years and have demonstrated a track record and revenue growth.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be profitable at the time we invest. In fact, most of them are not. There has to be a path to profitability where we can see where the break-even point is and where they will become profitable. I would say the thing that\u2019s consistent across any of the companies we look at is really wanting to get to know the entrepreneur. The assessment of the entrepreneur or the founding team is on two or three different levels. The first is values alignment. We\u2019re not trying to impose Acumen\u2019s mission or social objectives on an entrepreneur. We want to find entrepreneurs who, independent of Acumen, are interested in creating the same type of impact we want to see. Obviously, a significant percentage of their customer base has to be individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nThe second piece is the operational and technical capacity of the entrepreneur or the founding team. This means that they have done their homework on the industry or the sector that they\u2019re working in. It\u2019s sometimes reflected in the strength of the team that they have around them.\n\nDA: What are the sectors you\u2019re focused on?\n\nMC: The last couple of years we\u2019ve been really focused on renewable energy and agriculture. We\u2019re really starting to shift our impact definition to be inclusive of other sectors or business models.\n\nWe are asking ourselves how we look at transportation, waste management or light manufacturing, sectors that are often employing large numbers of low-income individuals and where they can make adjustments to their business models, to ensure that the jobs they\u2019re providing pay a living wage or create some kind of social safety net.\n\nDA: In your world of patient capital, How long does it take to do due diligence?\n\nMC: It really depends on how prepared the company is when we meet them and where they are in their stage of development. For our due diligence, It\u2019s just really about understanding the business model, understanding what their growth projections are and what some of those underlying assumptions are. That can take a month or two. Our more formal diligence where we\u2019re out doing these other interviews, conducting site visits, talking to customers, suppliers, other investors that you may have. Also doing our own kind of market research and market landscaping to make sure things all add up.\n\nThat can take another month or two. Once we get the investment approved there\u2019s documentation and that\u2019s where the lawyers come in and we\u2019re negotiating the details of the terms. From when we first meet you to when we make the investment, I would say six to nine months.\n\nMeghan Curran of Acumen Fund visit to PIND Foundation, Warri Office\n\nDA: What does a typical investment from you look like?\n\nMC: We do anything from $200,000 to $500,000 as the first investment.\n\nI would say there\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned along the way. When we started out, we didn\u2019t expect that if we could help these companies achieve scale, that there would be a long line of other investors waiting to follow us, but that there would be an availability of secondary capital that would enable us to exit. What we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s challenging for a couple of reasons. The markets we operate in are still in some ways underdeveloped such that most investors that are coming in, want to see their cash go to grow the company, not to buy existing investors.\n\nThe second piece is that we find that some of our entrepreneurs actually really value having Acumen as a board member to help protect that social objective. They sometimes don\u2019t want us to leave even when there\u2019s an opportunity. This is challenging and in a good way, but still challenging. What we\u2019ve started to do, with some of our more recent investments to address this, is to experiment with different investment instruments that enable us to have a clearer path to liquidity. In a recent investment we did in Sierra Leone, we actually structured it as a self-liquidating equity instrument where I think after a six or seven year period, the company has the opportunity to buy back shares from Acumen. In this way, the ownership stake eventually stays with the entrepreneurs and with the company, we have a path to some capital recovery, and yet in the short term, it\u2019s equity financing, that gives them the freedom and wiggle room to do what they need to do in the short to medium term.\n\nIn general, we end up holding our investments anywhere between seven to ten, sometimes up to 12 years, but we are trying to be creative about how we structure those investments to reduce, or to shorten that time horizon.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other \u2018traditional\u2019 investors considering the fact that there\u2019s only so much an impact fund can do?\n\nMC: I think we really see ourselves as a feeder to some of those more traditional investors. In the version of the world where everything goes according to plan, we\u2019re investing in some of these companies still at a relatively early stage. We\u2019re often the first institutional investor that they\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re able to accompany them to hit a certain growth trajectory or a certain level of maturity and scale, that\u2019s when they then become more attractive to some of those more commercial or traditional investors. We really see ourselves as helping build that pipeline of investments. What we see in West Africa is that there is a decent number of equity investors that are looking for investments where they want to put in a million or $3 million. Some even start at $5 million and there aren\u2019t that many companies that can absorb that type of capital.\n\nDA: How do companies find you or you find companies you invest in?\n\nMC: It\u2019s definitely a mix. We participate in the startup ecosystem. We go to different business plan competitions or industry events. We\u2019ve partnered with a couple of other earlier-stage investors to try to get to know and develop the pipeline.\n\nThrough our fellowship program and through our online courses as well. What we\u2019re really focused on in this coming year is continuing to push our footprint beyond Lagos and Abuja. We really want to go out to some of the other cities in Nigeria and be able to generate and develop a pipeline that\u2019s beyond the usual suspects.\n\nA session at The East Africa Acumen fellows program\n\nDA: What is a notable investment for you?\n\nMC: d.light which we first invested in 2007. The founders of that company from the beginning were really keen on developing a product or a suite of products that will be affordable for low-income consumers. They didn\u2019t develop the first solar panel but what they did was take a $20/25 product and push it down to be a $5 product. From there came solar home systems and now we\u2019re getting into solar appliances and not that they were the only company, but they were definitely one of the first movers and one of the early companies to really see low-income communities as a market.\n\nWe ended up making five different investments in delight over a 10 year period. We\u2019ve now partially exited and the company I think has served 80 million customers around the world. Not all of them in Africa, but a significant concentration. That\u2019s definitely one of our success stories.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging. The response to that has been some of these more creative financing instruments, whether it\u2019s doing revenue-based financing or these other self-liquidating instruments.\n\nAnother trend, which I think is a little more unfortunate is that the impact investing landscape has become pretty crowded with impact investors that are looking for market-ratemarket rate returns. At that point, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish the impact funds from the commercial funds. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself because I do think there are business models that have fewer trade-offs between impact and returns.\n\nDA: See trends in terms of sectors?\n\nMC: All of a sudden everyone is doing something that\u2019s agritech. Although there\u2019s a lot an app can do, there\u2019s also a lot more, particularly when you\u2019re working with small farmers, that is always going to be offline.\n\nWe look at agritech companies and we\u2019re really trying to evaluate what are their tech capabilities, as well as their offline capabilities? In some instances, offline is the harder part of the work. I think entrepreneurs need to have an awareness that tech should enable your solution, but it can\u2019t always be \u2013 it won\u2019t always be \u2013 the full solution.\n\nDA: Which Acumen courses would you recommend?\n\nMC: I would say the adaptive leadership course. Adaptive leadership is a framework to help think through problems that are complex with no known solution. On the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data. I think a lot of social entrepreneurs know in their head what they\u2019re trying to do in terms of the impact that they want to see, but being able to quantify it is a challenge.",
          "summary": "Acumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives.\nCollectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\nWhat that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging.\nOn the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data.",

          "text": "In March, Nigerian startup Termii raised $1.4 million in a seed round. Future Africa co-led the round with Kepple Africa Ventures, a Japanese Africa-focused venture capital firm.\n\nIt is not clear how much Future Africa invested in Termii but the firm can invest up to $500,000 in deals, thanks to the Future Africa Collective, its community of angel investors.\n\nIt turns out Future Africa has done a dozen other deals since. Other investments this year have been in Kenyan startups Lami and Ongair, as well as in Stitch, a South African company building APIs for open banking.\n\nThe firm says it has invested $3 million in 13 startups in the first five months of 2021. By doing so, they have doubled their 2020 performance in dollar terms.\n\nFuture Africa invested $1.2 million in 14 startups in 2020. They returned $3.7 million to some of the firm\u2019s first limited partners after profitably exiting some legacy positions through secondaries.\n\nFuture Africa has now made 47 investments as a fund. Launched in 2020, the firm operates an institutional venture capital fund (\u201cFuture Africa Fund\u201d) and a subscription-based syndicate composed of Africa-focused angel investors (\u201cFuture Africa Collective\u201d).\n\nMembers of the Future Africa Collective pay $1,000 annually for the opportunity to invest a minimum of $5,000 per deal. Future Africa Fund alone invests a maximum of $50,000 per deal.\n\nOlabinjo Adeniran, a Future Africa co-founder, said members of the Future Africa Collective will have access to 20 deals in 2021. These 20 will be part of 100 startup investments that the Future Africa Fund plans to make this year.\n\nSeen in that light, it looks like Future Africa is behind schedule with 13 investments after four months. Adeniran confirms that not all 13 investments have been offered to members of the Collective, so the firm is also behind on the 20-startup target.\n\nBut \u201cwe think we are going to exceed the target number on both ends,\u201d Adeniran says to TechCabal.\n\nFuture Africa chose not to disclose the 9 other investments it has made because the startups have not announced the funding. But they did drop a few hints:\n\nTwo digital banks: one for financial organisations transacting between Africa and the UK; the other for African migrants.\n\n\u201cA pharmaceutical startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to solve the drug counterfeiting problem in Africa\u201d\n\nA startup that \u201chelps businesses create flexible virtual and physical cards for multiple purposes\u201d which might be Sudo (Adeniran declined to confirm or deny).\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s initial investments were centered around Nigerian startups like 54Gene, Bamboo and Eden, but the firm is taking a more pan-African outlook. Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are now represented on the firm\u2019s portfolio map.\n\nBeyond the appeal of building a pan-African suite of investments, Future Africa hopes to fund more women-led startups. At the beginning of the year, the firm set out to invest $1 million in women-led startups.\n\nIt appears Future Africa has met that milestone, though no details are provided about the women-led startups. We know Lami, one of the new investments, is co-founded and led by a woman \u2013 Jihan Abass.\n\nFuture Africa plans to fund more women-led startups, pushing past the initial $1 million goal.\n\n\u201cWe are going to announce some new structures soon that will enable us move even faster and invest in more startups,\u201d Adeniran says. \u201cIt should be ready within the next 3 months.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside Klasha\u2019s mission to help 5,000 global retailers sell and ship to Africa",
          "text": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the first week of May, the eve of Klasha\u2019s public launch. Jessica Anuna is showing me a demo of a customer adding items to a cart in an online store, filling in billing details and paying through Klasha.\n\nA few seconds later, her phone beeps with an email notification that her demo order has been placed, with a receipt attached for proof.\n\nAnuna exudes the relief and excitement of a founder and CEO who has built an e-commerce payments product from scratch after nearly three years. Klasha is her solution for global merchants looking to serve Africa\u2019s increasingly digitally native consumers.\n\n\u201cWith Klasha, merchants would not have to open individual country stores. They can now make their existing global e-commerce stores Africa friendly,\u201d Anuna says.\n\nThe business case\n\nOpening individual country stores is a secondary headache. For merchants who want to sell in Africa, the first problem is setting up country-by-country payment connections.\n\nTo do this well, these merchants have to be present on the ground and do some dreary work, like managing currency conversions themselves.\n\nKlasha Checkout essentially absorbs all of that responsibility into one payment gateway. Hear Anuna explain how Klasha manages exchange rate fluctuations:\n\n\u201cAt the time the customer pays for the item, the exchange rate is locked in. That way, we are able to remit the equivalent value to the merchant. In the merchant\u2019s dashboard, they can opt to pay themselves out at different exchange rates.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to payments, Klasha\u2019s e-commerce feature includes a logistics service. This service is built to convince high-growth brands, doing above $20 million in gross merchandise value, that Africa is a destination to take seriously.\n\nHer pitch is that when a merchant sets up a Klasha Checkout option on their website, Africans will more readily purchase items in their local currencies. Ghanaians pay with mobile money. Kenyans pay with M-Pesa. Nigerians can pay with Naira bank cards.\n\nBundling logistics and payments\n\nAt the moment, Anuna says they have retailers from the US, UK, the Middle East, and some conversations are ongoing with retailers in Japan. Their focus is on retailers selling fast-moving consumer goods that are not perishable \u2013 clothes, shoes, bags and electronics.\n\nKlasha will make revenue by taking commissions on sales and offering subscriptions to merchants, especially for add-ons like analytics. In exchange, the startup helps merchants collect payments from and ship directly to African buyers\u2019 doorsteps in no more than 9 working days.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous promise, especially the logistics aspect. Klasha is primarily a payments company. To fulfil deliveries, they will be partnering with two different logistics companies; the first brings the merchant\u2019s goods into Africa while the second delivers to the customer\u2019s door. In Nigeria, Anuna says they are ready to deliver to every local government area.\n\nWhy is a young startup burdening itself with this complexity, knowing how poor road infrastructure in Nigeria hampers efficient logistics?\n\nAlthough she held back details of Klasha\u2019s logistics, Anuna is confident that the company can deliver on a dependable model, which won\u2019t make consumers pay higher prices than other payments and shipping options.\n\nShe\u2019s relying on her experience at Amazon, Net-a-Porter and Shopify, plus four years in China running a logistics business.\n\nJessica Anuna, founder and CEO of Klasha. Image credit: Klasha\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t built Klasha alone. A glass wall separates the room where we meet from an adjacent room where her developers are having a chat, their laptops displaying several lines of code in pink and other colours.\n\nThe sales team, led by Fumi Aoki, is in another room crouched over computers. Aoki joined recently from Senri, a sales automation startup. Other members of the 11-person Klasha team have Nigerian startup experience from places like OPay, Andela and Boomplay.\n\nShooting for 5,000 Klasha merchants\n\nI wonder if Klasha can go on to integrate emerging fintech offerings \u2013 like Buy Now Pay Later. Anuna says her team has discussed it, but it is not on their short-term roadmap.\n\nAt the same time, she tries to sell me on the Klasha mobile app. The app enables users to generate virtual cards & shop on online stores regardless of whether the store has Klasha Checkout or not.\n\nKlasha\u2019s virtual card carries VISA\u2019s emblem and allows users to spend beyond the $100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The other distinct feature of the mobile app is sending money to peers using Twitter-like handles, which reminds me of Abeg, the peer-to-peer payments startup owned by Piggyvest.\n\nKlasha is in the virtual cards business. Goodbye $100 limits?\n\nAfter an hour-long conversation, I leave Anuna and her team to continue launch preparations. At least one influencer was drafted for publicity on D-Day; to drive app downloads.\n\nBut that will not be the metric to assess Klasha in three, six, or nine months. Instead, look out for how many major online stores and marketplaces Anuna has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have 5,000 merchants by Q1 2022,\u201d she says.\n\nHow many do they have right now? \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but we are on track.\u201d",

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users. Fundall\u2019s dollar virtual cards aims to eliminate the challenge of spending limits Nigerians come across when making international payments using naira cards. The USD-denominated debit card is a limitless passport to the world as users are able to enjoy freedom and flexibility when making payments in dollars anywhere in the world.\n\nWith a Fundall virtual dollar card, users can spend internationally and transact on any website seamlessly as well as enjoy the convenience, flexibility, safety, and security of cashless payments across various channels \u2013 whether for shopping online on Shopify or Amazon, paying for streaming access on Netflix, or business services like Facebook Ads.\n\nFundall users will be able to get their first virtual dollar card for free, while the creation fee for subsequent card creation is just $2. Users are also able to create multiple cards instantly and can easily dedicate each card to one web platform.\n\nFundall \u2013 run by a company of the same name founded in 2019 \u2013 is on a mission to provide all things money in one place to their customers. Fundall users can manage everything money-related on its online platform; and unlike most banking services providers that only focus on the money of their clients, Fundall does more to help its growing user base. There are currently 17,000 individuals and 150 businesses registered on Fundall\u2019s online platform right now.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foremost financial super app offers a wide range of services that include flexible payments and transfers, savings plans, in addition to advanced tools for better money management such as lifestyle cards, budget planning, income and spending analytics, SaveAsYou Spend, Portfolio Line of Credit, and insurance.

A savings tool and wealth builder aimed towards specific goals are included.

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Homzmart, an Egyptian-based marketplace startup, has secured $15 million in its Series A investment round, TechCrunch reports.\n\nIn February 2020, the startup\u2019s $1.3 million seed round was reported by Menabytes as one of the largest by an Egyptian startup. It, once again, surpasses previous records as it has now successfully closed the largest financing round in its sector in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nThe company was founded in 2019 by Mahmoud Ibrahim, former COO of Daraz \u2014 an online marketplace and logistics company that operates in South Asia and Southeast Asia \u2014 and Ibrahim Mohamed, former Head of Logistics at Jumia. Still, it didn\u2019t launch until the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis round of financing is co-led by China\u2019s MSA Capital \u2014 one of the investors in Homzmart\u2019s seed round in February 2020, alongside Nuwa Capital. Other participants include Rise Capital, Impact 46, EQ2 Ventures, and Outliers Venture Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomzmart claims the Egyptian furniture market is historically characterised by poor customer accessibility and high distribution costs for retailers.\n\nThe startup\u2019s business model, which involves collecting designs, price ranges, and other details of its retailers\u2019 products, handles high distribution costs for them by providing access to consumers \u2014 homeowners and professionals \u2014 who have flexible financing options.\n\nIt creates a one-stop-shop, hassle-free experience for consumers who are easily connected to retailers such as IKEA and Home Centre.\n\nHomzmart\u2019s platform incorporates artificial intelligence to optimise furniture sellers\u2019 content, with intelligent tools helping customers with purchasing decisions.\n\nAs Ibrahim said during the company\u2019s seed round, \u201cThere are 25 million people in the Middle East and North Africa region searching for home furnishing every month with no serious player serving them online.\u201d\n\nLaunched at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ibrahim expressed uncertainty about the company\u2019s survival due to anticipated behavioural changes in consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the reverse was the case as consumers seemed to like the product, resulting in more sales, as witnessed in most eCommerce and marketplaces during the height of the pandemic.\n\nMSA Capital\u2019s General Partner, Ben Harburg, cites this as one of the reasons the company joined in financing the startup again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the extreme vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of the Middle East\u2019s archaic offline retail ecosystem, logistics, and supply chain.\n\n\u201cInto the void stepped Homzmart as the next generation, digitally-enabled online marketplace and optimised logistics provider for large-item retail addressing both consumer and enterprise customers.\u201d\n\nHomzmart\u2019s founders\u2019 vast experience was another reason behind the firm\u2019s decision.\n\nHaving spent its first year in business understanding supply and demand, it now looks to scale its business model, expanding its reach across the region.\n\n\u201cWhatever we did in Egypt, we need to do across the region. Homzmart isn\u2019t looking to be just an Egyptian platform, rather a regional platform,\u201d said Ibrahim.\n\nIn keeping with this, Homzmart has strategically established operations close to Damietta City. Known as the region\u2019s largest manufacturing hub, Damietta would allow the company to streamline MENA\u2019s vertical industry supply chain.\n\nHomzmart currently showcases over 55,000 products from thousands of brands and merchants and claims to have 30x growth in sales. The online marketplace is tapping into the rapidly expanding $8 billion industry where 14 million customers in the region search online for furniture monthly.\n\nAs TechCrunch reports, Ibrahim says the company hopes to make sure it is building the right institutional infrastructure for its business and to ensure that after two or three years, it is building a very solid, multi-billion dollar business.\n\nPhotocredit: TechCrunch\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nCome learn strategies on how to get funding, grow your network and position your startup business for profit.

          "text": "East-Africa-based telecommunications company, Safaricom, ended its business year on March 31, 2021. The telecom giant marked 20 years of servicing the African market and released its financial report on Thursday, May 13, 2021.\n\nAs with many other businesses, the first half of the fiscal year was difficult for the company because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite a subdued financial performance, the company had some solid wins.\n\nLike the previous financial year, revenue from voice and messaging declined, with Internet data experiencing a revenue boost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMessaging revenue went from KSh 15,193.8 million (~$141,619) to KSh 13,602.4 million (~$126,787), which was an 11.7% drop. The Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for their monthly active messaging customers reduced from KSh 60.77 to Ksh52.7.\n\nFor voice services, revenue fell by 4.6%, with a decline from KSh 86,349.4 million ($804,826) to KSh 82,55.0 million ($769,473). The ARPU for active monthly voice customers went from KSh 287.16 to KSh 257.72.\n\nInternet revenue took an impressive leap from KSh 39,641.9 million ($369,513) to KSh 44,793.2 million ($417,554). With a year-on-year increase of 11.5%. This has been the trend as other telecom giants in Africa recorded revenue boosts in Internet data in recent financial reports.\n\nM-Pesa gets shaky\n\nIn this fiscal year, the company\u2019s mobile money platform, M-Pesa, experienced a slight dive.\n\nIn what happens to be the first of its kind, revenue dropped by 2.1% in the first half of the financial year, falling from KSh 84,382 billion ($786, 545,581) to KSh 82,647 billion ($770,410,517).\n\nThis could be because of fees waived on person-to-person (P2P), Bank to M-Pesa wallet (B2C), and M-Pesa to bank wallet (C2B) transactions of KSh 1,000 ($9.32) and below.\n\nThe waiver was to curtail the rapid spread of COVID-19. When the waiver ended in January 2021, P2P transaction charges were reduced by 45% for low-value transaction bands below KSh 7,500 ($69.91), while B2C and C2B transactions remained free.\n\nHowever, M-Pesa recovered significantly. Total M-Pesa transaction value grew by 58.2% YoY to KSh 22.4 trillion ($208.8 billion).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volume of transactions grew by 29.8% to eleven point six billion. Currently, M-Pesa accounts for 33.0% of Safaricom\u2019s service revenue.\n\nPlans for the new year include setting up 5G trials across more Kenyan cities. The report also reveals plans to launch an M-Pesa mobile application by the second half of the new fiscal year.\n\nFurthermore, Safaricom used the report to publicise its plans to integrate with Amazon. If this integration happens, M-Pesa users will be able to pay for goods with their mobile wallets on the eCommerce platform.\n\nImage credit ajleon on Wunderstock\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

Therefore, off-take remains low even where supply is high due to affordability issues.\n\nIt has been observed that the only true mortgage available in Nigeria remains the federal mortgage bank of Nigeria\u2019s (FMBN) NHF which gives beneficiaries longer tenure at an interest rate of between 6-8 per cent at the value of N5 \u2013 N15million. And this is what Mutual Alliance\u2019s fund is out to facilitate.\n\nAccording to Okon Amasi, MAMB\u2019s managing director, mortgage-backed by money market is expensive, assuring that MAMR would reduce the cost of housing in Nigeria. \u201cIt is the beginning of capital market taking over mortgage from the money market,\u201d he noted.\n\nFor investors, this facility comes with good returns. \u201cReturns on investment will be interest and dividend payments. Interest should be 12 per cent yearly. Interest for year one will be lump sum and paid at the end of the year while semi-yearly payments of interest will commence first half of the year two and every half year through the tenor of the fund,\u201d Amasi assured.\n\nThe fund comes with a number of benefits for various stakeholders. To workers in government parastatals, particularly, it is a unique investment opportunity to access lump sum for equity contribution for a mortgage loan, leading to owning a home.\n\nIt also gives an average civil servant access to a decent and affordable house which translates to the realization of the dream to become homeowners.\n\nThe government also benefits from the fund as it minimises the housing deficit, thereby solving one of the country\u2019s socio-economic problems. The fund is expected to deepen the financial market and also limit employment-related migration from point A to point B.\n\nIn addition to the unique investment opportunity it offers, the fund also leads to portfolio diversification to unit-holders and enables them to earn consistent returns, represented by the interest payment.\n\nThe hybrid fund promises to assure a 12 percent return on investment. At a time when returns on investment assets, including the federal government Treasury Bill, is at their lowest, a 12-percent, analysts say that return on this offer is a good yield.",

API banking refers to a system that makes a bank\u2019s services available to other third-party companies via APIs. API Banking helps both banks and third-party companies augment their complementary specialties and offerings more than they can provide to their customers by themselves.\n\nThrough its API, Polaris Bank is reported to have so far on-boarded new business start-ups, improved their market access, and ensured profit sharing with partners within the financial technology space.

Immediately you correct your documentation the six weeks start.\n\n\u201cWhen you apply you wait for six weeks and you will get your passport. If you don\u2019t get it, hold us responsible.\n\n\u201cIf any passport officer fails to contact an applicant and the passport is not issued after the stipulated time, disciplinary measures will be taken against that officer.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the recent halt in new applications for passports, the Comptroller-General said, \u201cAll passport applications all over the country are hereby closed between May 18 and May 31, 2021.\u201d\n\nThis suspension of receiving and processing of fresh passport applications, he said, was to allow for clearance of all applications that were received before May 17, 2021, adding that a Task Force supervised by ACGs, will be sent to Passport offices to clear the backlog.\n\nBabandede said, \u201cSo, there will be no operations at the passport office from today until May 31. We will use this period to clear the backlogs of passports yet unissued.\n\n\u201cDeputy comptrollers-general have been assigned to take direct charge of some selected passport policies.

Payments from June 1, 2021, will be purely online.\n\n\u201cI have assigned the Provost Marshall to ensure that no cash is paid to the passport office. That office will be used for production only.\n\n\u201cWe used the Sallah holidays to do a lot of work. No passport officer went on holiday. We have sent text messages to Nigerians whose passports are ready.\n\nOn the re-issuance of passports, Babandede added, \u201cApplicants can come for the re-issuance of their passports from June 1, 2021; six months before their passport validity elapses.\n\n\u201cThis means that as soon as your passport has reached six months before it expires, you have the right to come for another one.\n\n\u201cWe have improved it from three months to six months.

          "text": "Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger has confirmed that three soldiers had been killed in a gun battle with armed bandits in Magama, Magama Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor made the disclosure on Tuesday shortly after a meeting with security chiefs at Government House in Minna. Bello told newsmen that the military recorded the casualties as it lost three soldiers in the battle that lasted for over one hour.\n\n\u201cTwo bodies of bandits killed during the fight in the area were also recovered on Monday, while the bandits managed to escape with the rest.\n\nThe governor described the latest onslaught on the state, especially against the military, as unfortunate. He said that soldiers and a group of armed bandits on Monday night engaged each other in a gun battle leading to the death of three soldiers. He. however, said that the bandits were being trailed by the Army and assured that they would be arrested soonest. Gov. Bello disclosed that in spite of the banditry activities in the state, normalcy is gradually returning to some of the communities recently sacked by the bandits. \u201cNo fewer than 50 communities have been resettled back in the villages. \u201cThey were led back to their villages by the armed soldiers,\u201d he said.

          "title": "Post COVID-19: What Nigeria, France must do to strengthen military, economic ties",
          "text": "By Muhammadu Buhari\n\nToday, leaders from across Africa meet in Paris to discuss plans to recover from the impact of a common enemy \u2013 COVID-19. But for African nations from across the Sahel region and beyond, the issues are inseparable from the fight against another common enemy which is terrorism. And like the war against the Coronavirus, it is one we are fully united with France in our strong determination to overcome.\n\nAcross the world, conflict and Coronavirus have not been far apart. As governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa. Terrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.\n\nWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon. It has demonstrated why pushing against one front can prove futile if groups can simply migrate to ponds of insecurity across porous borders. Yet as instability has spread, so the networks that sustain it have strengthened \u2013 whether that be weapons supply chains from Libya, ideological imports of Al-Qaeda and ISIS from the Middle East, or trafficking networks that take money from those escaping instability and feeds it back into the system that generates it.\n\nMeanwhile the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets. In that context, our fate is linked. Hence Paris has been active in this common fight. The French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\nNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperations if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\nIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\nHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\n\nIn the Sahel, crises converge. Traditionally, this vast arid land has been poorer than its Mediterranean neighbours to the north and fertile land to its South. Now, climate change and environmental degradation squeeze the region of water sources, draining opportunity and increasing competition amongst various groups for scarce resources. The fallout from Libya has flushed the whole region with weapons, making any disputes and competition far more destructive. And it is upon these conditions, the lies and propaganda of terrorists who falsely claim to be Islamists promising salvation can find an audience. Islam is a religion of peace.\n\nTo counteract these, we must focus on initiatives that sustainably spread opportunity far and wide across the Sahel. Transport links across the Sahel have become dilapidated, much of it still the remnants of the colonial era. For the region\u2019s burgeoning young population, reinvigorating these links or building anew is critical. It allows for efficient allocation of labour; the movement of inputs such as seed, fertiliser or equipment to the areas that need it; and freight to take produce or extractives to market or value-add factories.\n\nNow, as the world emerges from the pandemic, we have the chance to build back better. Though we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with that idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for both of us.",

          "title": "Fresh twists as workers\u2019 protest thickens in Kaduna",
          "text": "The industrial action that has grounded Kaduna state may be far from being over as Governor Nasir el-Rufai ordered the sack of nurses below Grade Level 14 and Kaduna State University (KASU) lecturers who joined the strike.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai also declared the labour leaders as bandits, describing their actions as equivalent of banditry, kidnapping and other security challenges facing the state.\n\nHe also declared wanted NLC President Ayuba Wabba and some leaders of the group for breach of public peace and related offences.\n\nMr. Wabba, the body\u2019s acting general secretary, Comrade Bende Ismail, Vice Presidents, Najeem Yasin and Amaechi Asigiri and Comrade Joe Ajaero among other NLC top guns, led the peaceful protest from its state secretariat to Kaduna state House of Assembly Monday where Wabba gave a speech on why they shutdown Kaduna.\n\nThe decision followed the commencement of NLC\u2019s five-day warning strike and protest that shut down economic and social activities in Kaduna state Monday, literally grounding the state to a halt with the airport, train station, banks, government offices, institutions, filling stations and electricity all shut down.\n\nSpeaking in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, Governor el-Rufai lamented that some nurses engaged in sabotage of some health facilities to join the strike, adding that many nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\nThe governor singled out three nurses of Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, who he said the state would prosecute for allegedly disconnecting the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai said the health ministry had been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed, warning that any academic staff of Kaduna State University (KASU) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not tolerate criminal acts disguised as industrial action. Today, the Kaduna state government reviewed the sundry criminal actions that have defined the campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness waged by the NLC.\n\n\u201cKDSG considers as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days. The state government commends citizens for remaining calm amidst this assault on their rights and comfort and their businesses.\n\n\u201cHowever, KDSG cannot be expected to tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients, unlawful trespass into public facilities and the wanton use of coercion and restraints of personal freedom by the NLC.\n\n\u201cAlso, KDSG cannot ignore the illegal pressures brought to disrupt the operations of banks and other private businesses whose staff and customers do not have any industrial dispute with the state or any other government. KDSG regrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities. Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\n\u201cReports from Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disclosed that some identified nurses disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday, 17th May 2021. The names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby.\n\n\u201cIn addition, KDSG has decided the following: Ayuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC are declared wanted, and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna state, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts. They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike. Salaries that could have gone to them are to be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty. The Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed;\n\n\u201cAny academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed. The authorities of KASU are to submit a copy of the attendance register for all categories of staff daily to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education. All MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service;\n\n\u201cKDSG views the actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens. Bandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends: trying to hold hostage the freedoms, economic interests, livelihoods and resources of the people of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not submit its treasury to the entitled minority. We will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna state even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum. The government remains committed to providing social services beyond paying salaries, always putting the interests of the many ahead of the few,\u201d el-Rufai said.\n\nFurther to that, the governor promised handsome reward for anybody who knows the whereabouts of Wabba and other NLC leaders declared wanted.\n\nEl-Rufai who posted the declaration Tuesday on his verified Twitter handle @elrufai, said the labour leaders were wanted for economic sabotage and attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act.\n\nThe governor\u2019s tweet Tuesday morning read: \u201cKADUNA UPDATE: Ayuba Wabba & others of @NLCHeadquarters declared wanted for economic sabotage & attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act. Anyone that knows where he is hiding should send a message to @MOJKaduna. KDSG. There will be a handsome reward!\u201d\n\nArmed thugs attack workers\n\nMeanwhile, a group of thugs suspected to be sponsored by the state government Tuesday attacked labour leaders and workers during the peaceful protest.\n\nThe attacked happened shortly after the governor left the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), adjacent where the workers assembled, with heavily armed security personnel to forcefully install power installation.\n\nThe armed thugs came in a bus brought series of weapons like stick, bottles, stones and machetes.\n\nThe thugs were however overpowered by both workers and security personnel at the venue of the protest.\n\nBlueprint can also report that some of the security personnel who were seen in groups discussing, said the government was planning to declare curfew in the state.\n\nThey described the action as \u201cuncivilised and barbaric \u201c, stressing that the workers were peaceful and orderly which should be commended.\n\nSome workers who tried to confront the thugs while throwing stones were stopped by the labour leaders, while the detachment of security men, police , civil defence, military men, and the Road Safety, who were on ground approached the thugs and tried to persuade and appeal to them.\n\nThe defiant thugs, despite the appeal by security personnel, started throwing stones, and attempt to disperse them with teargas was initially unsuccessful as their actions disrupted the rally before the thugs were finally dispersed by the workers themselves, without any casualty.\n\nWhen the situation was brought under control, Comrade Wabba briefly addressed the workers to end the rally with a promise to use all labour actions available to confront the state government.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the NLC president said the congress was fully aware of the plan by the state governor to unleash thugs on them, and had as early as Tuesday morning shared the information and the clips of the plan with all the security agencies.\n\nHe pointed out that the military, SSS, Police, Civil Defence were all notified earlier and were aware of the plans, alleging the governor himself led the thugs.\n\n\u201cWe said it in the morning. We mentioned the name of the person that was contracted. We mentioned the thugs that will be coming and I told all the security agencies, I called the DSS, I called the police, I told them that this is the credible information we have. We have the clips. This clip was trending since 6 am in the morning.\n\n\u201cThey had the meeting in the night and we shared our intelligence with the Police and the DSS. We were fully aware and that was why we informed the security agencies because it is the role of the security agencies to provide security cover for any protest.\n\n\u201cAnd you saw, he was the person that led the thugs because he came and entered NEPA office (Kaduna Electric) before the thugs came. Our workers wanted to go but we said no. He led them before they came and tried to unleash mayhem, but we thank God that our people were also good in number and they were chased away,\u201d he said.\n\nPower sector under threat\n\nBut the workers had threatened to escalate the power outage nationwide by Friday, if governors failed to advise El-Rufai to dialogue with the workers.\n\nSpeaking, a Deputy President of NLC and General Secretary of Nigeria Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), Comrade Ajaero, said the power blackout would go national from Friday, if the situation remains the same and El-Rufai refused to do the needful.\n\n\u201cThe NLC had warned earlier that if after the five-day warning strike, the state governor failed to address the issues, workers across the country would join in solidarity and commence a nationwide strike.\n\n\u201cThey said we are declared wanted and we are in the streets of Kaduna. Let me make this clear, there is decision of power \u2013 the executive, the judiciary and the legislator.\n\n\u201cNo Executive governor can declare anybody wanted. The police can do that, the courts can give order. Any executive Governor that is announcing that doesn\u2019t know his job, there is separation of powers between the three arms of Government so in furtherance to the illegality being perpetrated by El-Rufai , is the power of the police and the court to declare someone wanted .\n\n\u201cNow, El-Rufai is an illegal governor all his actions and pronouncements are embedded in illegality so we are here the action is on, the strike is on. Rather than go into issue of negotiation, he has resulted to harassment and intimidation. Last night he tried to use force to enter power installation to install power. Let me say this under the Constitution- Sections 1&2 made it clear the supremacy of the constitution.\n\nSection 40 gives us freedom movement, freedom of association as well as freedom to protest and we are not going to violate any law.\n\n\u201cWe are going to perform our trade union function to the best of our knowledge. And for your information, power is under the exclusive list; el Rufai has no business to say anything about power. The state government is under concurrent list. So, everyone should mind his powers. Comrades, I want to urge all of you to stay firm. So, for some of us in the power sector, if by tomorrow or next nothing happens, we are ready to escalate it to the whole country, we want to send a message to the chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) that if they don\u2019t advise El-Rufai on this issue, they would feel also the power outage.\u201d\n\nThe peaceful rally which commenced as usual from the NLC state secretariat where the workers were earlier addressed by the NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, and passed through the secretariat through to the popular NEPA Junction along Ahmadu Bello Way, before the thugs arrived in two small buses, jumped down with sticks to confront the Labour leaders.\n\nBlueprint reports that as a t the time of this report, the Kaduna metropolis still remained deserted with all businesses under lock and key.\n\nAPC govs beg\n\nAnd from the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) came a plea that Governor El-Rufai should negotiate with the striking workers.\n\nChairman of the forum and governor of Kebbi state, Abubakar Bagudu, made the plea in a statement Tuesday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe PGF has been following unfolding development between NLC and Kaduna State government over the issue of rightsizing local government employees with deep concerns.\n\n\u201cNoting all the challenges facing all our states, especially given dwindling revenue, we appeal to all patriotic Nigerians, including the NLC, to demonstrate more commitment toward engaging governments at all levels to address problems.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for muscle-flexing,\u201d Mr Bagudu said, saying Nigerians were already overstretched with many challenges.\n\n\u201cAt this critical point of our democratic journey, there could not be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens.\u201d\n\nHe said that every step must be taken to resolve the face-off between the state government and NLC.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to NLC leadership to recognise that the burden of leadership is more about responding to challenges based on the honest disposition of correcting past mistakes.\n\n\u201cAs progressive governors, we share the vision of Kaduna State government of reforming all our local government councils to make them more efficient and consequently the pivot of critical development initiatives.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we want to appeal to the state government under the leadership of our colleague, Malam Nasir El-Rufai to take all necessary steps to ensure the resolution of all disagreements in the larger interest of citizens in Kaduna state,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bagudu expressed confidence that both the state government and NLC would resolve all outstanding issues and restore industrial harmony in the state.\n\nNAN\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "2021 budget deficit: Buhari seeks NASS\u2019 nod to raise N2.343trn loan",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded to the National Assembly a request for an approval to raise the sum of N2, 343,387,942,848 trillion from multilateral and bilateral lenders, to finance the deficit of N5.602 trillion in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe amount which is equivalent to USD$6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD$1/N379, is captured as part of the N4.666 trillion External Borrowing plans proposed and approved through the passage of the N13.8 trillion 2021 budget.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter addressed to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker House of Representatives, and read during plenary.\n\nAccording to the president, the request was made in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment) Act, 2003.\n\nHe disclosed that Nigeria may be able to raise USD$3 billion or more in a combination of tenors between 5-30 years.\n\nBuhari explained that the federal government\u2019s decision to raise the sum from the International Capital Market was due to the recent monetary policy stance that provides for very low interest rates and ease of moderating debt service cost.\n\nHe further disclosed that the proceeds of the USD6.183 billion (N2.343 trillion New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act) would be used to fund specific Capital Projects in the Budget.\n\nThe president said such projects were captured in priority sectors of the economy, namely: Power, Transportation, Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Health, Provision of Counterpart Funding for Multilateral and Bilateral projects, Defence and Water Resources.\n\nThe letter reads : \u201cRequest For the Resolution of the National Assembly For: The Implementation of the New External Borrowing of N2.343 trillion (about USD6.183 Billion) In the 2022 Appropriation Act\u201d, reads in part:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this Letter is to request for a Resolution of the National Assembly (NASS) to raise the sum of N2, 343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) provided as New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the Budget Deficit of N5.602 trillion.\n\n\u201cThis request is in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act). Section 21(1) of the DMO states that \u201cno external loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its Resolution\u201d; while Section 27(1) states that the National Assembly may by a resolution approve, from time to time, standard terms and conditions for the negotiation and acceptance of external loans and issuance of guarantees.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as New Borrowings(Item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 Fiscal Deficit, of Which 50% or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) is specified as New External Borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may also wish to note that the allocation of #2.343 trillion to New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with the Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and to free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers\u201d\n\nThe President in another letter to the Senate, requested for concurrent approval of donor-funded projects under the 2018 \u2013 2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan.\n\nIn the letter, President Buhari further explained that the projects listed under the 2018 \u2013 2020 External Borrowing Plan, are to be financed through Sovereign loans from the World Bank , African Development Bank (AfDB) , French Development Agency ( AFD) , Islamic Development Bank , China EXIMBank etc , at a total sum of $36.837billion and 910, 000,000million Euro.\n\n\u2018Request ill-timed\u2019\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions to the president\u2019s decision were divergent, with some saying it\u2019s ill-timed while others said it was in order.\n\nFor Managing Director/CEO SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade, the federal government\u2019s request for additional borrowing of $6.18 billion to finance the 2021 budget deficit is not healthy for the economy at the moment \u201ctaking into cognisance the difficulty we are experiencing in loan repayments due to reductions in revenue accruing to the Federation account.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with one of our correspondents, Gbolade noted that the \u201ccycle of borrowing will further sink the country in more debt with no clear cut strategy effective enough to service loan repayments.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s borrowing to fund infrastructural projects should have been designed in a way that the projects funded will repay the loans which is not the case, leaving us with dwindling revenues from oil and non-oil sectors to fund loan repayments with other government obligations.\n\n\u201cThe request by the president is ill timed as further borrowings will have a strain on our capacity to meet up with expectations of the people and will further add more economic hardship in the long run.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s in order but\u2026\u2019\n\nIn his view, a public affairs commentator, Engr. Godwin Ubochi, the president\u2019s request is in order.\n\nAccording to him, the spending plan of the president at last year\u2019s budget presentation before the National Assembly was an indication that Nigeria would borrow to fund its budget.\n\nHe said: \u201cI maintain that there is nothing wrong in borrowing for capital projects that are self- liquidating. My worry is that Nigeria borrowed so much in the past without anything to show for it. Corruption in government, lack of transparency and accountability, inefficiency, incompetence and lack of capacity in governance and financial prudence are Nigeria\u2019s undoing in loan management. The management of this loan is not expected to be any different because nothing has changed in our government system. If anything, corruption level is much higher.\n\n\u201cWith a shortfall in government revenue in the midst of a pandemic, it will be difficult to carry on without loan, which should be the last resort after the government has done the needful from within. There is a lot of stealing and wastage in government. Until this is taken care of, further borrowing will lead to a deeper economic crisis.\u201d\n\nAlso a political economist and development researcher, Adefolarin A. Olamilekan, told Blueprint that Nigerians should not be too surprised as borrowing was becoming a characteristic of the present administration.\n\nHe added that continuous dependence on oil was making it difficult to get other sources of funding the country\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a surprise going by the character of the Nigerian state and the structure of its economy. First, it\u2019s a dependent, de-industrialized economy that is import-driven. Secondly, it runs and survives as a mono-cultural petro dollar and rentier state for revenue. Regrettably, since 1999 the annual budget of the country has always fallen into the prevailing circumstance of borrowing to cover up for the budget deficit, even when we earned so much from crude. Our economic managers still find reasons to borrow. Obtrusively, it\u2019s crystal clear that the 2021 budget is facing an implementation issue.\u201d\n\nTo escape the urge for more borrowing, Olamilekan, said government officials must come up with creative ways of tackling the country\u2019s economic challenges\n\n\u201cOne is obliged to as a matter of concern for objectivity and national interest, avoid the altar of selfishness. Moreover, a desired policy to address the country\u2019s budget deficit cum economic challenges is not farfetched if the government is serious, especially as present opportunities for creative solutions abound with us.
