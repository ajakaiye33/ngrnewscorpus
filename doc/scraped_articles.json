          "text": "The Lagos and Ogun state police commands have beefed up security in different parts of the states to avert any possible attack by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra and its Eastern Security Network.\n\nThis followed a statement by the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, during a security summit chaired by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, that the command was investigating threats by IPOB to attack soft targets in the state.\n\nREAD ALSO: Hisbah arrests Kano \u2018couple\u2019 for allegedly buying baby for N900,000\n\nWhile reacting to the CP\u2019s revelation, the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, had refuted the claim in a tweet.\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, had also described the claim as a rumour aimed at causing division, crisis and conflict among Ndigbo and their host communities.\n\nOur correspondent, however, gathered that undercover police personnel had been deployed in places hosting critical infrastructure and institutions, as well as areas with high population of people from the eastern part of the country and motor parks in Lagos.\n\nOdumosu told our correspondent that the command had put in place measures to curtail any potential attack by IPOB because it could not disregard such a threat.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to assure members of the public that inasmuch as we don\u2019t work on rumours, at the same time we don\u2019t disregard them. When we got the intelligence report, all the stakeholders in the security industry were sensitised.\n\n\u201cResidents, including landlord associations, were also sensitised. Self-security consciousness is the best; if you observe something that is abnormal in a place, you take precaution.\n\n\u201cWe have enlightened residents and landlord associations about self-security consciousness. In conjunction with the state Ministry of Education, we also organised a series of lectures, where I had interactive sessions with all the proprietors of public and private schools with boarding facilities.\u201d\n\nOdumosu stated that the command had also held a summit with relevant stakeholders to strengthen security around the borders and the riverside communities, adding that the command was also working with the Ogun State Police Command to secure border towns of the two states.\n\nThe CP said, \u201cDuring the summit, many contributions came up and we have empowered our marine police. It is only Ogun State that we share water and land boundaries with. We have moved round to all the borders of Lagos and Ogun states, and we have a synergy with the Ogun State Police Command.\u201d\n\nThe Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, said although the state had yet to get any intelligence report suggesting any planned attack, the proximity of Lagos to Ogun State had prompted the command to expedite measures to fortify the security system.\n\nHe said, \u201cGenerally, we have on the ground what I call adequate measures directed towards containing all forms of crimes, and our measures include surveillance in areas we think are vulnerable, including highways, public institutions, buildings and individuals, who are exposed to high risk of security like politicians, private businessmen, schools, farms, banking institutions and other financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe have a security template that is directed towards ensuring adequate security of these areas. On the issue of IPOB, I won\u2019t say I have not heard that information as it is flying around in the social media, it should suffice to say that we have our measures to curtail this kind of crime and we are watching very closely.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Obvious inter-agency rivalry between the police and the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission played out in the early hours of Tuesday during a sting operation by the anti-graft agency to arrest some suspected Internet fraudsters in Osogbo, Osun state.\n\nPUNCH Metro learnt that some EFCC operatives from the agency\u2019s Ibadan zonal office stormed the Halleluyah area of Osogbo and broke into some buildings, where over 30 suspected Internet fraudsters were arrested.\n\nREAD ALSO: Chinese abducted, two soldiers, scores of bandits killed in Niger attack\n\nThe team, which also recovered several vehicles from the suspects, was said to be heading out of Osogbo, when some police personnel said to be responding to distress calls from residents, intercepted it and prevented it from moving away with the vehicles.\n\nResidents of Omobolanle, Halleluyah, Lameco and Oroki Estate areas of the city, who spoke to PUNCH Metro, said they heard gunshots early in the morning, but could not identify those behind the shooting.\n\nIt was learnt that while the EFCC operatives and the police engaged in altercation over the manner in which the operation was carried out, friends of the suspects mobilised and staged a protest and blocked some roads in the metropolis.\n\nAs early as 4am, the protesters had set up bonfires at the Lameco junction along the Osogbo/Ilobu Road and the Dele Yes Sir area, forcing motorists to take alternative routes.\n\nAfter the bonfires were dismantled by the men of the Joint Task Force, the protesters moved to the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, where the state Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Mr Yemi Lawal, addressed them and advised against blocking of roads.\n\nHe said Governor Gboyega Oyetola had ordered him to visit Ibadan and engage the EFCC on the issue with a view to securing the release of the suspects.\n\nOne of the protesters, Sayo Ogunleye, said the EFCC operatives entered the premises, where the suspects were arrested, like thieves and demanded the immediate release of those apprehended.\n\nAddressing the protesters in the Oke Fia area, the state Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, said the EFCC did not inform the command before carrying out the operation.\n\nHe, however, pleaded with the youth to allow peace to reign and avoid acts that could inconvenience others.\n\nOlokode stated, \u201cWe are not also happy about the situation. The EFCC did not inform us before coming to Osun to arrest those people. That\u2019s why they came in the night.\n\n\u201cThe state government has mandated the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Yemi Lawal, to visit the EFCC office in Ibadan to get to the root of the matter and secure the release of the boys. We have been able to recover their cars, which were seized. I just want to plead with you to allow peace to reign, because blocking the roads and burning tyres will inconvenience other people.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC later said its operatives arrested an ex-soldier, Adebisi Jamiu, and 33 others for alleged Internet fraud.\n\nA statement by the Head, Media and Publicity, EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, revealed that the suspects were picked up in different locations in Osogbo in the early hours Tuesday.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe 22-year-old former soldier, Jamiu, and the other suspects were arrested on the strength of verified intelligence on their alleged involvement in cybercrime.\n\n\u201cThe other suspects include Muritala Olaniyi Lateef, Wasiu Olajide, Wasiu Sadiq, Olaniran Abiodun, Ayodeji Tosin, Olaniran Tayo, Oginni Oluwaseun, Oginni Olatunde, Ojuade Oluwafemi and Ibrahim Wande.\n\n\u201cOthers are Oladiran Olayinka, Akinjobi Akinwunmi, Abayomi Aderohunmi, Olaoluwa Temitope, Idowu Olawale, Lawrence Taiwo, Ojo Gbenga, Tiamiyu Farouk, Oladele Seun, Akiniyi Boluwatife, Olaoluwa Mutiu, Olakunle Omolofe, Olalere Samad, Edbadon Johnson, Oketunbi Kayode, Gbeyide Tomiwa, Oluwanisola Elmuqsit, Bartholomew John, Ibikunle James, Olamide Oluwaseyi, Yusuf Mohammed, Adebola Ibrahim and Ajayi Muyiwa.\u201d\n\nThe anti-graft agency said the suspects had written their statements and would be charged as soon as investigations were concluded.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

You now have total control to serve yourself; it\u2019s no more customer service but customer self-service.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of the launching was the practical demonstration of the uniqueness of the VULTe application by the Bank\u2019s Chief Digital Officer, Mr. Bamidele Adeyinka to the excited guests.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank also announced special reward packages fo\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

CBN stands ready to support youths that are willing to engage in agriculture.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor stated that a total of 3,107,890 farmers have been financed for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions in the 36 States of the Federation and FCT, from the inception of the programme till date.\n\nHe added that under the 2020 wet season CBN-RIFAN partnership, the Bank had also financed 221,450 farmers for the cultivation of 221,450 hectares in 32 States.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "Security agencies remain helpless as South East descends to anarchy, policemen hide uniforms",
          "text": "Since February when the first attack on police men commenced, rather than abate, there have been increasing cases of such attacks, in all the South eastern states, and this has spiralled into the South South, with states like Rivers, Delta, Akwa Ibom and Cross River getting its own share of the ugly incident.\n\nWhat began as attacks on policemen on checkpoints in remote areas of states in the South East zone has further moved to taking battles right to the stations of policemen, killing them and burning down facilities, and most worrisome is that it is now happening in urban areas, some of the places deem to be the most protected.\n\nDAILY POST reports that this has now become a worrisome trend in the zone, and has moved from just police facilities to other government institutions, with offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) being burnt down in some states of the zone. More worrisome is that no one or group has owned up to the attacks, nor have they been any reason for the action.\n\nAs this continues, gradually, our reporter observes that the South East which used to be the safest part of the country in recent times is gradually descending into anarchy, with other forms of insecurity now plaguing the zone.\n\nDAILY POST can authoritatively report that today, on every road in the South East, there is hardly any presence of policemen, while the few that can found are military. While the police whose job is to maintain peace in the country internally have disappeared, the military who should be concerned with ensuring that the country is safe from external aggression and any other that can threaten its sovereignty have now taken over the job of internal security.\n\nThe near absence of policemen in the society has taken an attendant effect on the society, with lawlessness becoming the order of the day today. Besides the Unknown gunmen who today terrorize every part of the zone, there have been cases of herdsmen killings in states of the zone, while not leaving out the twin problems of cultism and armed robbery, a result of the near absence of policemen.\n\nWithin the month of May, 2021, there have been attacks on police facilities in all the five south-eastern states of Nigeria, with attendant loss of property including vehicles and buildings, and in extreme cases, loss of lives.\n\nJust as the month of May set in, two policemen were killed in an attack in Obosi, Idemili North LGA of Anambra State, while the station was razed down. This happened barely 24 hours after a new Commissioner of Police, Christopher Owolabi, assumed office in the State.\n\nOn the same day in Ebonyi State, a police Inspector was shot dead after gunmen attacked Obiozara Divisional Police Station in Uburu, Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. The State Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Loveth Odah confirmed the incident, explaining that the gunmen also attempted to set the police station ablaze.\n\nIn Owerri, Imo State, a bunch of hoodlums invaded the Divisional Police Headquarters in Orlu and tried to burn down the facility, but a joint security operatives resisted them, and luck ran out on them this time and no fewer than eight of them were killed. The team also recovered seven vehicles the attackers came in with for the operation.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that the gun duel created by the resistance sent panic into residents of the area, as people scampered for safety. A resident said: \u201cwe slept with our hearts in our hands last night,\u201d just as some people were wounded by stray bullets as the operatives and the attackers battled each other.\n\nMeanwhile, as this act of lawlessness continues, the attackers have moved from just burning down police stations and killing policemen to other government facilities. The target this time seems to be offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission. So far, three states of Abia, Enugu and Imo have had INEC offices in their states burnt down.\n\nJust two days ago, some hoodlums launched an attack on a police station in Abia, killing two policemen in an early morning attack at the Ubakala Police station in Umuahia South council area of Abia State. The bandits also carted away two rifles belonging to the slain policemen. The hoodlums also destroyed vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles parked in the compound, while setting ablaze the main building of the police station.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough bad news, in Enugu, hoodlums attacked the state headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, setting the foyer and six vehicles ablaze, while destroying two other vehicles.\n\nA week before that, the INEC office in Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State was set ablaze. Before then, there was the destruction of the office in Essien Udim LGA of Akwa Ibom State on 2nd May, 2021. This was followed by the fire at the Ohafia LGA office in Abia State on 9th of May 2021.\n\nSo far, there have not been reports of any group owning up to the attacks or giving reasons for their action. But as a result of the attacks, DAILY POST gathered that conventional policing in the zone has stopped, while stations that have the courage to open no longer accept reports of crime. The attendant report is that crime level has gone up.\n\nIn Awka, cultism has gone a notch higher, with cases of cult killings going higher on a daily basis. In Amanyi and Ifite parts of Awka, no day passes by without cult clashes, while rival groups have also consistently gunned down opposition members.\n\nIn Onitsha, daylight robbery is now normal in several parts of the city, including Upper Iweka, Okpoko, Nkpor and Onitsha-Owerri Road. Travellers and passers-by are daily dispossessed of their belongings, while others watch with trepidation.\n\nAddressing journalists upon his arrival for resumption of duty, CP Chris Owolabi disclosed that it would be hard for the command to continually put out men in the field, who risk being attacked and killed. \u201cWhat we want to start doing is to move into the communities and even engage leaders and to sensitize the people on the need to stop this act of violence. The policeman is someone\u2019s son, he is someone\u2019s husband and he is someone\u2019s father. He is also affected by whatever condition that others face.\n\n\u201cThe police cannot police you if you do not give them the cooperation to do so. It is for that reason that we are appealing to the people to speak to whoever these people are on the need for peace to return again,\u201d he said.\n\nA lawyer, Mr Chukwudi Eze who spoke to our correspondent, however, said that policing in the South East has come to a halt, and that if this continues for long, the zone may descend to anarchy.\n\n\u201cThe worst situation we have found ourselves now is that the criminal elements already know that governance has failed and the lawlessness is what prevails today, so they are acting with impunity, knowing that there is no one to call them to order by any means.\n\n\u201cGo to Onitsha today, you will find boys riding in a tricycle, and going from one shop to another robbing people in the full glare of everyone. They will start from one end of the street and visit all the shops in that street, and will not be in a hurry to leave. Even in traffic, they rob people and still remain in the same traffic in their keke, and no one will say anything. I saw a boy threatening a girl in a shop at UNIZIK junction the other day. He boldly told the girl that even if he killed her, that nothing would happen because police was no longer working, and what the boy said is true. The system has completely broken down.\u201d\n\nDAILY POST also gathered that an internal memo from the Police headquarters has banned policemen from dressing up in their uniforms from home. Rather, they are advised to carry them in bags and only wear them when they arrive at their offices. This as gathered was to stem the spate of attacks on them. Our correspondent was unable to verify the authenticity of the news as calls to the Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga were not taken nor replied.\n\nMr Eze in proffering solution to the problem of insecurity stated that efforts must be made both by the federal government to get security chiefs to change tactics in dealing with the South East issue, adding that, \u201cthere can never be peace in a situation of injustice. Whether anyone likes it or not, the problem of lopsided appointments by the federal government is part of the reason there is insecurity in Nigeria today, especially the South East zone.\u201d",

The Army placed signs beside the Kontagora-Mariga road indicating ownership.\n\nThe inscription on the signage reads: \u201cNigerian Army Training Area Kontagora Army Land Keep Off/Ba Shiga\u201d.\n\nPRNigeria learnt that the Kambaris were the original owners of the land. But they sold it to the army, over 30 years ago.\n\nAnd while the Army is yet to start training its personnel, bandits have found \u2018haven\u2019 in the fallow land, using it to carry out their terror-inducing crime.\n\nAn intelligence officer explained that the \u2018unfenced and porous\u2019 Army land is the reason bandits have been having a field day invading communities in Northern States.\n\nThe source added that the bandits\u2019 camps also served as escape routes for the criminals when other security personnel were mobilized for counter and rescue operations.\n\nAccording to him, when bandits attack communities surrounding Kontagora town, they flee with their victims and rustle cattle to their camps inside the Army land.\n\nHe said his security agency, on several occasions, informed the military authorities that their domain is used by bandits for cover.\n\n\u201cThey refused to cooperate. They tell us the people our intelligence reports indicate are bandits, are actually not.\n\n\u201cThe military authorities deployed a battalion of Special Forces troops. Before they will be moved into Kontagora, we learnt they were first briefed in Minna.\n\n\u201cThe Commanders of the troops were told to first meet with the Police when they arrive at Kontagora, to strategize on how to storm the bandits\u2019 hideout. They ignored us and \u2018callously\u2019 stormed the notorious camps of the bandits.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, about seven or eight of the special forces soldiers were killed, after their convoy was ambushed by the bandits,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe source said after the incident, the military realized the intensity of banditry within Kontagora axis.\n\nThe Dagachin Fagai in Kontagora appealed to the government to come to the aid of their long-suffering people.\n\nA top military officer confirmed the Nigerian Army has deployed extra troops to Niger to protect the citizens.\n\nThe officer assured that the situation at the barracks\u2019s vast land and communities worst hit by banditry is being looked into for prompt actions.",

          "text": "By Nduka Chiejina (Assistant Editor)\n\nThe Federal Government yesterday appealed to countries that are the main destination for illicit financial flows (IFFs) to freeze, seize and repatriate such funds.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Mrs. Zainab Ahmed made the appeal during a virtual International Conference on Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) and Asset Recovery.\n\nAccording to her, countries that are the main destination for IFFs and their proceeds should take urgent steps to assist in combating this scourge, by preventing the inflow of illicit funds, freezing or seizing assets already in the country, and by ensuring that illicit funds and any proceeds are repatriated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government is also leading the call for African countries to be present when decisions on IFFs are taken at a global level.\n\n\u201cAfrica must have a seat at the table and be well represented during negotiations about illicit funds and their proceeds,\u201d Mrs Ahmed said.\n\nThe resulting domestic revenue losses from IFFs she said \u201care significant, putting developing countries and the entire African region at risk of not achieving sustainable and inclusive development, especially in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic\u201d.\n\nShe said Africa is in a \u201crace to the bottom to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs) as a result of the current international tax practices and treaties\u201d.\n\nThe finance minister lamented that \u201ccommercial activities (particularly aggressive tax avoidance and tax evasion, through trade mispricing, abusive transfer pricing, profit shifting and tax arbitraging) account for approximately 65 per cent of illicit financial flows across Africa\u201d.\n\nMrs Ahmed said in Nigeria and across the African continent, countries \u201csuffer various forms of IFFs, including tax evasion and other harmful tax practices, the illegal export of foreign exchange, abusive transfer pricing, trade mispricing, mis-invoicing of services, illegal exploitation and under-invoicing of natural resources, organised crimes, and corruption\u201d.\n\nThe minister warned that \u201cunless checked, IFFs will continue to significantly erode domestic revenues, enable corruption, threaten economic stability and sustainable development, divert money from public priorities and hamper government\u2019s efforts to mobilize domestic resources and recover better.\u201d\n\nThe recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report on the impact of illicit financial flows on African development she said presented \u201cthe scope and disproportionate impact of IFFs on African countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cCommercial tax evasion and other types of IFFs inevitably impact the allocation of already limited government funds, with disproportionate impact on public services benefiting women and youth\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cConsequently, curbing IFFS can lead to improvements in environmental, social, and economic development in Africa\u201d.\n\nAs one of the most affected countries, she said Nigeria \u201chas demonstrated strong commitment to addressing IFFs through our participation in the Open Government Partnership and the significant progress made in the extractive industry\u201d.\n\nNigeria, she added, has demonstrated that technology-enabled improvements in tax collection and compliance help deter tax crime and facilitate public trust while mainstreaming of transparency and anti-corruption measures into economic-policy-making processes significantly reduces crime.\n\nIn the area of asset recovery, she said Nigeria has \u201ctaken proactive steps towards the recovery of stolen assets, in part through engagement with multilateral stakeholders; bilateral agreements on the return of stolen assets with several critical destination countries including the United States and Switzerland; and the establishment of an independent Financial Intelligence Unit within the Central Bank of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cmore needs to be done across Africa to ensure the recovery of stolen assets, and there is need for enhanced support to African countries from the international community in building the capacity and systems necessary to ensure sustained and effective asset recovery.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Labour warns against plan\n\n\u2022LCCI: we need innovative policy on petroleum\n\nBy Yusuf Alli and Onyedi Ojiabor, Abuja\n\nSubsidy on petrol will soon be withdrawn, Minister of State for Petroleum Timipre Sylva, said yesterday.\n\nThe minister told reporters there is no going back on the decision because the government can no longer afford it.\n\nSylva explained that although withdrawal of subsidy will be painful initially, it will pay off for the poor in the long run.\n\nAccording to him, the present arrangement favours a few rich individuals and firms.\n\nLabour yesterday described the plan to remove subsidy as an attempt to punish the people for government\u2019s inefficiency.\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said although desirable, government needs a stable policy in the petroleum industry.\n\nThe minister lamented that but for the provision of cash from signature businesses from Marginal Oil fields by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the shortfall in remittance into the Federal Account last month would have been unbearable for the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nNot forthcoming on the actual augmentation figure and how long the DPR will continue to intervene, Sylva said: \u201cI cannot say exactly what the figure is. I will have to check with the DPR to get you the figure. Of course, you know that the DPR has always contributed to the federation revenue because they collect royalties and so on\n\n\u201cBut as to filling the gap, it will not always be there, it is not as if the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that after last month, they will not be able to. You may not know when next they will announce it. So, you cannot say that they (DPR) will continue to fill in the gap.\n\n\u201cNNPC announced that they could not make contributions to FAAC and the DPR came to the rescue.\n\n\u201cLuckily the DPR was in the position to step in and the marginal field revenues were used to fill the gap.\n\nSylva added: \u201cLabour and the Federal Government are not on different pages. Even Labour understands but what we have agreed is that we need to have an alternative and the process of putting it in place is what is ongoing.\u201d\n\nThe minister, who spoke to reporters in Abuja, said: \u201cSubsidy removal will come with some pains but the question is, can we continue with petroleum subsidy as a country? If we cannot continue, what options do we have?\n\n\u201cI think the best is take out subsidy. From the government of ex-Military President Ibrahim Babangida in the 80s, it has defied all efforts to withdraw petrol subsidy. Diesel is now deregulated, Kerosine is now deregulated but petrol has defied deregulation. Should we continue with this subsidy?\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government does not lack courage, our President does not lack political will.\n\n\u201c Who is really benefitting from subsidy? It is confusing. Some people are benefitting but certainly not the common man. Though it does not really benefit the common man, when you try to remove it, the common man comes out to defend it.\n\n\u201c Now, can we carry on with subsidy if you consider the amount of money swallowed by subsidy? If you want to carry on with subsidy, how do we get the money to fund it? The best way out is to take out subsidy because if we don\u2019t, we will continue to beg the question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was practiced for a few months, but when the prices began to move up, some people started threatening and we had to return to it.\n\n\u201c This is a democracy and having deregulated for a few months, we had to step back because this government has listening ears,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe price differential is a major incentive for smuggling and it is very difficult to police the borders. We must find a way out of it; if not, you will continue to keep your price down in Nigeria while the neighbouring countries will continue to feed fat on subsidised fuel from Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe PIB is fully on course. We\u2019ve had many meetings with the National Assembly and other stakeholders. Although the National Assembly had earlier promised to pass it in April, but that did not work, I believe that the passage will not go beyond June,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the administration of President Buhari had attracted about $16.3billion Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to the oil and gas sector.\n\nHe explained that the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline which had been on the drawing board will cost $21billion.\n\nHe said the Federal Government will soon disengage from managing refineries.\n\nThe refineries will either be handed over to Operation and Management Contractors (O and M) or allow Nigerians to decide if the government should sell them or go public at the stock exchange.\n\n\u201cThe refineries in Nigeria have been the weeping babies of the industry but we believe that it is important that they are at least made functional before we can say this is the direction to take.\n\n\u2018So if you have a dead refinery, how do you sell a corpse? It doesn\u2019t make sense. Some people say no it is a dead refinery, so why are they fixing it? So what am I going to do with it?\n\n\u201cIs it not better for me to at least resuscitate the dead refinery then look for the option of what to do with it? If I sell it, they will say he is selling a dead refinery but now you say let me resuscitate before selling and they say why are you resuscitating it? So whatever you do they will talk.\n\n\u201cThe so called dead refineries were sold by the administration of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, they shouted and it was reversed.\n\n\u201cSo now we said this time let\u2019s try and fix it and they said why? So you can see the dilemma.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is ensure that the refineries are functional and when it is, the first thing we want to do is not to run it as a government. We want to put an O and M contractor.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we will put out the advertisement for professional refinery managers to bid for managing it. So, it is not going to be subject to government issues anymore when it begins.\u201d",

Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe said across the world, conflicts and coronavirus have gone hand in hand.\n\nHe noted that as governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel, adding that terrorism is no common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\n\u201cAround the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.

Indeed, the resort to terror tactics, disregard to constitutional processes and disrespect for democratic standards to advance their interests of creating an ungovernable space in the region informed the decision of the Federal Government to outlaw IPOB.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe Operation RP in Enugu is the first in the line-up of our strategic plans to restore peace and order across the country\u201d adding that \u201cin the coming days, the special operation will be extended to other parts of the country to address the challenges of banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery.\u201d\n\nIn his address, Governor Ugwuanyi said the occasion could not have come at a better time than now \u201cgiven the bourgeoning insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the exercise would herald the rejigging and re-tooling of the internal security architecture in the South East to bring it up to speed with emerging dimensions of criminality.\n\n\u201cThat expectation, in my judgment, seems more realisable with the reassuring presence of the Ag. Inspector-General of Police here today,\u201d he said.\n\nStressing that his administration fully understands that the primary purpose of government is the security and welfare of the people, as enshrined in the Nigeria\u2019s constitution, Governor Ugwuanyi stated that \u201cpursuant to this leadership responsibility, we have strengthened our Neighbourhood Watch Associations, established Enugu State Forest Guards, which was a novel initiative of the South East Governors\u2019 Forum, and provided security patrol vehicles and communication gadgets to support the security agencies in our state.\u201d",

No fewer than 2,000 buses expected in the first phase of the project while total number of busses for the project is 5,000.\n\nThe governor, however, said the total ban on okada might not be enforced until another two months to give people enough time to get their cowry cards, gauge their response to the scheme, and also measure the scheme\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nAnother 100 High Capacity Buses were also unveiled by the governor. He described the initiatives as part of measures to address insecurity and provide Lagosians with safe, affordable and resilient commuting options.\n\nSanwo-Olu added that the initiatives were part of efforts to achieve a fully integrated inter-modal transport system.\n\nHe promised his administration was working to fulfil its campaign promises to the people.

          "title": "Analysts Differ on Buhari\u2019s Quest for Fresh N2.3tn External Loan",
          "text": "\u2022N\u2019Assembly considers request\n\n\u2022APC mortgaging nation\u2019s future, says PDP\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nFinancial analysts and the organised private sector yesterday expressed mixed feelings over Nigeria\u2019s rising public debt following a fresh request by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly to approve a $6.18 billion foreign loan.\n\nBefore the latest request, Nigeria\u2019s total external debt stood at $33.348 billion, while total public debt stock as of December 30, 2021, which was released by the DMO in March 2021, stood at N32.915 trillion.\n\nBuhari, in different letters to both chambers of the National Assembly urged the lawmakers to approve his request to borrow N2.3 trillion ($6.18billion) external loan to finance part of the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president in another letter also canvassed a concurrent approval by the legislature for a total sum of $3,837,281,256, \u20ac910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000 for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 federal government external borrowing rolling plan.\n\nThe two request letters, dated May 6, 2021, came a month after the Senate and the House of Representatives approved $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government to finance various priority projects and to support states facing fiscal challenges.\n\nBuhari\u2019s requests were contained in different letters addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThe letters were read at Tuesday plenary by the two presiding officers.\n\nThe president said the request for the N2.3 trillion loan to finance the 2021 budget deficit was in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act), which states that no external loan shall be approved or obtained by the minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution.\n\nAccording to him, the loan will enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, health, education, among others.\n\nHe said the loan would be sourced from a combination of multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nAccording to him, from recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds, and this explains why the federal government is proposing that the new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria may be able to raise $3 billion or more, but not more than $6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five-30 years.\n\nHe said the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approached the market.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201dThe purpose of this letter is to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) provided as new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion. The right honourable speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50 per cent or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081 ,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201dThe Senate President and right honourable Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with Nigeria\u2019s debt management strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nFor concurrent approval of donor fund projects, the president, in the second letter, said the projects would be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China Eximbank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nBuhari explained that the projects and programmes in the borrowing plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations as well as the contributions they would make to the socio-economic development of the country, including employment generation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201dSenate President and the right honourable Speaker may also wish to know that all the listed projects form part of the 2018 2020 external borrowing plan and covered both the federal and state governments\u2019 projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVlD -19 response efforts.\n\n\u201dA summary of some key projects in each of the six geopolitical zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\nGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed borrowing plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the House for 2018 2020 federal government external borrowing (rolling) plan to enable the projects to become effective.\u201d\n\nAnalysts Differ over Borrowing Request\n\nSome of the economic experts who spoke to THISDAY yesterday warned that the current bid to accumulate more public debts would mortgage the future of the country and its future generations.\n\nThey were also worried that the current move is not being done in a transparent manner that would enable Nigerians to know the specific projects the loan would be tied to and the institutions the government intended to borrow from.\n\nHowever, some others believed that the current move to borrow externally would enhance the country\u2019s foreign reserves and stabilise the value of the naira.\n\nOne of those who felt that the federal government should jettison the idea of accessing fresh foreign loan at this period is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nEkpo told THISDAY yesterday that he was worried that the current move by the federal government would worsen Nigeria\u2019s public debt management and subject future generations to financial bondage.\n\nHe advised the government to surgically reduce the bloated cost of governance in the country, warning that the government should be more concerned with its debt to revenue ratio as well as solvency and liquidity ratios because oil, which is its revenue base, is very shaky by depending on exogenous factors that it could not control.\n\nEkpo said the country\u2019s debt-servicing burden was taking almost one-third of Nigeria\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo, we are building debts for future generations to pay. Right now, Nigeria is merely scratching at its debt by servicing it without touching the principal.\u201d\n\nEkpo, who was the immediate past Director-General of the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management is also concerned about the transparency of the proposed borrowing.\n\nThe Director-General of Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, said it would be carelessness on the part of this government to be borrowing and building unsustainable debt burden for future generations and succeeding governments.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escape from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn.\u201d\n\nA professor of Finance, University of Lagos, Prof. Winifred Iyiegbuniwe, warned that Nigeria should not continue to borrow and dissipate them on wasteful expenses.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem is that we cannot continue to be borrowing in this manner and dissipate them through wasteful expenses. I have a problem as a financial economist when I am not convinced of what the government is doing with these borrowings. If we can borrow for specified and identifiable capital projects, fine. But if it is to borrow for consumption, no! We should cut our coat according to our cloth.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that all the long talk about removing fuel and electricity subsidies and plugging loopholes in tax collections are yielding nothing. They seemed to be too much talking with too little action. The only foreign borrowing that will make sense is one that is tied to a specific project. So, the government must be more specific about the infrastructure it intends to finance.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that the plan to borrow $6.18 billion external loan would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves but cautioned that it could also lead to heightened debt burden if not channelled to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Head of Research at Agusto Consulting, Mr. Jimi Ogbobine, said: \u201cThis could help boost foreign reserves at this point in time. But what we need to do is to complement it with other policies like the harmonisation of the exchange rate so we can stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) once again because we cannot survive on using loans to boost our foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nOgbobine, however, noted that \u201cthere are other ways of deficit financing because debt is not the only way of getting financing, which could also be done through taxes and sale of assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at all the unproductive assets and think of how we can get them out of the government\u2019s books in order to reduce recurrent expenditures on these assets,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo, said: \u201cWe know government is constrained with a shortage of fund but it should ensure that major part of the borrowing will go to the productive sector. There is really no harm in borrowing as long as it is used for productive purposes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, expressed concern that the rising debt profile of the federal government might not be sustainable because the debts will become a problem when the revenue base is not strong enough to service them.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to cut expenditure and undertake reforms that could scale down the size of government, reduce governance cost and ease the fiscal burden on the government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the debt should be used strictly to fund capital projects that would strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nHe also advised government to shift \u201cemphasis to concessionary financing against commercial debts that are typically very costly.\u201d\n\nAPC Mortgaging Future, Says PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday raised the alarm over another plan by the federal government to borrow N2.3 trillion.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told THISDAY that the additional loan request would mortgage the future of generations yet unborn Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are alarmed like any other Nigerian on this fresh loan request. It is simply to mortgage the nation and the future of the younger ones as they will be held in bondage by debts.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing is that upon all these loans, there is nothing tangible to show with the loans so far obtained. As a party and as Nigerians, we are worried. What is simply happening is just mis-governance and incompetence In all these multiple loans, the truth is that you cannot point any finger and say, this is what the Buhari administration has done with it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Buhari: Insecurity grows propensity for conflict\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Usman Alkali, yesterday launched a new operation to battle the rising insecurity in the South-east.\n\nHe also charged policemen in the region to be ruthless with secessionists.\n\nThe launch of the new security strategy, codenamed \u201cOperation RP\u201d is coming barely 24 hours after the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu State was attacked and property burnt by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums.\n\nAlso yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari said without security, economic opportunity would remain fragile and the propensity for conflict would grow, adding that military gains do not provide the whole solution.\n\nAlkali, at the launch of the operation in Enugu, charged policemen serving in the South-east region to deal ruthlessly with criminals and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing their will.\n\nHe urged policemen to be firm with criminals that may be threatening citizens within their area of jurisdiction.\n\nThe IG advised police personnel participating in the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe police leadership and the entire nation are looking out for two major outcomes as you discharge your duties during this operation: first, to stabilise the security order in the South-east in the shortest possible time; second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the policemen to be civil with law-abiding citizens, respect the rights of the citizens and undertake the operation within the dictates of rule of law.\n\nHe, however, charged them to defend themselves against any armed group that might attempt to attack them, or any police assets and other critical national infrastructure.\n\nHe described the people of South-east as historically peaceful, tolerant, innovative, industrious and entrepreneurial, who are highly respected citizens that have made their marks in the field of academics, scientific inventions and commerce.\n\nHe, however, lamented that although the Igbo are a unique ethnic group that freely and peacefully lives with others across the country and within the South-east, the events of late had altered the positive narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence. This trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria police, military and other security agencies are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 was conceptualised to ensure that \u201cwe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, expressed optimism that the operation would lead to the retooling of security architecture in the South-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday\u2019s event could not have come at a better time than now giving the point of insecurity in the country. In the past week, we have been saddened by the spate of killings of security operatives in their line of duty and destruction of security infrastructure and other public institutions in Nigeria, especially in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that today\u2019s event will herald the rejigging and retooling of international security architecture in the South-east geopolitical zone to bring it up to speed with an emerging dimension of criminality.\u201d\n\nInsecurity Grows Propensity for Conflict\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned that without security, economic opportunity will remain fragile and the propensity for conflict will grow.\n\nHe also said that because of the post-COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and France must seize the chance to strengthen its economic and military ties.\n\nBuhari stated this in an article entitled: \u2018Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Nigeria and France Must Seize the Chance to Strengthen Military and Economic Ties,\u2019 published yesterday by a Paris-based magazine, Le Point.\n\nHe said across the world, conflict and coronavirus had not been far apart and the war against the coronavirus was one Nigeria was fully united with France in a strong determination to overcome.\n\nThe solution, according to him, therefore, is to improve those conditions, as it leaves the people vulnerable to indoctrination.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs governments have struggled to contain COVID-19, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cTerrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorists have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon and Niger.\n\n\u201dWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation Occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon.\u201d\n\nThe president said as the world emerges from COVID-19, there is a chance to rebuild.\n\n\u201cThough we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with the idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for all,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari stated that the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets.\n\nSaying in that context fate is generally linked, the president highlighted that Paris had been active in the common fight.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into a lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\n\u201dNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperation if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating across our borders to cut the head off their groups.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Considers Options on Divestment Plan by Shell",
          "text": "\u2022Says proceeds of marginal fields used to augment FAAC\n\nNdubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe federal government is weighing some options as discussions with Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell Petroleum Development Company, begin over its plan for total divestment from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday in Abuja listed three possible options being considered as comprising a takeover of the company\u2019s stake in the oil and gas industry by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); acquisition by indigenous operators and involving a mixture of local players and other foreign independent operators in the process.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch energy giant has been gradually selling its onshore assets for over a decade in Nigeria.\n\nShell, operator of Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture (JV) SPDC, had recently indicated it would no longer continue to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ben van Beurden, however, said yesterday that its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nHe also told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHowever, Sylva who fielded questions from journalists on the issue stated that while the federal government is in consultations with the oil giant on the divestment move.\n\n\u201cSome actually feel that Shell should not hurriedly divest and to at least stay,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhere Shell has completely divested from a sector is not good for us.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the executive arm is discussing with the National Assembly on the quick passage of the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), saying that the bill will be passed lastest next month.\n\nSylva said: \u201cI want to tell you that PIB is fully on course and we are very happy because we have focused on that for a long time and we had many meetings with the National assembly and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cToday, I believe that we are all basically satisfied with where we are. The National Assembly has given a timeline. They actually gave April but a few things happened. But give or take, I still believe that the passage of the PIB will not go beyond June.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that between now and June, they will pass the PIB. I don\u2019t think we are far away with the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the nation\u2019s future lies in its vast gas reserves, which have been abandoned for decades, adding that the development of the huge gas potential will fast-track the diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cUnfortunately, what should have helped us are the laws around the oil industry and this has not happened over the last 20 years we have been tinkering with the laws. And yet, this law will power a lot of progress in this industry because the problem we have in the gas sector in Nigeria is that there are no clear fiscal regimes in the legal framework.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, harnessing the country\u2019s gas reserves which currently stands at 203 trillion TCF, will not only create jobs but also open more linkages with other sectors of the economy.\n\nSylva stated that the 203 trillion proven gas reserves were discovered in the course of oil exploration, adding that a conscious exploration could yield as much as 600 trillion tcf.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople have become more aware of the need for us to move towards gas. Last year, one of the first things we were able to achieve was the NLG Train7 final investment decision (FID) that has eluded the country for a long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the development of Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves, over $16.1billion has so far come into the country as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nHe added that the Nigeria Gas Commercialisation programme is fully on course, while the autogas policy is being finetuned in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which is to bring in conversion kits and make soft loans available for marketers to fit their filling stations.\n\nFor the policy to work effectively, he said there must be enough vehicles and filling stations.\n\nOn the recent judgement against Nigeria by a Milan court on the Malabu oil deal, the minister stated that the decision on the next move would depend on legal advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe minister also said the $1.5 billion required for the proposed rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery had been secured, adding that putting the refineries in shape was necessary before considering what options are better to run them, including using operations and management (O&M) experts.\n\nOn subsidy removal, Sylva said the federal government did not lack the courage or political will to float petrol price, but was considering stakeholders\u2019 views.\n\nHe stated that proceeds of the recent sale of marginal fields from Signature Bonuses were used to augment the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for April.\n\nOn reports in the social media that he collected $25 million from Saipem to award a contract in LNG Train 7, he said the contracted had already been awarded to Saipem before his appointment.\n\nShell CEO: Nigeria Onshore Oil Incompatible with Company\u2019s Climate Strategy\n\nOil multinational, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yesterday shed more light on its decision to divest from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe company said its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nThe company stated that it had been under increasing pressure from investors to slash emissions and pivot toward cleaner energy, even as the tension was on show at its shareholder meeting yesterday.\n\nBloomberg reported that while speaking at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe balance of risks and rewards associated with our onshore portfolio is no longer compatible with our strategic ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe cannot solve community problems in the Niger Delta and the company has started discussions with the government on how to move forward.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say explicitly that Shell wanted to sell the remainder of its oil assets in the Niger Delta, nor did he provide a timetable.\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term energy transition plan laid out to investors for the first time received overwhelming support, but a competing resolution asking for stricter targets also garnered more votes than ever.\n\nAdding to the tension, shareholders were meeting as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that all new oil and gas developments needed to stop immediately for climate targets to be met.\n\nShell also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its spill-prone operations in Nigeria, where it has been pumping out oil for half a century.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch company has been gradually selling onshore assets in Nigeria for more than a decade, as it sought to put aside chronic problems such as pollution caused by ruptured pipelines and the resulting legal battles with local communities.\n\nThe issue has become more acute in the past year after Shell pledged to transform itself into a clean energy giant and gradually winds down its oil and gas business to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nYet a full retreat would be an obvious endpoint to years of gradual divestment, even as Shell has reduced its total number of onshore licences in Nigeria by half over the past decade and has been focusing on offshore oil fields and gas operations in the country.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 meeting was dominated by investors\u2019 questions on Shell\u2019s climate strategy, ranging from pleas to set more ambitious targets on reducing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuels, to a request that the company \u201cstop apologising\u201d for the products it sells.\n\nWhen asked about an IEA\u2019s new report on stopping new oil and gas fields, Chairman, Chad Holliday, said Shell hadn\u2019t had time to study the report but would do so in due course.\n\nShell\u2019s energy transition plans, which forecast a big expansion in clean energy but also decades more oil and gas production, received nearly 89 per cent votes, while a competing proposal from the group rose to 30 per cent, more than double a year earlier.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "El-Rufai vows not to negotiate with NLC\n\nDeclares NLC president wanted\n\nBy John Shiklam\n\nThe Kaduna State Government has announced the dismissal of all nurses below Grade Level 14 for embarking on strike.\n\nA statement issued on Tuesday by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye, said the state Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed.\n\nThe statement also disclosed that \u201cnurses disconnected oxygen from a two-day-old baby in an incubator on Monday at the Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, when they joined the National Labour Congress (NLC) strike\u201d.\n\nIt added that the nurses involved have been recommended to the Ministry of Justice for prosecution.\n\nIt also directed all government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to submit their attendance registers to the Head of Service, while those in Kaduna State University should submit same to the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and the Commissioner for Education.\n\nAdekeye said: \u201cSalaries that could have been paid to the dismissed nurses will be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty.\u201d\n\nThe statement commended \u201cdoctors and some categories of health workers that are trying to run public health facilities\u201d.\n\nAdekeye expressed \u201cregrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cNurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe government also warned that any academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed, adding that government \u2018\u2019will not tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe statement said the action of the NLC was \u201cequivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens\u201d.\n\n\u201cBandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends.\n\n\u201cEfforts to dress up criminal activity as industrial action do not change the reality of lawbreaking that has unfolded, including their persistently ignoring the prohibition against impeding essential services,\u2019\u2019 Adekeye said.\n\nHe reiterated that the President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba \u201cand his senior confederates in the NLC have been declared wanted and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts\u201d.\n\nThe statement advised Wabba \u201cand his cohorts to report to the Ministry of Justice and the police headquarters to make their statements\u2019\u2019.\n\nAlso speaking with journalists in an interview on Tuesday, Governor Nasir El-Rufai declared that he will not negotiate with striking workers.\n\nThe governor also declared the President of NLC, Wabba, wanted for alleged \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\nEl-Rufai accused Wabba of allegedly attacking facilities, declaring that he will be prosecuted for economic sabotage.\n\n\u201cThey attacked facilities, they engaged in economic sabotage. That is an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act and we want him, we will bring him to justice.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for him, he should report to the nearest police station or report to us. He will be prosecuted for economic sabotage,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that there is no ground for any compromise with the NLC, insisting that the labour union has used its last ultimate weapon and he will not change his position.\n\n\u201cThere is no grounds for compromise. They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything.

The most commonly reported side effects were pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects were mild to moderate in severity and lasted 1-2 days.\n\nvaccine safety,\u201d it said.\n\nAdeyeye said that in line with the NAFDAC\u2019s pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring plan for COVID-19 vaccines, Janssen COVID-19 vaccine will be closely monitored and subjected to several activities that apply specifically to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAccording to her, the manufacturers are required to provide monthly safety reports in addition to the regular updates generated by NAFDAC activities.\n\nJanssen COVID-19 vaccine works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19.\n\nShe added that unopened vaccine vials can be stored and/or transported frozen at -25\u00b0C to \u2013 15\u00b0C for up to 24 months and three months when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\n\nAdeyeye said that the Ministry of Health and National Primary Health Care Development Agency will announce when the vaccine becomes available for use in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They can't come after bandits and they can't come after terrorists, including those in Government. They can't go after them but they are very happy to go after you if you speak your mind.\u201d\n\nHe berated the lukewarm attitude and approach by the Nigerian government in handling the issue of the Afaka abduction and failure to assuage the plight and suffering of the parents.\n\nHe continued, \u201cI feel sad for Nigeria, I feel sad for all these students in captivity; students who wanted a bright future. They could as well have taken to kidnapping themselves so that they can make quick money but they opted to go to school and look at what our government has done to them. See Also Insurgency Give Bandits N100million, 10 Motorcycles To Free Our Children, Parent Of Abducted Kaduna Student To Nigerian Government\n\n\u201cAs a person who has been kidnapped before by the Nigerian government, I know what it means to be in captivity. I know what it means to have zero expectation of when you will leave and when you will join your family.\n\n\u201cNobody is doing anything about your plight. They are not interested. The Federal Government does not care about you. The Kaduna State Governor does not care about you, I heard him say he will never negotiate with terrorists. The same El-Rufai who was blaming former President Goodluck Jonathan for not negotiating with the Boko Haram when Chibok girls were kidnapped has suddenly realised that he can't negotiate with terrorists.\n\n\u201cI am not here to appeal to the government. The Nigerian government has failed the Nigerian people. It is up to the Nigerian people to decide how long they want to continue to tolerate this failure. Don't be afraid of security agents because they have failed too. Soldiers are being kidnapped. A DSS operative was kidnapped, they paid ransom and they killed him and nothing happened.\n\n\u201cThe reason they will not negotiate with terrorists is because the government itself is a terrorist government. Otherwise, they don't know how to negotiate with terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that Nigeria was the only country in the world where people were being beaten and not allowed to cry.\n\nHe accused the government of bias and not being proactive enough in their approach towards making efforts to rescuing the students unlike similar cases in the past.\n\nSowore queried the discrimination against abducted students in Afaka, noting that if the Buhari government can pay the sum of N800 million as ransom for the release of kidnapped schoolgirls in Niger and Katsina states within a week, same should be done for Afaka.\n\n\u201cThere is discrimination against Afaka forestry students; there is something there and it has to do with hardened hearts and wickedness of Kaduna state government and Federal Government. This government said they don't know how to negotiate with terrorists. There was a time Boko Haram appointed Buhari to be their negotiator. If he can be trusted enough by Boko Haram, he should trust himself enough to lead negotiation to release the Afaka and Greenfield students.\n\n\u201cThey love it when people are suffering; they love it when there is pain. Blood and tears are flowing in the land. That is why I am not here to appeal to any government, the truth is that you don't have a government and the earlier you accept there is no government, the better for you.\n\n\u201cWe must not live in the nightmare that these students have died in the captivity.

          "title": "Acumen\u2019s patient capital is providing investment alternatives for companies tackling poverty",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nIn 2017, Sanmi Lajuwomi identified a problem with the solar leasing space in Nigeria.\n\nOptimistic that it was worth further investigation, he pooled his personal funds and that of a high-net-worth individual in the UK, and undertook a two-year pilot study. At the end of the study, he had a better understanding of the customers and the challenges of running a business in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria in 2019.\n\nLajuwomi\u2019s company Winnock began by leasing solar equipment which could save small businesses up to 70% on electricity costs. The company has since added other productive use equipment such as sewing machines, fridges and freezers.\n\nIn 2019, they raised funds from some investors and got connected to Acumen. Impressed by what they saw, Acumen started a conversation with them.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty for the young startup of 10 people. Surprisingly, Lajuwomi got a call from Acumen, they hadn\u2019t concluded the due diligence process but in the light of recent happenings, they made him an offer of a $50,000 grant or convertible debt.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the loan was disbursed and Winnock was able to retain 100% of its staff without a salary reduction. Later in the year, Acumen invested in Winnock.\n\nAcumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. Its first appearance in Africa was in 2006 when its Kenyan office was set up, while its Lagos office was later created in 2012.\n\nOver the years, it has invested across West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and East African countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Collectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\n\nMy first contact with Acumen was through their Acumen Academy online courses. In July 2018, I took their Storytelling for Change course. For a long time, I had thought Acumen was an education company, and that was the starting point of my conversation with Meghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Why these courses?\n\nMeghan Curran: We started with a physical leadership development program, our West Africa fellows program. From that program, we started to think about how we could teach some of those skills to a broader audience so that people working on social change problems anywhere, could access these different pieces of content that would strengthen their work.\n\nThat\u2019s how the online courses came about. We started the online courses in 2012/2013 and to date have had more than 500,000 people participate in courses around the world in over 193 countries. The curriculum has expanded to include more courses asides leadership. The objective of these courses is to just help social entrepreneurs we may end up eventually investing in someday or generally help build other entrepreneurs who want to build their own skills.\n\nDA: Now that we\u2019re clear Acumen is not just an education company, What does Acumen do?\n\nMC: The original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. The best of both of those worlds is what we now call the patient capital approach. What that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\n\nOnce we make that investment, we\u2019re often doing equity deals and holding our position in a company for a number of years. When we exit our stake in the company that capital is returned to us. In a typical investment fund that returned capital would go back to the investors who had put money in and they would earn their returns.\n\nIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen and we redeploy it and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\n\nThe second thing that\u2019s really important is that we also have flexibility in terms of returns. Most investment funds have a specific return target that they\u2019re committed to achieving, because we\u2019re not returning capital to our investors, we\u2019re just trying to recover exactly what we put in. We have somewhat moderated return expectations, and this enables our entrepreneurs to really stay focused on the social objectives that they\u2019re trying to achieve without being forced, either to do something like pursue growth at all costs, and to hit exponential scale overnight.\n\nDA: How do you pick the companies you invest in?\n\nMC: Over the last couple of years in West Africa, we\u2019ve been focused primarily on renewable energy and agriculture. In both instances, we\u2019re looking for companies that have been operational anywhere from two to five years and have demonstrated a track record and revenue growth.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be profitable at the time we invest. In fact, most of them are not. There has to be a path to profitability where we can see where the break-even point is and where they will become profitable. I would say the thing that\u2019s consistent across any of the companies we look at is really wanting to get to know the entrepreneur. The assessment of the entrepreneur or the founding team is on two or three different levels. The first is values alignment. We\u2019re not trying to impose Acumen\u2019s mission or social objectives on an entrepreneur. We want to find entrepreneurs who, independent of Acumen, are interested in creating the same type of impact we want to see. Obviously, a significant percentage of their customer base has to be individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nThe second piece is the operational and technical capacity of the entrepreneur or the founding team. This means that they have done their homework on the industry or the sector that they\u2019re working in. It\u2019s sometimes reflected in the strength of the team that they have around them.\n\nDA: What are the sectors you\u2019re focused on?\n\nMC: The last couple of years we\u2019ve been really focused on renewable energy and agriculture. We\u2019re really starting to shift our impact definition to be inclusive of other sectors or business models.\n\nWe are asking ourselves how we look at transportation, waste management or light manufacturing, sectors that are often employing large numbers of low-income individuals and where they can make adjustments to their business models, to ensure that the jobs they\u2019re providing pay a living wage or create some kind of social safety net.\n\nDA: In your world of patient capital, How long does it take to do due diligence?\n\nMC: It really depends on how prepared the company is when we meet them and where they are in their stage of development. For our due diligence, It\u2019s just really about understanding the business model, understanding what their growth projections are and what some of those underlying assumptions are. That can take a month or two. Our more formal diligence where we\u2019re out doing these other interviews, conducting site visits, talking to customers, suppliers, other investors that you may have. Also doing our own kind of market research and market landscaping to make sure things all add up.\n\nThat can take another month or two. Once we get the investment approved there\u2019s documentation and that\u2019s where the lawyers come in and we\u2019re negotiating the details of the terms. From when we first meet you to when we make the investment, I would say six to nine months.\n\nMeghan Curran of Acumen Fund visit to PIND Foundation, Warri Office\n\nDA: What does a typical investment from you look like?\n\nMC: We do anything from $200,000 to $500,000 as the first investment.\n\nI would say there\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned along the way. When we started out, we didn\u2019t expect that if we could help these companies achieve scale, that there would be a long line of other investors waiting to follow us, but that there would be an availability of secondary capital that would enable us to exit. What we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s challenging for a couple of reasons. The markets we operate in are still in some ways underdeveloped such that most investors that are coming in, want to see their cash go to grow the company, not to buy existing investors.\n\nThe second piece is that we find that some of our entrepreneurs actually really value having Acumen as a board member to help protect that social objective. They sometimes don\u2019t want us to leave even when there\u2019s an opportunity. This is challenging and in a good way, but still challenging. What we\u2019ve started to do, with some of our more recent investments to address this, is to experiment with different investment instruments that enable us to have a clearer path to liquidity. In a recent investment we did in Sierra Leone, we actually structured it as a self-liquidating equity instrument where I think after a six or seven year period, the company has the opportunity to buy back shares from Acumen. In this way, the ownership stake eventually stays with the entrepreneurs and with the company, we have a path to some capital recovery, and yet in the short term, it\u2019s equity financing, that gives them the freedom and wiggle room to do what they need to do in the short to medium term.\n\nIn general, we end up holding our investments anywhere between seven to ten, sometimes up to 12 years, but we are trying to be creative about how we structure those investments to reduce, or to shorten that time horizon.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other \u2018traditional\u2019 investors considering the fact that there\u2019s only so much an impact fund can do?\n\nMC: I think we really see ourselves as a feeder to some of those more traditional investors. In the version of the world where everything goes according to plan, we\u2019re investing in some of these companies still at a relatively early stage. We\u2019re often the first institutional investor that they\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re able to accompany them to hit a certain growth trajectory or a certain level of maturity and scale, that\u2019s when they then become more attractive to some of those more commercial or traditional investors. We really see ourselves as helping build that pipeline of investments. What we see in West Africa is that there is a decent number of equity investors that are looking for investments where they want to put in a million or $3 million. Some even start at $5 million and there aren\u2019t that many companies that can absorb that type of capital.\n\nDA: How do companies find you or you find companies you invest in?\n\nMC: It\u2019s definitely a mix. We participate in the startup ecosystem. We go to different business plan competitions or industry events. We\u2019ve partnered with a couple of other earlier-stage investors to try to get to know and develop the pipeline.\n\nThrough our fellowship program and through our online courses as well. What we\u2019re really focused on in this coming year is continuing to push our footprint beyond Lagos and Abuja. We really want to go out to some of the other cities in Nigeria and be able to generate and develop a pipeline that\u2019s beyond the usual suspects.\n\nA session at The East Africa Acumen fellows program\n\nDA: What is a notable investment for you?\n\nMC: d.light which we first invested in 2007. The founders of that company from the beginning were really keen on developing a product or a suite of products that will be affordable for low-income consumers. They didn\u2019t develop the first solar panel but what they did was take a $20/25 product and push it down to be a $5 product. From there came solar home systems and now we\u2019re getting into solar appliances and not that they were the only company, but they were definitely one of the first movers and one of the early companies to really see low-income communities as a market.\n\nWe ended up making five different investments in delight over a 10 year period. We\u2019ve now partially exited and the company I think has served 80 million customers around the world. Not all of them in Africa, but a significant concentration. That\u2019s definitely one of our success stories.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging. The response to that has been some of these more creative financing instruments, whether it\u2019s doing revenue-based financing or these other self-liquidating instruments.\n\nAnother trend, which I think is a little more unfortunate is that the impact investing landscape has become pretty crowded with impact investors that are looking for market-ratemarket rate returns. At that point, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish the impact funds from the commercial funds. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself because I do think there are business models that have fewer trade-offs between impact and returns.\n\nDA: See trends in terms of sectors?\n\nMC: All of a sudden everyone is doing something that\u2019s agritech. Although there\u2019s a lot an app can do, there\u2019s also a lot more, particularly when you\u2019re working with small farmers, that is always going to be offline.\n\nWe look at agritech companies and we\u2019re really trying to evaluate what are their tech capabilities, as well as their offline capabilities? In some instances, offline is the harder part of the work. I think entrepreneurs need to have an awareness that tech should enable your solution, but it can\u2019t always be \u2013 it won\u2019t always be \u2013 the full solution.\n\nDA: Which Acumen courses would you recommend?\n\nMC: I would say the adaptive leadership course. Adaptive leadership is a framework to help think through problems that are complex with no known solution. On the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data. I think a lot of social entrepreneurs know in their head what they\u2019re trying to do in terms of the impact that they want to see, but being able to quantify it is a challenge.",
          "summary": "Acumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives.\nCollectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\nWhat that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging.\nOn the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data.",

          "text": "In March, Nigerian startup Termii raised $1.4 million in a seed round. Future Africa co-led the round with Kepple Africa Ventures, a Japanese Africa-focused venture capital firm.\n\nIt is not clear how much Future Africa invested in Termii but the firm can invest up to $500,000 in deals, thanks to the Future Africa Collective, its community of angel investors.\n\nIt turns out Future Africa has done a dozen other deals since. Other investments this year have been in Kenyan startups Lami and Ongair, as well as in Stitch, a South African company building APIs for open banking.\n\nThe firm says it has invested $3 million in 13 startups in the first five months of 2021. By doing so, they have doubled their 2020 performance in dollar terms.\n\nFuture Africa invested $1.2 million in 14 startups in 2020. They returned $3.7 million to some of the firm\u2019s first limited partners after profitably exiting some legacy positions through secondaries.\n\nFuture Africa has now made 47 investments as a fund. Launched in 2020, the firm operates an institutional venture capital fund (\u201cFuture Africa Fund\u201d) and a subscription-based syndicate composed of Africa-focused angel investors (\u201cFuture Africa Collective\u201d).\n\nMembers of the Future Africa Collective pay $1,000 annually for the opportunity to invest a minimum of $5,000 per deal. Future Africa Fund alone invests a maximum of $50,000 per deal.\n\nOlabinjo Adeniran, a Future Africa co-founder, said members of the Future Africa Collective will have access to 20 deals in 2021. These 20 will be part of 100 startup investments that the Future Africa Fund plans to make this year.\n\nSeen in that light, it looks like Future Africa is behind schedule with 13 investments after four months. Adeniran confirms that not all 13 investments have been offered to members of the Collective, so the firm is also behind on the 20-startup target.\n\nBut \u201cwe think we are going to exceed the target number on both ends,\u201d Adeniran says to TechCabal.\n\nFuture Africa chose not to disclose the 9 other investments it has made because the startups have not announced the funding. But they did drop a few hints:\n\nTwo digital banks: one for financial organisations transacting between Africa and the UK; the other for African migrants.\n\n\u201cA pharmaceutical startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to solve the drug counterfeiting problem in Africa\u201d\n\nA startup that \u201chelps businesses create flexible virtual and physical cards for multiple purposes\u201d which might be Sudo (Adeniran declined to confirm or deny).\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s initial investments were centered around Nigerian startups like 54Gene, Bamboo and Eden, but the firm is taking a more pan-African outlook. Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are now represented on the firm\u2019s portfolio map.\n\nBeyond the appeal of building a pan-African suite of investments, Future Africa hopes to fund more women-led startups. At the beginning of the year, the firm set out to invest $1 million in women-led startups.\n\nIt appears Future Africa has met that milestone, though no details are provided about the women-led startups. We know Lami, one of the new investments, is co-founded and led by a woman \u2013 Jihan Abass.\n\nFuture Africa plans to fund more women-led startups, pushing past the initial $1 million goal.\n\n\u201cWe are going to announce some new structures soon that will enable us move even faster and invest in more startups,\u201d Adeniran says. \u201cIt should be ready within the next 3 months.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside Klasha\u2019s mission to help 5,000 global retailers sell and ship to Africa",
          "text": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the first week of May, the eve of Klasha\u2019s public launch. Jessica Anuna is showing me a demo of a customer adding items to a cart in an online store, filling in billing details and paying through Klasha.\n\nA few seconds later, her phone beeps with an email notification that her demo order has been placed, with a receipt attached for proof.\n\nAnuna exudes the relief and excitement of a founder and CEO who has built an e-commerce payments product from scratch after nearly three years. Klasha is her solution for global merchants looking to serve Africa\u2019s increasingly digitally native consumers.\n\n\u201cWith Klasha, merchants would not have to open individual country stores. They can now make their existing global e-commerce stores Africa friendly,\u201d Anuna says.\n\nThe business case\n\nOpening individual country stores is a secondary headache. For merchants who want to sell in Africa, the first problem is setting up country-by-country payment connections.\n\nTo do this well, these merchants have to be present on the ground and do some dreary work, like managing currency conversions themselves.\n\nKlasha Checkout essentially absorbs all of that responsibility into one payment gateway. Hear Anuna explain how Klasha manages exchange rate fluctuations:\n\n\u201cAt the time the customer pays for the item, the exchange rate is locked in. That way, we are able to remit the equivalent value to the merchant. In the merchant\u2019s dashboard, they can opt to pay themselves out at different exchange rates.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to payments, Klasha\u2019s e-commerce feature includes a logistics service. This service is built to convince high-growth brands, doing above $20 million in gross merchandise value, that Africa is a destination to take seriously.\n\nHer pitch is that when a merchant sets up a Klasha Checkout option on their website, Africans will more readily purchase items in their local currencies. Ghanaians pay with mobile money. Kenyans pay with M-Pesa. Nigerians can pay with Naira bank cards.\n\nBundling logistics and payments\n\nAt the moment, Anuna says they have retailers from the US, UK, the Middle East, and some conversations are ongoing with retailers in Japan. Their focus is on retailers selling fast-moving consumer goods that are not perishable \u2013 clothes, shoes, bags and electronics.\n\nKlasha will make revenue by taking commissions on sales and offering subscriptions to merchants, especially for add-ons like analytics. In exchange, the startup helps merchants collect payments from and ship directly to African buyers\u2019 doorsteps in no more than 9 working days.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous promise, especially the logistics aspect. Klasha is primarily a payments company. To fulfil deliveries, they will be partnering with two different logistics companies; the first brings the merchant\u2019s goods into Africa while the second delivers to the customer\u2019s door. In Nigeria, Anuna says they are ready to deliver to every local government area.\n\nWhy is a young startup burdening itself with this complexity, knowing how poor road infrastructure in Nigeria hampers efficient logistics?\n\nAlthough she held back details of Klasha\u2019s logistics, Anuna is confident that the company can deliver on a dependable model, which won\u2019t make consumers pay higher prices than other payments and shipping options.\n\nShe\u2019s relying on her experience at Amazon, Net-a-Porter and Shopify, plus four years in China running a logistics business.\n\nJessica Anuna, founder and CEO of Klasha. Image credit: Klasha\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t built Klasha alone. A glass wall separates the room where we meet from an adjacent room where her developers are having a chat, their laptops displaying several lines of code in pink and other colours.\n\nThe sales team, led by Fumi Aoki, is in another room crouched over computers. Aoki joined recently from Senri, a sales automation startup. Other members of the 11-person Klasha team have Nigerian startup experience from places like OPay, Andela and Boomplay.\n\nShooting for 5,000 Klasha merchants\n\nI wonder if Klasha can go on to integrate emerging fintech offerings \u2013 like Buy Now Pay Later. Anuna says her team has discussed it, but it is not on their short-term roadmap.\n\nAt the same time, she tries to sell me on the Klasha mobile app. The app enables users to generate virtual cards & shop on online stores regardless of whether the store has Klasha Checkout or not.\n\nKlasha\u2019s virtual card carries VISA\u2019s emblem and allows users to spend beyond the $100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The other distinct feature of the mobile app is sending money to peers using Twitter-like handles, which reminds me of Abeg, the peer-to-peer payments startup owned by Piggyvest.\n\nKlasha is in the virtual cards business. Goodbye $100 limits?\n\nAfter an hour-long conversation, I leave Anuna and her team to continue launch preparations. At least one influencer was drafted for publicity on D-Day; to drive app downloads.\n\nBut that will not be the metric to assess Klasha in three, six, or nine months. Instead, look out for how many major online stores and marketplaces Anuna has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have 5,000 merchants by Q1 2022,\u201d she says.\n\nHow many do they have right now? \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but we are on track.\u201d",

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

It, once again, surpasses previous records as it has now successfully closed the largest financing round in its sector in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nThe company was founded in 2019 by Mahmoud Ibrahim, former COO of Daraz \u2014 an online marketplace and logistics company that operates in South Asia and Southeast Asia \u2014 and Ibrahim Mohamed, former Head of Logistics at Jumia.

The Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for their monthly active messaging customers reduced from KSh 60.77 to Ksh52.7.\n\nFor voice services, revenue fell by 4.6%, with a decline from KSh 86,349.4 million ($804,826) to KSh 82,55.0 million ($769,473). The ARPU for active monthly voice customers went from KSh 287.16 to KSh 257.72.\n\nInternet revenue took an impressive leap from KSh 39,641.9 million ($369,513) to KSh 44,793.2 million ($417,554). With a year-on-year increase of 11.5%. This has been the trend as other telecom giants in Africa recorded revenue boosts in Internet data in recent financial reports.\n\nM-Pesa gets shaky\n\nIn this fiscal year, the company\u2019s mobile money platform, M-Pesa, experienced a slight dive.\n\nIn what happens to be the first of its kind, revenue dropped by 2.1% in the first half of the financial year, falling from KSh 84,382 billion ($786, 545,581) to KSh 82,647 billion ($770,410,517).\n\nThis could be because of fees waived on person-to-person (P2P), Bank to M-Pesa wallet (B2C), and M-Pesa to bank wallet (C2B) transactions of KSh 1,000 ($9.32) and below.\n\nThe waiver was to curtail the rapid spread of COVID-19. When the waiver ended in January 2021, P2P transaction charges were reduced by 45% for low-value transaction bands below KSh 7,500 ($69.91), while B2C and C2B transactions remained free.\n\nHowever, M-Pesa recovered significantly. Total M-Pesa transaction value grew by 58.2% YoY to KSh 22.4 trillion ($208.8 billion).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volume of transactions grew by 29.8% to eleven point six billion. Currently, M-Pesa accounts for 33.0% of Safaricom\u2019s service revenue.\n\nPlans for the new year include setting up 5G trials across more Kenyan cities. The report also reveals plans to launch an M-Pesa mobile application by the second half of the new fiscal year.\n\nFurthermore, Safaricom used the report to publicise its plans to integrate with Amazon. If this integration happens, M-Pesa users will be able to pay for goods with their mobile wallets on the eCommerce platform.\n\nImage credit ajleon on Wunderstock\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Pension contributors navigate maze of PFAs for better returns",
          "text": "The quest for higher returns and better service delivery are driving mass movement of pension contributors to other Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) under the newly approved transfer window.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that PFAs that have remained conservative, sluggish in carrying their contributors and retirees along in terms of engagement and communications are largely being affected.\n\nAccording to latest figures released by the National Pension Commission (PenCom), the number of contributors that have moved has risen by 353 percent to a total of 12,681 in the Transfer Quarter that ended March 31, 2021, from a total number of 2,799 Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders in the maiden Transfer Quarter that ended December 31, 2020.\n\nPenCom says the number more than quadrupled in the last transfer quarter, and expect consistently upward trend, as RSA holders continue to realise the ease with which they can initiate the transfer of their RSAs.\n\n\u201cOverall, the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is revolutionary. Going forward, high standards of service delivery will be a focal point in the Pension Industry,\u201d the industry regulator states.\n\nMost of the movement is happening in RSA FUND II, which is the default fund for all Active Contributors who are below 50 years old, an industry source says.\n\nThe PenCom notes in a statement that the launching of the RSA Transfer System (RTS) on November 16, 2020, heralded the full implementation of one of the cardinal features of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), the portability of RSAs.\n\n\u201cBy this development, RSA holders have been empowered to move their RSAs from their current PFAs to other PFAs of their choice, whenever they desire to do so,\u201d it notes.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the opening of the \u2018Transfer Window,\u2019 as it is popularly referred to, has been embraced by a large number of RSA holders in their quest for better service delivery and returns on investment from PFAs.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has ensured that the requirements for initiating RSA transfers are minimal, and has also been made available on its website, necessary information to guide RSA holders through the process. Specifically, its publication of the \u2018Frequently Asked Questions\u2019 on RSA transfers, provides RSA holders with all they need to know about RTS.\n\n\u201cThe RTS is a fully automated, efficient and transparent process that has pre-defined timelines. It ensures hassle free movement of RSAs across PFAs,\u201d Commission.\n\nAs the transfer of RSAs involves movement of pension assets between PFAs, the entire process attracts the full weight of the Commission\u2019s regulatory surveillance, the PenCom notes. The fact that the process has been completely free of charge has also given RSA holders an added advantage, it states.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming response by RSA holders to the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is, therefore, not surprising. In the maiden Transfer Quarter, which ended on 31 December 2020, a total number of 2,799 RSA holders transferred their RSAs to various PFAs. This number more than quadrupled in the next Transfer Quarter, which ended on 31 March 2021, as a total number of 12,681 RSA transfers took place,\u201d the Commission discloses.\n\nAccording to Olumide Oyetan, chief executive, Stanbic IBTC Pension Managers, in an interview with BusinessDay recently, the transfer window is a positive development for the pension industry as it gives RSA holders the freedom to change their initial selection of a PFA to their preferred service provider based on attributes that are important to them.\n\n\u201cFor us as a company, the transfer window has given us the opportunity to welcome new clients and continually improve our technology and services to meet most of our clients\u2019 needs,\u201d he said.\n\nLeveraging our various educative programmes, the transfer window also gives us the opportunity to enlighten a wider audience, thereby boosting confidence in the Nigerian pension industry as well as the larger financial services industry, he stated.\n\nIbrahim Alhassan Babayo, chairman, Board of Directors, Premium Pensions Limited, said during the company\u2019s annual general meeting that the long-awaited Transfer Window had shifted power to the contributors as they now have the opportunity to switch from one PFA to another.\n\nThe opportunities to move when dissatisfied have an implication on Assets under Management (AUM), though reported that Premium Pension Limited was a net gainer during the maiden Transfer Window quarter, he said.\n\nA consistently upward trend is anticipated, as RSA holders continue to realise the ease with which they can initiate the transfer of their RSAs. Overall, the opening of the RSA Transfer Window is revolutionary. Going forward, high standards of service delivery will be a focal point in the Pension Industry.\n\nAccording to the provisions of the Act that established the Scheme, the objectives of this scheme is to ensure that every person who worked in either the public service of the Federation, Federal Capital Territory, states and local government or the private sector receives his retirement benefits as and when due; and to assist improvident individuals by ensuring that they save in order to cater for their livelihood during old age.\n\nIn the case of the private sector, the Scheme shall apply to employees who are in the employment of an organisation in which there are three or more employees.\n\nNotwithstanding the provision of subsection (2) of this section, employee of organisation with less than three employees as well as self-employed persons shall be entitled to participate under the scheme in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission.",

          "text": "As coronavirus closed businesses around the world and forced millions to stay home, Nigeria\u2019s film industry produced more local movies in 2020 compared to previous four years.\n\nThe arrival of the deadly COVID-19 alongside a nationwide lockdown led to a halt in film and TV productions, costing estimated tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings. However, film producers tried to focus on high-quality movies, growing cinema audiences, as lockdown was eased, and the likes of Netflix pushed to tap into the country\u2019s over 200 million population.\n\nDespite COVID-19 challenges, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show the number of movies produced surged by 477.6 percent to 2,599 in 2020, the highest when compared to 450 movies in 2017. In 2018 and 2019, it produced 565 and 700 movies, respectively\n\nThe NBS data also show that the number of movies produced in quarter one of 2021 stood at 416, almost close to what was made in 2017.\n\nBy location, Lagos had the highest with 149, closely followed by Onitsha with 140 movies, Benin City and Bauchi recorded two movies each, respectively. From the record, data were provided by the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) and verified and validated by the NBS.\n\nExperts in the movie industry have said that the challenges surrounding COVID-19 triggered a new height of creativity among Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cThe fact that more movies were produced in a disruptive year 2020 signals the resilience of the sector, and also highlights that the sector is gradually living up to its potentials,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nSamuel Oniyitan, a movie producer, says the lockdown period provided the time and a little sense of sanity for most of them to write different stories, noting, \u201cBefore the lockdown, we really don\u2019t have much time to write enough stories.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s creative industry is one of the most vibrant in Africa. In recent years, the sector has seen a period of rapid progress facilitated by emerging digital technology, which supports content creation, distribution and consumption.\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC Nigeria), Nollywood, the second largest film producer in the world, contributed 2.3 percent to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2016. The industry is reported to generate between $500 million and $1 billion annually, and is usually busy towards the end of the year.\n\nLast year, Nigerian cinemas closed for six months had to depend on quality local movie content from Nollywood to stay afloat because of the drop in foreign contents.\n\nNollywood took advantage of the lack of foreign content by releasing quality local contents like Omo Ghetto, Fate of Alakada, Quam\u2019s Money, Dear Affy, Rattlesnake: The Ahanna Story, Who\u2019s the Boss, This Lady Called Life, Voiceless, \u00ccf\u00e9, Introducing The Kujus, that glued the Nigerian audience to various online platforms during the lockdown and the cinemas across the country, when lockdown was eased.\n\nIn order to increase its less than 50,000 Nigerian subscribers, last year, Netflix, a global on-demand movie streaming company increased its Nollywood originals on its video streaming platform and also collaborated with Nollywood directors and producers to churn out more local Netflix originals.\n\nRobert Onyeri, a professional filmmaker, says young filmmakers are doing a phenomenal job in reinventing the Nollywood wheel, breaking from the norm, crafting fresh narratives and style on how we tell our stories. \u201cIt would do Nollywood a lot of good to foster and not stifle these young filmmakers,\u201d he states.\n\nDespite the growth in movie production, stakeholders have lamented the insufficient support from the present administration as against the previous President Goodluck Jonathan administration that set up the Nigerian Creative and Entertainment Industry Stimulation $200 million Loan Scheme meant to address major issues in the industry \u2013 distribution, capacity building and content production.\n\n\u201cThere is no funding and structure in place. Goodluck did it and it worked because many people benefited from it,\u201d an official from Filmone Cinemas says.",

Even if they were smugglers, must the custom officers open fire on them?\u201d\n\nThe House, however, mandated the committee on Customs and Excise to investigate the incident and report back to the House within two weeks for further legislative action.\n\nThe House also urged the Federal Government to review the rules of engagement of NCS as it relates to arms usage.\n\nThe House also asked that the Comptroller-General of Customs should liaise with the committee on Customs and Excise so as to ensure compensation for the affected families.\n\nIt added that the erring officers must be prosecuted and ensure adherence to the rule of customs officers not exceeding 40km from the borders.\n\n...",

How can many of us cope with these terrible situations?\n\n\u201cMany of us are widows, in fact, we are really suffering. They promised that things will change, but we are not seeing the signal.\n\n\u201cAll we are getting are promises upon promises. It is time for us to get what is commensurate to our efforts in terms of payment,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso lending her voice, Mrs. Nike Alatise, revealed they started the street sweeping job in 2003 with N2, 500 monthly salary before it was increased to N5, 000.\n\n\u201cOur job is tedious and things are difficult for us. To survive is not easy and what we want is a sum of N30,000 monthly stipend that is in tandem with the N30,000 minimum wage already signed into law in Ekiti\u201d, she posited.\n\nBut Commissioner for Environment Barr. Iyabo Fakunle Okiemen said all the demands of the protesting workers have been taken to Governor Fayemi, according to the Nation.",

Not for the fact that I love to see her beautiful face, but the spice of intelligent conversations. Somebody that loves to see, view, observe and weigh things completely from various perspectives (in the future one that will be the pillar of understanding.)\n\nAgain, she has to be a moral woman. I wouldn\u2019t enforce the godly woman nature that every man feels they are entitled to. Morality does it for me, because I feel that it is a common ground from where we could grow.\n\nI want a woman who is self-reliant and has a goal. She must also know how to cook nice meals.\n\nJustin Dakop: Support!\n\nA partner who supports your personal and career goals, understands that not everything in your marriage will be about them, or even about you as a couple. You both will have individual goals, and they will be by your side cheering you on. They won\u2019t feel threatened by the time and energy you put into achieving your goals because they also have their own life goals.\n\nAn ideal partner that whether they are standing up to you, a family member, or a friend, you want a partner who will not let people treat them badly. If they accept poor treatment from you or others, eventually you may lose respect for them.\n\nFor those reading this, they should also have it at the back of their mind that:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChoosing the right person (and being a good partner yourself) is critical for a lasting relationship and long-term satisfaction.\n\nVeronica Akpan: Riches!\n\nI am of the opinion that before I can settle down with a man, he should be well-to-do. I know some people might look at my view or perspective as irrational due to the ideology most people hold that marriage should be 50/50. I am not of the same school of thought.\n\nI feel my husband should be able to provide for the family singlehandedly. Once I have found that person, then I am ready to settle down.\n\nSuch person is my preference because he can take care of me and my everyday needs.\n\nIfeoma Okoli: Independent Minded!\n\nI want a man who is independent. That way, when he is to make tough decisions, he is able to value himself, plan for the future and know when to come up with a new plan immediately.\n\nA level-headed person is also an ideal man. A person that can be calm in tough situations when I\u2019m tensed; he should be able to calm everything down. I am also want a partner who treats others the way that they want to be treated.\n\nA person who has a kind character is more likely to treat you with care and respect.\n\nI prefer my man that way because it will make life happy and easy for everyone.\n\nJohnson Yakubu: Companionship\n\nWell, I agree with the idea and concept of marriage, spending the rest of your life with someone you can always turn to. The first person you want to inform when the going is good and the one you cry to when things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nI think marriage is God\u2019s way of giving us true companionship. Loving, true to her word, strong, beautiful heart. I like a woman that is thoughtful and caring, respectful and most of all, God-fearing. For the sake of preference, I like smallish women because I am not too big myself.\n\nI also want a woman that is ready to push me and encourage me at all times.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t really have a reason per say but I feel like that\u2019s the right fit for a guy like me.\n\nPriscilla Agbo: Selfless and Loyal!\n\nThough I\u2019m not in a relationship, but my kind of man to marry is a selfless, committed, loyal and consistent person.\n\nKeeping the energy, making sure we help each other grow mentally, spiritually, emotionally in all ramifications of life.\n\nA guy I can make decisions with or someone that can make decisions without me and I won\u2019t fret because I know such decision will be in my own interest.\n\nI prefer such person because that is all I crave for in a partner and once I get someone like that, I am never leaving him.\n\nJulius Mako: Companionship!\n\nMy type of partner is someone I can share my success, failure, peace and crisis with and the love remains the same regardless.\n\nAn intellectual person, who does thinking for us in my absence or when I can\u2019t be reached, she takes the wheel and acts in my place.\n\nAn honest, emphatic and genuine person.\n\nI prefer such person because of the peace of mind/calmness she brings along. And considering my kind of job, I really crave that energy.\n\nMaria Isa: Communication!\n\nMy partner should be someone that can communicate effectively so we can coexist in peace.\n\nA great listener and problem solver because life has its challenges and it is better with this type of partner.\n\nSomeone that is God-fearing. He is not just prayerful, but he is also good to others.\n\nAn understanding person, so opinions won\u2019t always cause conflict.\n\nA man that is considerate and respectful. A family-oriented person because it takes a village to raise a child and you need to have people around to make your home.\n\nA hardworking man that his goals align with yours.\n\nA stable partner that plans ahead so there won\u2019t be any surprises.",

Opeyemi Bamidele categorically stated that the appointment of persons into the NHRC board fell short of the requirement of the Federal Character principle.\n\nHe said the Committee observed that \u201cSection 14 (3) of the Constitution requires that the composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies, should reflect the Federal Character Principles.\n\nFurthermore, Section 3 (2) and (3) of the National Human Rights (Amendment) Act, provides for the composition of the Council to consist of the Chairman and Members of the Commission who shall represent various segments of the human rights community.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is noteworthy to state that the composition of the Governing Council of the National Human Rights Commission as presented to the 9th Senate, does not comply with the provisions of the Constitution as it relates to the Federal Character Principles.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the composition of the Council, as per geopolitical zone, as presented to the Senate, is as follows:\n\n\u201cThat it is imperative to state that absolute compliance with the provisions of the Constitution is not a choice but a fundamental obligation imposed on individuals, Government and all its functionaries, as encapsulated in Section 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.\n\nThe committee stated that human rights issues do not only affect a segment but cut across all parts of the country and as such, \u201call the geo-political zones must be represented in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution, in the light of emerging human rights abuses in the country\u201d.\n\nConsequently, he said there is need that the Senate \u201cdo draw the attention of Mr. President and Commander\u2013In\u2013Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federation to the lop-sidedness in the composition of the Governing Council of the National Human Rights Commission, which is an infraction against the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.\n\nThe committee charged the Senate and indeed the National Assembly to ensure compliance with laws as the parliament do not only make law but also ensures that the laws are complied with, through the mechanisms of checks and balances.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is our duty to draw the attention of the Executive who is saddled with the responsibilities of making nominations for appointments into any position in the country to ensure compliance with the Federal Character Principles in line with the Constitution\u201d, Bamidele said.\n\nRecall that the Senate at its Plenary Sitting on Wednesday, 24th March, 2021, considered President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request, for the confirmation of nominations of the Chairman and Members of the National Human Rights Commission, and referred same to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, for further legislative action.\n\nHe said the Committee interviewed the nominees and received explanations regarding their qualifications, experience in human rights issues, suitability, competence and integrity to assume the positions of Chairman and Members of the National Human Rights Commission, respectively.\n\nThe Committee, in the course of its interactive sessions with the nominees, was briefed about the suitability and competence of each of the nominees, for confirmation as Chairman and Members of the National Human Rights Commission, respectively.\n\n\u201cIn their briefings, the nominees, individually and collectively, demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the law, issues bordering on human rights as well as contemporary issues. They also outlined their vision for the Commission to ensure that its mandate is carried out without interference, as an independent Body.\n\n\u201cThat the nominees possess the requisite qualifications, competence and comportment to discharge the duties and functions of the Governing Council of the Commission;\n\n\u201cThat there is no petition against the nominations of any of the nominees before the Committee;\n\n\u201cThat there are no adverse reports against the nominees, as record checks and other forms of investigations by security agencies, did not reveal any negative trace against them; and\n\n\u201cThat the Committee is satisfied about their qualifications, experience, suitability, competence and integrity to assume the positions of Chairman and Members of the National Human Rights Commission, respectively\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana and Tom Okpe, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has written to the National Assembly requesting for the implementation of new external borrowing of N2.343trillion, about US $6.183 billion, in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nThe letter signed by the President himself explained that the purpose was to request for a Resolution of the National Assembly (NASS) to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) provided as New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the Budget Deficit of N5.602 trillion.\n\nIt further explained that the request is in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment,) Act, 2003 (DMO Act). Section 21(1) of the DMO states that \u201cno external loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution,\u201d while Section 27(1) states that \u201cthe National Assembly may by a resolution approve, from time to time, standard terms and conditions for the negotiation and acceptance of external loans and issuance of guarantees.\u201d\n\nImplementation of the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the Speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as New Borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 Fiscal Deficit, of which 50% or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081 ,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) is specified as New External Borrowing.\n\nThe letter reads: The Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with the Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and to free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nOn funding: \u201cI wish to bring to the attention of the Speaker that the plan ls to raise the sum of USD 6.183 billion from a combination of sources; namely: multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cFrom recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds in the ICM and this explains why we are proposing that the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act, should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Nigeria may be able to raise USD 3 billion or more, but not more than USD 6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between 5-30 years; the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approaches the market.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker may further wish to note that not only is the ICM now open to issuers like Nigeria and Interest Rates lower than the levels In 2020, given the recent monetary policy stance, as well as, rising levels of inflation, the level of liquidity in the domestic market has decreased while domestic Interest Rates are beginning to rise.\n\n\u201cAccessing the ICM will be relatively cheaper thereby moderating debt service cost, and it will also contribute to the level of External Reserves.\n\n\u201cTable 1 for the comparative Yields of FGN Bonds in the Domestic Securities Market and Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds in the ICM of similar Tenors as at March 30, 2021.\n\nAlso see Appendix I for all the outstanding Nigeria\u2019s Securities (Eurobonds and Diaspora Bond) and their respective Yields as at March 30, 2021.\n\nUtilisation of Proceeds at New External Borrowing; \u201cThe proceeds of the USD 6.183 billion (N2.343 trillion New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act) will be used to fund specific Capital Projects in the Budget.\n\n\u201cThis includes projects from priority sectors of the economy including; Power, Transportation, Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Health, provision of Counterpart Funding for Multilateral and Bilateral Projects, Defence and Water Resources.\u201d\n\nSummary of indicative Terms and Conditions\n\nWith respect to the Terms and Conditions of the proposed External Borrowings, the Speaker may wish to note that the multilateral and bilateral institutions operate on standard Terms and Conditions and these are outlined in Appendix II.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Eurobonds, the Final Terms and Conditions (Interest Rate and Tenors) can only be determined at the point of issuance of the Bonds in the ICM, and will be subject to market conditions prevailing at that time.\n\n\u201cIn the event that some or all of the USD 6,183,081 ,643.40 has to be raised through Eurobonds, the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning and the Debt Management Office, working with the Federal Governments appointed Transaction Advisers, will ensure that Nigeria secures the best Terms and Conditions within the context of the market.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Indicative Terms and Conditions are attached as Appendix III for more information.\n\nRequired Resolutions: \u201cAs stated in Paragraph 2, the Speaker may wish to note that the Resolution of the NASS in the attached format (Appendix IV) is required to implement the New External Borrowing of USD 6,183,081,643.40 in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nPrayer; the Speaker may wish to note that, in line with the provisions of Sections 21 (1) and 27 (1) of the DMO Act, a specific Resolution of the NASS is required for external borrowing as stated in Paragraphs 2 and 9.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the House of Representatives is invited to consider and approve a Resolution in the format outlined here-under, which is also attached as Appendix IV as stated in Paragraph 9:\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the New External Borrowing of N2,343,387.942,848.00 (about USDB,183,081,643.4O at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD l.OO/N379) In the 2021 Appropriation Act and that the amount should be raised from multiple sources Multilateral and Bilateral sources as may be available and through the issuance of Eurobonds in the lnternational Capital Market; and the issuance of Eurobonds in the sum of USD$.00 billion or more, but not more than USDG.183 billion approved as New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act,\u201d it stated.",

Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe government also warned that any academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed, adding that government \u201cWe will not tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Special Adviser likened \u201cthe actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens. Bandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cEfforts to dress up criminal activity as industrial action do not change the reality of lawbreaking that has unfolded, including their persistently ignoring the prohibition against impeding essential services,\u2019\u2019 Adekeye said.\n\nHe reiterated that Ayuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC have been \u201cdeclared wanted, and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statement advised Wabba and his cohorts \u201cto report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to make their statements,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the protest turned violent yesterday as one person reportedly died in the process.\n\nThe incident occurred at about 12 noon around NEPA roundabout where the NLC president was to address the striking workers.\n\nTrouble started when people suspected to be government thugs arrived the roundabout by Ahmed Bello Way, venue of the protest and attacked the peaceful protesters.\n\nEyewitness account and our reporter said the protesters started running widely without direction due to the attack while the Police tried to calm the thugs, as the NLC members started pushing their President into a vehicle to leave the scene, at that point the Police opened fire with tear gas and smoked rented the air resulting to chaos.\n\nAmbulance was later sighted carry suspected injured victims while other protesters ran back and forth.",

          "text": "Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger has confirmed that three soldiers had been killed in a gun battle with armed bandits in Magama, Magama Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor made the disclosure on Tuesday shortly after a meeting with security chiefs at Government House in Minna. Bello told newsmen that the military recorded the casualties as it lost three soldiers in the battle that lasted for over one hour.\n\n\u201cTwo bodies of bandits killed during the fight in the area were also recovered on Monday, while the bandits managed to escape with the rest.\n\nThe governor described the latest onslaught on the state, especially against the military, as unfortunate. He said that soldiers and a group of armed bandits on Monday night engaged each other in a gun battle leading to the death of three soldiers. He. however, said that the bandits were being trailed by the Army and assured that they would be arrested soonest. Gov. Bello disclosed that in spite of the banditry activities in the state, normalcy is gradually returning to some of the communities recently sacked by the bandits. \u201cNo fewer than 50 communities have been resettled back in the villages. \u201cThey were led back to their villages by the armed soldiers,\u201d he said. Bello, however, said that now that the rain has started, the people who are predominantly farmers would go back to their farms and start planting. He said this had become necessary because all the affected communities in the three local government areas of Shiroro, Munya and Rafi are major agricultural communities.\n\nThe governor added that with the security cover by the military, farming will commence in earnest and the fear of food shortage next year is being allayed. In another development, the governor said the security agencies had been put on red alert to deal with youth restiveness that has engulfed Minna in the past one week during which many innocent people were seriously wounded.\n\n\u201cThe youth restiveness we have been witnessing in Minna, the state capital, in the past few days is very embarrassing. \u201cWe discussed this development extensively at the just concluded security meeting and I have directed that anybody caught with cutlasses or any other dangerous weapons should be arrested immediately and dealt with accordingly,\u201d he declared. The security meeting was attended by the state Commissioner of Police, the Army, Civil Defence, DSS and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that some youths from different communities in Minna, had been on rampage for the past one week using dangerous weapons to unleash terror on residents. It took the intervention of a combined team of security personnel mobilised from various formations to bring the situation under control.

          "text": "Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger has confirmed that three soldiers had been killed in a gun battle with armed bandits in Magama, Magama Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor made the disclosure on Tuesday shortly after a meeting with security chiefs at Government House in Minna. Bello told newsmen that the military recorded the casualties as it lost three soldiers in the battle that lasted for over one hour.\n\n\u201cTwo bodies of bandits killed during the fight in the area were also recovered on Monday, while the bandits managed to escape with the rest.\n\nThe governor described the latest onslaught on the state, especially against the military, as unfortunate. He said that soldiers and a group of armed bandits on Monday night engaged each other in a gun battle leading to the death of three soldiers. He. however, said that the bandits were being trailed by the Army and assured that they would be arrested soonest. Gov. Bello disclosed that in spite of the banditry activities in the state, normalcy is gradually returning to some of the communities recently sacked by the bandits. \u201cNo fewer than 50 communities have been resettled back in the villages. \u201cThey were led back to their villages by the armed soldiers,\u201d he said. Bello, however, said that now that the rain has started, the people who are predominantly farmers would go back to their farms and start planting. He said this had become necessary because all the affected communities in the three local government areas of Shiroro, Munya and Rafi are major agricultural communities.\n\nThe governor added that with the security cover by the military, farming will commence in earnest and the fear of food shortage next year is being allayed. In another development, the governor said the security agencies had been put on red alert to deal with youth restiveness that has engulfed Minna in the past one week during which many innocent people were seriously wounded.\n\n\u201cThe youth restiveness we have been witnessing in Minna, the state capital, in the past few days is very embarrassing. \u201cWe discussed this development extensively at the just concluded security meeting and I have directed that anybody caught with cutlasses or any other dangerous weapons should be arrested immediately and dealt with accordingly,\u201d he declared. The security meeting was attended by the state Commissioner of Police, the Army, Civil Defence, DSS and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that some youths from different communities in Minna, had been on rampage for the past one week using dangerous weapons to unleash terror on residents. It took the intervention of a combined team of security personnel mobilised from various formations to bring the situation under control.

          "title": "Fresh twists as workers\u2019 protest thickens in Kaduna",
          "text": "The industrial action that has grounded Kaduna state may be far from being over as Governor Nasir el-Rufai ordered the sack of nurses below Grade Level 14 and Kaduna State University (KASU) lecturers who joined the strike.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai also declared the labour leaders as bandits, describing their actions as equivalent of banditry, kidnapping and other security challenges facing the state.\n\nHe also declared wanted NLC President Ayuba Wabba and some leaders of the group for breach of public peace and related offences.\n\nMr. Wabba, the body\u2019s acting general secretary, Comrade Bende Ismail, Vice Presidents, Najeem Yasin and Amaechi Asigiri and Comrade Joe Ajaero among other NLC top guns, led the peaceful protest from its state secretariat to Kaduna state House of Assembly Monday where Wabba gave a speech on why they shutdown Kaduna.\n\nThe decision followed the commencement of NLC\u2019s five-day warning strike and protest that shut down economic and social activities in Kaduna state Monday, literally grounding the state to a halt with the airport, train station, banks, government offices, institutions, filling stations and electricity all shut down.\n\nSpeaking in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, Governor el-Rufai lamented that some nurses engaged in sabotage of some health facilities to join the strike, adding that many nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\nThe governor singled out three nurses of Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, who he said the state would prosecute for allegedly disconnecting the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai said the health ministry had been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed, warning that any academic staff of Kaduna State University (KASU) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not tolerate criminal acts disguised as industrial action. Today, the Kaduna state government reviewed the sundry criminal actions that have defined the campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness waged by the NLC.\n\n\u201cKDSG considers as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days. The state government commends citizens for remaining calm amidst this assault on their rights and comfort and their businesses.\n\n\u201cHowever, KDSG cannot be expected to tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients, unlawful trespass into public facilities and the wanton use of coercion and restraints of personal freedom by the NLC.\n\n\u201cAlso, KDSG cannot ignore the illegal pressures brought to disrupt the operations of banks and other private businesses whose staff and customers do not have any industrial dispute with the state or any other government. KDSG regrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities. Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\n\u201cReports from Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disclosed that some identified nurses disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday, 17th May 2021. The names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby.\n\n\u201cIn addition, KDSG has decided the following: Ayuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC are declared wanted, and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna state, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts. They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike. Salaries that could have gone to them are to be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty. The Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed;\n\n\u201cAny academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed. The authorities of KASU are to submit a copy of the attendance register for all categories of staff daily to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education. All MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service;\n\n\u201cKDSG views the actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens. Bandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends: trying to hold hostage the freedoms, economic interests, livelihoods and resources of the people of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not submit its treasury to the entitled minority. We will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna state even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum. The government remains committed to providing social services beyond paying salaries, always putting the interests of the many ahead of the few,\u201d el-Rufai said.\n\nFurther to that, the governor promised handsome reward for anybody who knows the whereabouts of Wabba and other NLC leaders declared wanted.\n\nEl-Rufai who posted the declaration Tuesday on his verified Twitter handle @elrufai, said the labour leaders were wanted for economic sabotage and attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act.\n\nThe governor\u2019s tweet Tuesday morning read: \u201cKADUNA UPDATE: Ayuba Wabba & others of @NLCHeadquarters declared wanted for economic sabotage & attacks on public infrastructure under Miscellaneous Offences Act. Anyone that knows where he is hiding should send a message to @MOJKaduna. KDSG. There will be a handsome reward!\u201d\n\nArmed thugs attack workers\n\nMeanwhile, a group of thugs suspected to be sponsored by the state government Tuesday attacked labour leaders and workers during the peaceful protest.\n\nThe attacked happened shortly after the governor left the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), adjacent where the workers assembled, with heavily armed security personnel to forcefully install power installation.\n\nThe armed thugs came in a bus brought series of weapons like stick, bottles, stones and machetes.\n\nThe thugs were however overpowered by both workers and security personnel at the venue of the protest.\n\nBlueprint can also report that some of the security personnel who were seen in groups discussing, said the government was planning to declare curfew in the state.\n\nThey described the action as \u201cuncivilised and barbaric \u201c, stressing that the workers were peaceful and orderly which should be commended.\n\nSome workers who tried to confront the thugs while throwing stones were stopped by the labour leaders, while the detachment of security men, police , civil defence, military men, and the Road Safety, who were on ground approached the thugs and tried to persuade and appeal to them.\n\nThe defiant thugs, despite the appeal by security personnel, started throwing stones, and attempt to disperse them with teargas was initially unsuccessful as their actions disrupted the rally before the thugs were finally dispersed by the workers themselves, without any casualty.\n\nWhen the situation was brought under control, Comrade Wabba briefly addressed the workers to end the rally with a promise to use all labour actions available to confront the state government.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the NLC president said the congress was fully aware of the plan by the state governor to unleash thugs on them, and had as early as Tuesday morning shared the information and the clips of the plan with all the security agencies.\n\nHe pointed out that the military, SSS, Police, Civil Defence were all notified earlier and were aware of the plans, alleging the governor himself led the thugs.\n\n\u201cWe said it in the morning. We mentioned the name of the person that was contracted. We mentioned the thugs that will be coming and I told all the security agencies, I called the DSS, I called the police, I told them that this is the credible information we have. We have the clips. This clip was trending since 6 am in the morning.\n\n\u201cThey had the meeting in the night and we shared our intelligence with the Police and the DSS. We were fully aware and that was why we informed the security agencies because it is the role of the security agencies to provide security cover for any protest.\n\n\u201cAnd you saw, he was the person that led the thugs because he came and entered NEPA office (Kaduna Electric) before the thugs came. Our workers wanted to go but we said no. He led them before they came and tried to unleash mayhem, but we thank God that our people were also good in number and they were chased away,\u201d he said.\n\nPower sector under threat\n\nBut the workers had threatened to escalate the power outage nationwide by Friday, if governors failed to advise El-Rufai to dialogue with the workers.\n\nSpeaking, a Deputy President of NLC and General Secretary of Nigeria Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), Comrade Ajaero, said the power blackout would go national from Friday, if the situation remains the same and El-Rufai refused to do the needful.\n\n\u201cThe NLC had warned earlier that if after the five-day warning strike, the state governor failed to address the issues, workers across the country would join in solidarity and commence a nationwide strike.\n\n\u201cThey said we are declared wanted and we are in the streets of Kaduna. Let me make this clear, there is decision of power \u2013 the executive, the judiciary and the legislator.\n\n\u201cNo Executive governor can declare anybody wanted. The police can do that, the courts can give order. Any executive Governor that is announcing that doesn\u2019t know his job, there is separation of powers between the three arms of Government so in furtherance to the illegality being perpetrated by El-Rufai , is the power of the police and the court to declare someone wanted .\n\n\u201cNow, El-Rufai is an illegal governor all his actions and pronouncements are embedded in illegality so we are here the action is on, the strike is on. Rather than go into issue of negotiation, he has resulted to harassment and intimidation. Last night he tried to use force to enter power installation to install power. Let me say this under the Constitution- Sections 1&2 made it clear the supremacy of the constitution.\n\nSection 40 gives us freedom movement, freedom of association as well as freedom to protest and we are not going to violate any law.\n\n\u201cWe are going to perform our trade union function to the best of our knowledge. And for your information, power is under the exclusive list; el Rufai has no business to say anything about power. The state government is under concurrent list. So, everyone should mind his powers. Comrades, I want to urge all of you to stay firm. So, for some of us in the power sector, if by tomorrow or next nothing happens, we are ready to escalate it to the whole country, we want to send a message to the chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) that if they don\u2019t advise El-Rufai on this issue, they would feel also the power outage.\u201d\n\nThe peaceful rally which commenced as usual from the NLC state secretariat where the workers were earlier addressed by the NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, and passed through the secretariat through to the popular NEPA Junction along Ahmadu Bello Way, before the thugs arrived in two small buses, jumped down with sticks to confront the Labour leaders.\n\nBlueprint reports that as a t the time of this report, the Kaduna metropolis still remained deserted with all businesses under lock and key.\n\nAPC govs beg\n\nAnd from the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) came a plea that Governor El-Rufai should negotiate with the striking workers.\n\nChairman of the forum and governor of Kebbi state, Abubakar Bagudu, made the plea in a statement Tuesday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe PGF has been following unfolding development between NLC and Kaduna State government over the issue of rightsizing local government employees with deep concerns.\n\n\u201cNoting all the challenges facing all our states, especially given dwindling revenue, we appeal to all patriotic Nigerians, including the NLC, to demonstrate more commitment toward engaging governments at all levels to address problems.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for muscle-flexing,\u201d Mr Bagudu said, saying Nigerians were already overstretched with many challenges.\n\n\u201cAt this critical point of our democratic journey, there could not be limits to engagement between all governments and citizens.\u201d\n\nHe said that every step must be taken to resolve the face-off between the state government and NLC.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to NLC leadership to recognise that the burden of leadership is more about responding to challenges based on the honest disposition of correcting past mistakes.\n\n\u201cAs progressive governors, we share the vision of Kaduna State government of reforming all our local government councils to make them more efficient and consequently the pivot of critical development initiatives.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we want to appeal to the state government under the leadership of our colleague, Malam Nasir El-Rufai to take all necessary steps to ensure the resolution of all disagreements in the larger interest of citizens in Kaduna state,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bagudu expressed confidence that both the state government and NLC would resolve all outstanding issues and restore industrial harmony in the state.\n\nNAN\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "2021 budget deficit: Buhari seeks NASS\u2019 nod to raise N2.343trn loan",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded to the National Assembly a request for an approval to raise the sum of N2, 343,387,942,848 trillion from multilateral and bilateral lenders, to finance the deficit of N5.602 trillion in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe amount which is equivalent to USD$6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD$1/N379, is captured as part of the N4.666 trillion External Borrowing plans proposed and approved through the passage of the N13.8 trillion 2021 budget.\n\nThe request was contained in a letter addressed to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker House of Representatives, and read during plenary.\n\nAccording to the president, the request was made in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment) Act, 2003.\n\nHe disclosed that Nigeria may be able to raise USD$3 billion or more in a combination of tenors between 5-30 years.\n\nBuhari explained that the federal government\u2019s decision to raise the sum from the International Capital Market was due to the recent monetary policy stance that provides for very low interest rates and ease of moderating debt service cost.\n\nHe further disclosed that the proceeds of the USD6.183 billion (N2.343 trillion New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act) would be used to fund specific Capital Projects in the Budget.\n\nThe president said such projects were captured in priority sectors of the economy, namely: Power, Transportation, Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Health, Provision of Counterpart Funding for Multilateral and Bilateral projects, Defence and Water Resources.\n\nThe letter reads : \u201cRequest For the Resolution of the National Assembly For: The Implementation of the New External Borrowing of N2.343 trillion (about USD6.183 Billion) In the 2022 Appropriation Act\u201d, reads in part:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this Letter is to request for a Resolution of the National Assembly (NASS) to raise the sum of N2, 343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) provided as New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the Budget Deficit of N5.602 trillion.\n\n\u201cThis request is in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act). Section 21(1) of the DMO states that \u201cno external loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its Resolution\u201d; while Section 27(1) states that the National Assembly may by a resolution approve, from time to time, standard terms and conditions for the negotiation and acceptance of external loans and issuance of guarantees.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as New Borrowings(Item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 Fiscal Deficit, of Which 50% or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about USD 6,183,081,643.40 at the Budget Exchange Rate of USD1.00/N379) is specified as New External Borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Senate may also wish to note that the allocation of #2.343 trillion to New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with the Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and to free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers\u201d\n\nThe President in another letter to the Senate, requested for concurrent approval of donor-funded projects under the 2018 \u2013 2020 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan.\n\nIn the letter, President Buhari further explained that the projects listed under the 2018 \u2013 2020 External Borrowing Plan, are to be financed through Sovereign loans from the World Bank , African Development Bank (AfDB) , French Development Agency ( AFD) , Islamic Development Bank , China EXIMBank etc , at a total sum of $36.837billion and 910, 000,000million Euro.\n\n\u2018Request ill-timed\u2019\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions to the president\u2019s decision were divergent, with some saying it\u2019s ill-timed while others said it was in order.\n\nFor Managing Director/CEO SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade, the federal government\u2019s request for additional borrowing of $6.18 billion to finance the 2021 budget deficit is not healthy for the economy at the moment \u201ctaking into cognisance the difficulty we are experiencing in loan repayments due to reductions in revenue accruing to the Federation account.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with one of our correspondents, Gbolade noted that the \u201ccycle of borrowing will further sink the country in more debt with no clear cut strategy effective enough to service loan repayments.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s borrowing to fund infrastructural projects should have been designed in a way that the projects funded will repay the loans which is not the case, leaving us with dwindling revenues from oil and non-oil sectors to fund loan repayments with other government obligations.\n\n\u201cThe request by the president is ill timed as further borrowings will have a strain on our capacity to meet up with expectations of the people and will further add more economic hardship in the long run.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s in order but\u2026\u2019\n\nIn his view, a public affairs commentator, Engr. Godwin Ubochi, the president\u2019s request is in order.\n\nAccording to him, the spending plan of the president at last year\u2019s budget presentation before the National Assembly was an indication that Nigeria would borrow to fund its budget.\n\nHe said: \u201cI maintain that there is nothing wrong in borrowing for capital projects that are self- liquidating. My worry is that Nigeria borrowed so much in the past without anything to show for it. Corruption in government, lack of transparency and accountability, inefficiency, incompetence and lack of capacity in governance and financial prudence are Nigeria\u2019s undoing in loan management. The management of this loan is not expected to be any different because nothing has changed in our government system. If anything, corruption level is much higher.\n\n\u201cWith a shortfall in government revenue in the midst of a pandemic, it will be difficult to carry on without loan, which should be the last resort after the government has done the needful from within. There is a lot of stealing and wastage in government. Until this is taken care of, further borrowing will lead to a deeper economic crisis.\u201d\n\nAlso a political economist and development researcher, Adefolarin A. Olamilekan, told Blueprint that Nigerians should not be too surprised as borrowing was becoming a characteristic of the present administration.\n\nHe added that continuous dependence on oil was making it difficult to get other sources of funding the country\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a surprise going by the character of the Nigerian state and the structure of its economy. First, it\u2019s a dependent, de-industrialized economy that is import-driven. Secondly, it runs and survives as a mono-cultural petro dollar and rentier state for revenue. Regrettably, since 1999 the annual budget of the country has always fallen into the prevailing circumstance of borrowing to cover up for the budget deficit, even when we earned so much from crude. Our economic managers still find reasons to borrow. Obtrusively, it\u2019s crystal clear that the 2021 budget is facing an implementation issue.\u201d\n\nTo escape the urge for more borrowing, Olamilekan, said government officials must come up with creative ways of tackling the country\u2019s economic challenges\n\n\u201cOne is obliged to as a matter of concern for objectivity and national interest, avoid the altar of selfishness. Moreover, a desired policy to address the country\u2019s budget deficit cum economic challenges is not farfetched if the government is serious, especially as present opportunities for creative solutions abound with us. Fundamentally, the Nigeria state must tackle loopholes and gap that have created corruption among revenue generation agencies abusing funds generated by under-declaration and false accounts. Also, the government should align its industrialisation policy on the foundation of sustainable economy revamp,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",
