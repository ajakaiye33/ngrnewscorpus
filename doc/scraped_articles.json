The customs men are supposed to be about 40kms to the border town\n\n\u201cIf these men had been properly cautioned and trained in the process of recruiting them, bearing in mind that they carry arms, these tragedies would have been avoided. Killings by Customs officers in the guise of pursuing smugglers are a recurring saga in the country and something must be done urgently to put an end to it.\n\n\u201cRelevant questions must be asked: are bags of rice worth more than human lives? Even if they were smugglers, must the Customs officers open fire on them? Must they pursue smugglers? These and many more questions need to be asked to forestall a future occurrence\u201d, Peller said.\n\nAdopting the motion, they gave the committee 6 weeks within which to Investigate the matter and report back to it for further legislative action.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

We are looking to deploy air surveillance across the state in terms of using drones, we can also collaborate in this area, as we see security as an important part of our administration,\u201d Abiodun added.\n\nHe disclosed that his administration was awaiting the donation of about six ambulances before the end of the week, saying his administration is also waiting patiently for the Czech government to deliver on its promise to donate ambulances to the state.\n\n\u201cWe are anxiously waiting for those ambulances you promised us. When we assumed office, there were only five ambulances in the state, today, we have twenty ambulances. I think somebody else is donating about maybe five, six ambulances sometimes this week, so, we have about twenty-six. We aim to have about thirty-five to forty ambulances because we want to have one ambulance per state constituency and we have twenty-six of such constituencies.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is to provide enough ambulances to make that operational, we are providing ambulances in the primary health care centers, tricycle ambulances for pregnant women in that neighbourhood, we are rehabilitating the centers so that they give our people the confidence. At the end of this month, we should have about a hundred of those in place, which is about five per local government, we are hoping to do two-hundred and thirty-six between now and the end of next year.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that once we have our Primary Health Care Centers in place, we can launch our health care Insurance Programme as well,\u201d Abiodun submitted.\n\nAlso speaking, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, commended the Czech Republic government for its numerous support to the state.\n\nShe disclosed that the medical equipment would be installed in Ijebu-Ife, one of the local communities visited by Ambassador Skolil.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

These things are to secure Nigerians and their properties. So, why are the terrorists having more sophisticated weapons? Is it that they are richer than the country? We want to know. Tell us.\n\n\u201cBy the time we look at your documents, interact with you, and probably realize we made a mistake in the appointment of the former service chiefs, we can recommend to the Executive and say as chief of army staff you must have this experience and so on. All we are looking at is how to curb these problems we have. It\u2019s everywhere. We call it Boko Haram, IPOB, banditry and whatever name. It is everywhere.

          "text": "The Bayelsa State Panel of Inquiry sitting in Yenagoa, has ordered the authorities of the Nigeria Police to pay the family of late Victor Ezekwueme whom the police ordered to jumped into the river at gun point the sum of one hundred million naira (N100,000,000) as damage.\n\nJustice Young Ogola, delivered the ruling on Tuesday during a sitting at the Seisei Ikoli Press Centre Secretariat in Yenagoa.\n\nThe ruling also confirmed the earlier judgement by the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa.\n\nNarrating the ordeal of the deceased, the elder brother, Mr. Tochukwu Uzoukwu, said his sibling was ordered to jump into the river by the dreaded police team at gun point without knowing how to swim.\n\nAccording to him, he was actually out of town when a police officer named Sergeant Benjamin Ogbuagwu called him that he has arrested his brother and that its an opportunity for him to eat his money but begged the officer to release his brother that he will come and settle him when he returns, but refused.\n\nHe said from eyewitness account, his brother was brought to his shop and asked to show them the place where he was smoking his Indian hemp and the boy showed them the back of the toilet where he was smoking and not satisfied with the boy\u2019s answer, they asked him to climb a floating jetty at gun point and ordered him to jump into the river.\n\n\u201cThe eyewitness said all the boy\u2019s pleas fell on deaf ears even when the boy told them that he doesn\u2019t know how to swim, yet they pushed him into the river where they watched him struggle for life till he died and they left.\u201d\n\nThe corpse was recovered four days later and deposited in the mortuary.\n\nMr. Tochukwu thanked the federal and the state governments as well as the panel of Inquiry for upholding the judgement of the Federal High Court, which had initially awarded a fine of hundred million naira to the family.\n\nIn another ruling, a young man that was ran over by a police vehicle while driving on one-way within the state capital, and was hospitalized for six months before he died due to police abandonment over refusal to pay N3.5 million for surgery and medical bills.\n\nThe presiding Justice also ordered the police authority to pay #16million compensation to the family. According to him, N3 million for hospital expenses, #3 million for burial arrangements while #10 million is to be paid to the family.\n\nThe petitioner, Mr. Joseph Oghene, thanked the panel and also appealed to the authority concern to respond without delay.\n\nWhile the third case was on Nigerian Army that arrested and detained one Prince Fubara while playing football at Abua County School field since 14th October 2018.\n\nAccording to family member, Mr. Francis Oporo, said they have tried all they could but to know avail as Nigerian army still hold the young man in their custody without telling them the offence he committed.\n\n\u201cThe young man was arrested by Joint Task Force (JTF) and was taken to Abua Command and later to Bori-Camp and they have refused to tell us the offence he committed.\u201d\n\nMr. Francis said they thanked the panel chairman and members for the judgement as the panel asked the Nigerian Army to pay the family the sum of N10 million naira for unlawful detention and maltreatment and also ordered them to release prince Fubara unconditionally.\n\nThe last was an ongoing case of late Tarila Adamu, who was allegedly shot dead by a trigger-happy police officer at Arietalin, Ovom in Yenagoa, the state capital by officer Udu Udoh Ubang last year at about 5:pm.\n\nNarrating the ugly experience, the father of the deceased, Engr. Adamu Mabinton, said on that fateful evening, he sent his son on an errand with his girlfriend when they met some SARS officers that have already gunned down one young man.\n\nHe said his son confronted them and asked them why were they killing innocent people that if the young man was a criminal they should have taken him to police station instead of wasting his life and the officer took offence and him shot dead.\n\nAccording to him, after killing the boy, they claimed he exchange bullets with them and put his cell phone on his chest claiming he was an armed robber and they also came up with forged document that he had signed an affidavits that his son was an armed robber.\n\n\u201cMy son was not an armed robber, he was a final year student of Electrical\\Electronics Engineering in Benin Republic. That was my only son, as I am talking to you, I don\u2019t have another son. They just killed him for no reason and tagged him as an armed robber.\n\n\u201cHe came home last year due to the COVID-19 and was killed July that same last year. Since then, I have tried to seek for justice but they kept on bribing my lawyer from the first to second and this is the third lawyer and I have confidence in this one because he is a sincere person.\u201d",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Abuja\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has argued the constitutional provision in Section 121(3), guaranteeing financial autonomy for the Judiciary and Legislature at the state level was a non-negotiable right exercisable by both arms of government.\n\nMalami faulted the arguments that queried the constitutionality of the Executive Order 10 issued by President Muhammadu Buhari to further the implementation of the provision of Section 121(3, contending that the presidential initiative was \u201cdesigned and intended to give enforcement spirit to the autonomy provision.\u201d\n\nHe said Governors were not averse to enforcement of the constitutional provision on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary but the seeming disagreement was in relation to the modality to be adopted in its application, which was currently being worked out in the series of engagements that are being held.\n\nMalami, who spoke while featuring on Tuesday on a morning programme on the government-owned Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), said: \u201cGenerally speaking, the operation, application and enforcement of laws are a process. With particular reward to the Executive Order, you have to into account the antecedence. One, there exists a constitutional amendment, with particular regard to Section121 (3) of the Constitution that initiated the process.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the constitutional amendment, we equally have in place, the Executive Order 10, signed by the President. Which, in effect, is designed and intended to give enforcement spirit to the autonomy as contained in Section 121(3).\n\n\u201cArising therefrom, there were contentions, particularly on the part of the governors as to the application and operation of the provision of Section 121(3) and the Executive Order. And you have, in that respect, an implementation committee, among others. On the side of the implementation committee, there have been series of engagements, which are ongoing. I think, as a process, we are evolving.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNobody is contending about the constitutional amendment having been in place. Nobody is equally contending about the need for the Executive Order.\n\n\u201cNobody is contenting about the fact that there exists the political will on the part of the Executive, in particular, the President, about the implementation of the autonomy of the Judiciary and the Legislature. But then, perhaps, the limited engagements is about the modalities.\n\n\u201cSo, against the background of these processes that are unfolding, I think the process is indeed, evolving and we are certainly getting there.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the Executive Order has been in place, the legislative processes associated with its implementation are in place, and I think the engagement is a product of such process that will eventually see to the implementation, enforcement and application of the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nOn whether the financial autonomy provisions could be successfully implemented at the state level under a federal system of government, Malami insisted that there was no excuse to escape its implementation at the state level, because an example already exists at the federal level.\n\nREAD ALSO: Bello backs financial autonomy for states legislatures\n\nLast week, a constitutional lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Sebatine Hon, in a letter to the AGF, Chief Justice of Nigeria(CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad and other stakeholders in the nation\u2019s justice sector argued that Executive Order 10 was illegal.\n\nHon argued that the \u201cExecutive Order 10 is also in conflict with the express provisions of Sections 6(1), (3)(5) read together with sections 81(3) and 84(1)(4)(7) of the Constitution. It indeed runs counter to the very section 121(3) as amended, since, as against the wrong notion held by Mr President, neither the original text of that subsection nor its amended version has anything to do with superior courts of records, even though located in the various states and acting as state courts.\u201d\n\nHon added that under \u201cthe Presidential cum Federal Constitution of Nigeria, the states are semi-autonomous, hence the President has no power, direct or implied, to force down orders on the governors or to attempt, as was done in Executive Order 10 to run the states from Abuja or to create some bodies that will run those states (as in the case of the Presidential Implementation Committee created in the said Executive Order 10\n\n\u201cThe presidential Order 10 signed by Buhari on May 20, 2020, is unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect, it being in conflict with the express provisions of the 1999 Constitution,\u201d he said.",

There will be a handsome reward! \u2014 Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai (@elrufai) May 18, 2021\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Government has said that the conditions that compelled its decision to rightsize staff strength have not been altered by the NLC\u2019s campaign of economic and social sabotage.\n\nAccording to Special Adviser to the Governor (Media & Communication) Muyiwa Adekeye, \u2018KDSG remains firmly committed to using all the resources it can generate to serve the interests of the majority of its citizens, putting the many ahead of the few. The unlawful actions and reckless statements that define the NLC\u2019s assault on the rights of the people of Kaduna State, are a needless exercise in futility.\n\n\u2018Desperate actions undertaken by the NLC today include unlawful trespass on government facilities, and attempts to prevent officers from signing attendance registers.\n\n\u2018Despite these actions, the state government has guaranteed access to the State Secretariat and other government offices. KDSG intends to continue running its operations in the service to the people, despite the futile efforts of the NLC to impede it.\n\n\u2018The State Executive Council also held its regular weekly meeting to discuss policy matters germane to the progress of the state and the welfare of its people.\n\n\u2018In addition to shutting down electricity, the NLC has also shut healthcare access for several of our citizens. They have closed several hospitals and chased away the patients. General hospitals in Kawo, Tudun-Wada, Kafanchan, Giwa, Rigasa, Kakuri and Sabon Tasha were illegally locked. They also shut rural hospitals and primary health centres in Kwoi, Turunku and other locations across the state. Preventing patients from receiving treatment in public health facilities certainly does not qualify as a pro-people action.\n\n\u2018The State Government is documenting all these violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act. The government shares the pain of the people of Kaduna State amidst the avalanche of unlawful conduct by the NLC and appeals to all residents to remain calm and vigilant. The resort to coercion and the imposition of restraints on the personal freedom and comfort of citizens confirm that this is a campaign of sabotage, not an industrial action.\n\n\u2018KDSG welcomes the visit by the leaders of the Trade Union Congress who met with our Head of Service, Bariatu Y Mohammed, this morning. Hajiya Bariatu commended the constructive attitude of the TUC delegation led by Barrister Musa Lawal, its Secretary-General. The Head of Service also disclosed that all officers from GL 14 upwards are expected at their duty posts as usual.\u2019",

The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages. To this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\n\n\u201cThe meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\nThe meeting also thanked Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State \u201cfor being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South West Zone, to ensure that PDP takes over majority of the states in the Zone.\n\nApart from Makinde and Tambuwal, the PDP governors that were also in attendance are the vice chairman of the forum and Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu; Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Duoye For (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Godwin Onadeko (Edo), and Nyesom Wike (Rivers). Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State was represented by his deputy, Mahdi Mohd.\n\nMeanwhile, the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that it did not come to him as a surprise hearing the governors, under the umbrella of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), describing the APC-led government as rudderless and incompetent.\n\nIn a reaction to the communique the PDP governors issued after their meeting, in Ibadan, yesterday, the former Edo State governor said that having deployed the same format to remove them from office, they are just paying the APC in their own coins.",

That is an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act and we want him, we will bring him to justice.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for him, he should report to the nearest police station or report to us. He will be prosecuted for economic sabotage,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that there is no ground for any compromise with the NLC, insisting that the labour union has used its last ultimate weapon and he will not change his position.\n\n\u201cThere is no grounds for compromise. They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything. We will not change our position,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nReacting, the NLC President, Wabba, said he is waiting for the governor to arrest him. Speaking while while leading a peaceful procession by workers on Tuesday in Kaduna, Wabba said the issue is not about him but about workers, adding that: \u201cWe are here and waiting for him to come and arrest us.

Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the PDP governors called on Buhari to immediately send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the constitution to devolve more powers to the states to enable governors to effectively manage security in their domains, especially through the establishment of a state policing system and developing their own internal security arrangements.\n\nThey said: \u201cIn the interim, Mr. President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr. President and all state governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that the police force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and recently by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to states; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the six-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors enjoined all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and other cleavages.\n\nTambuwal said the meeting called on the \u201cincompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\nHe added that the meeting reiterated the earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\n\nThe PDP governors thanked their host and colleague in Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmarks developmental projects he has executed.\n\nThey urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South-west to ensure that PDP takes over the majority of the states in the zone.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were Tambuwal; Governors Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State; Douye Diri of Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Seyi Makinde Oyo State; Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State; Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Mohammed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Acumen\u2019s patient capital is providing investment alternatives for companies tackling poverty",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nIn 2017, Sanmi Lajuwomi identified a problem with the solar leasing space in Nigeria.\n\nOptimistic that it was worth further investigation, he pooled his personal funds and that of a high-net-worth individual in the UK, and undertook a two-year pilot study. At the end of the study, he had a better understanding of the customers and the challenges of running a business in Nigeria. He returned to Nigeria in 2019.\n\nLajuwomi\u2019s company Winnock began by leasing solar equipment which could save small businesses up to 70% on electricity costs. The company has since added other productive use equipment such as sewing machines, fridges and freezers.\n\nIn 2019, they raised funds from some investors and got connected to Acumen. Impressed by what they saw, Acumen started a conversation with them.\n\nIn March 2020, the pandemic brought a lot of uncertainty for the young startup of 10 people. Surprisingly, Lajuwomi got a call from Acumen, they hadn\u2019t concluded the due diligence process but in the light of recent happenings, they made him an offer of a $50,000 grant or convertible debt.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the loan was disbursed and Winnock was able to retain 100% of its staff without a salary reduction. Later in the year, Acumen invested in Winnock.\n\nAcumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives. Its first appearance in Africa was in 2006 when its Kenyan office was set up, while its Lagos office was later created in 2012.\n\nOver the years, it has invested across West African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone and East African countries like Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Collectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\n\nMy first contact with Acumen was through their Acumen Academy online courses. In July 2018, I took their Storytelling for Change course. For a long time, I had thought Acumen was an education company, and that was the starting point of my conversation with Meghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Why these courses?\n\nMeghan Curran: We started with a physical leadership development program, our West Africa fellows program. From that program, we started to think about how we could teach some of those skills to a broader audience so that people working on social change problems anywhere, could access these different pieces of content that would strengthen their work.\n\nThat\u2019s how the online courses came about. We started the online courses in 2012/2013 and to date have had more than 500,000 people participate in courses around the world in over 193 countries. The curriculum has expanded to include more courses asides leadership. The objective of these courses is to just help social entrepreneurs we may end up eventually investing in someday or generally help build other entrepreneurs who want to build their own skills.\n\nDA: Now that we\u2019re clear Acumen is not just an education company, What does Acumen do?\n\nMC: The original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. The best of both of those worlds is what we now call the patient capital approach. What that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\n\nOnce we make that investment, we\u2019re often doing equity deals and holding our position in a company for a number of years. When we exit our stake in the company that capital is returned to us. In a typical investment fund that returned capital would go back to the investors who had put money in and they would earn their returns.\n\nIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen and we redeploy it and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\n\nThe second thing that\u2019s really important is that we also have flexibility in terms of returns. Most investment funds have a specific return target that they\u2019re committed to achieving, because we\u2019re not returning capital to our investors, we\u2019re just trying to recover exactly what we put in. We have somewhat moderated return expectations, and this enables our entrepreneurs to really stay focused on the social objectives that they\u2019re trying to achieve without being forced, either to do something like pursue growth at all costs, and to hit exponential scale overnight.\n\nDA: How do you pick the companies you invest in?\n\nMC: Over the last couple of years in West Africa, we\u2019ve been focused primarily on renewable energy and agriculture. In both instances, we\u2019re looking for companies that have been operational anywhere from two to five years and have demonstrated a track record and revenue growth.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be profitable at the time we invest. In fact, most of them are not. There has to be a path to profitability where we can see where the break-even point is and where they will become profitable. I would say the thing that\u2019s consistent across any of the companies we look at is really wanting to get to know the entrepreneur. The assessment of the entrepreneur or the founding team is on two or three different levels. The first is values alignment. We\u2019re not trying to impose Acumen\u2019s mission or social objectives on an entrepreneur. We want to find entrepreneurs who, independent of Acumen, are interested in creating the same type of impact we want to see. Obviously, a significant percentage of their customer base has to be individuals living below the poverty line.\n\nThe second piece is the operational and technical capacity of the entrepreneur or the founding team. This means that they have done their homework on the industry or the sector that they\u2019re working in. It\u2019s sometimes reflected in the strength of the team that they have around them.\n\nDA: What are the sectors you\u2019re focused on?\n\nMC: The last couple of years we\u2019ve been really focused on renewable energy and agriculture. We\u2019re really starting to shift our impact definition to be inclusive of other sectors or business models.\n\nWe are asking ourselves how we look at transportation, waste management or light manufacturing, sectors that are often employing large numbers of low-income individuals and where they can make adjustments to their business models, to ensure that the jobs they\u2019re providing pay a living wage or create some kind of social safety net.\n\nDA: In your world of patient capital, How long does it take to do due diligence?\n\nMC: It really depends on how prepared the company is when we meet them and where they are in their stage of development. For our due diligence, It\u2019s just really about understanding the business model, understanding what their growth projections are and what some of those underlying assumptions are. That can take a month or two. Our more formal diligence where we\u2019re out doing these other interviews, conducting site visits, talking to customers, suppliers, other investors that you may have. Also doing our own kind of market research and market landscaping to make sure things all add up.\n\nThat can take another month or two. Once we get the investment approved there\u2019s documentation and that\u2019s where the lawyers come in and we\u2019re negotiating the details of the terms. From when we first meet you to when we make the investment, I would say six to nine months.\n\nMeghan Curran of Acumen Fund visit to PIND Foundation, Warri Office\n\nDA: What does a typical investment from you look like?\n\nMC: We do anything from $200,000 to $500,000 as the first investment.\n\nI would say there\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned along the way. When we started out, we didn\u2019t expect that if we could help these companies achieve scale, that there would be a long line of other investors waiting to follow us, but that there would be an availability of secondary capital that would enable us to exit. What we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s challenging for a couple of reasons. The markets we operate in are still in some ways underdeveloped such that most investors that are coming in, want to see their cash go to grow the company, not to buy existing investors.\n\nThe second piece is that we find that some of our entrepreneurs actually really value having Acumen as a board member to help protect that social objective. They sometimes don\u2019t want us to leave even when there\u2019s an opportunity. This is challenging and in a good way, but still challenging. What we\u2019ve started to do, with some of our more recent investments to address this, is to experiment with different investment instruments that enable us to have a clearer path to liquidity. In a recent investment we did in Sierra Leone, we actually structured it as a self-liquidating equity instrument where I think after a six or seven year period, the company has the opportunity to buy back shares from Acumen. In this way, the ownership stake eventually stays with the entrepreneurs and with the company, we have a path to some capital recovery, and yet in the short term, it\u2019s equity financing, that gives them the freedom and wiggle room to do what they need to do in the short to medium term.\n\nIn general, we end up holding our investments anywhere between seven to ten, sometimes up to 12 years, but we are trying to be creative about how we structure those investments to reduce, or to shorten that time horizon.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other \u2018traditional\u2019 investors considering the fact that there\u2019s only so much an impact fund can do?\n\nMC: I think we really see ourselves as a feeder to some of those more traditional investors. In the version of the world where everything goes according to plan, we\u2019re investing in some of these companies still at a relatively early stage. We\u2019re often the first institutional investor that they\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re able to accompany them to hit a certain growth trajectory or a certain level of maturity and scale, that\u2019s when they then become more attractive to some of those more commercial or traditional investors. We really see ourselves as helping build that pipeline of investments. What we see in West Africa is that there is a decent number of equity investors that are looking for investments where they want to put in a million or $3 million. Some even start at $5 million and there aren\u2019t that many companies that can absorb that type of capital.\n\nDA: How do companies find you or you find companies you invest in?\n\nMC: It\u2019s definitely a mix. We participate in the startup ecosystem. We go to different business plan competitions or industry events. We\u2019ve partnered with a couple of other earlier-stage investors to try to get to know and develop the pipeline.\n\nThrough our fellowship program and through our online courses as well. What we\u2019re really focused on in this coming year is continuing to push our footprint beyond Lagos and Abuja. We really want to go out to some of the other cities in Nigeria and be able to generate and develop a pipeline that\u2019s beyond the usual suspects.\n\nA session at The East Africa Acumen fellows program\n\nDA: What is a notable investment for you?\n\nMC: d.light which we first invested in 2007. The founders of that company from the beginning were really keen on developing a product or a suite of products that will be affordable for low-income consumers. They didn\u2019t develop the first solar panel but what they did was take a $20/25 product and push it down to be a $5 product. From there came solar home systems and now we\u2019re getting into solar appliances and not that they were the only company, but they were definitely one of the first movers and one of the early companies to really see low-income communities as a market.\n\nWe ended up making five different investments in delight over a 10 year period. We\u2019ve now partially exited and the company I think has served 80 million customers around the world. Not all of them in Africa, but a significant concentration. That\u2019s definitely one of our success stories.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging. The response to that has been some of these more creative financing instruments, whether it\u2019s doing revenue-based financing or these other self-liquidating instruments.\n\nAnother trend, which I think is a little more unfortunate is that the impact investing landscape has become pretty crowded with impact investors that are looking for market-ratemarket rate returns. At that point, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish the impact funds from the commercial funds. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself because I do think there are business models that have fewer trade-offs between impact and returns.\n\nDA: See trends in terms of sectors?\n\nMC: All of a sudden everyone is doing something that\u2019s agritech. Although there\u2019s a lot an app can do, there\u2019s also a lot more, particularly when you\u2019re working with small farmers, that is always going to be offline.\n\nWe look at agritech companies and we\u2019re really trying to evaluate what are their tech capabilities, as well as their offline capabilities? In some instances, offline is the harder part of the work. I think entrepreneurs need to have an awareness that tech should enable your solution, but it can\u2019t always be \u2013 it won\u2019t always be \u2013 the full solution.\n\nDA: Which Acumen courses would you recommend?\n\nMC: I would say the adaptive leadership course. Adaptive leadership is a framework to help think through problems that are complex with no known solution. On the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data. I think a lot of social entrepreneurs know in their head what they\u2019re trying to do in terms of the impact that they want to see, but being able to quantify it is a challenge.",
          "summary": "Acumen is an early-stage non-profit impact fund that invests in companies whose products and services enable the poor to transform their lives.\nCollectively, it has invested over $40million in African companies and its operations in Africa account for about 30% of Acumen\u2019s global footprint.\nWhat that means is that Acumen takes money from different donor agencies and foundations and makes investments in these early stage companies tackling problems of poverty.\nMC: As I mentioned earlier, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the only impact investors that have seen that exits in these markets are more challenging.\nOn the technical side, I\u2019ll recommend social impact analysis and lean data.",

          "text": "In March, Nigerian startup Termii raised $1.4 million in a seed round. Future Africa co-led the round with Kepple Africa Ventures, a Japanese Africa-focused venture capital firm.\n\nIt is not clear how much Future Africa invested in Termii but the firm can invest up to $500,000 in deals, thanks to the Future Africa Collective, its community of angel investors.\n\nIt turns out Future Africa has done a dozen other deals since. Other investments this year have been in Kenyan startups Lami and Ongair, as well as in Stitch, a South African company building APIs for open banking.\n\nThe firm says it has invested $3 million in 13 startups in the first five months of 2021. By doing so, they have doubled their 2020 performance in dollar terms.\n\nFuture Africa invested $1.2 million in 14 startups in 2020. They returned $3.7 million to some of the firm\u2019s first limited partners after profitably exiting some legacy positions through secondaries.\n\nFuture Africa has now made 47 investments as a fund. Launched in 2020, the firm operates an institutional venture capital fund (\u201cFuture Africa Fund\u201d) and a subscription-based syndicate composed of Africa-focused angel investors (\u201cFuture Africa Collective\u201d).\n\nMembers of the Future Africa Collective pay $1,000 annually for the opportunity to invest a minimum of $5,000 per deal. Future Africa Fund alone invests a maximum of $50,000 per deal.\n\nOlabinjo Adeniran, a Future Africa co-founder, said members of the Future Africa Collective will have access to 20 deals in 2021. These 20 will be part of 100 startup investments that the Future Africa Fund plans to make this year.\n\nSeen in that light, it looks like Future Africa is behind schedule with 13 investments after four months. Adeniran confirms that not all 13 investments have been offered to members of the Collective, so the firm is also behind on the 20-startup target.\n\nBut \u201cwe think we are going to exceed the target number on both ends,\u201d Adeniran says to TechCabal.\n\nFuture Africa chose not to disclose the 9 other investments it has made because the startups have not announced the funding. But they did drop a few hints:\n\nTwo digital banks: one for financial organisations transacting between Africa and the UK; the other for African migrants.\n\n\u201cA pharmaceutical startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to solve the drug counterfeiting problem in Africa\u201d\n\nA startup that \u201chelps businesses create flexible virtual and physical cards for multiple purposes\u201d which might be Sudo (Adeniran declined to confirm or deny).\n\nFuture Africa\u2019s initial investments were centered around Nigerian startups like 54Gene, Bamboo and Eden, but the firm is taking a more pan-African outlook. Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa are now represented on the firm\u2019s portfolio map.\n\nBeyond the appeal of building a pan-African suite of investments, Future Africa hopes to fund more women-led startups. At the beginning of the year, the firm set out to invest $1 million in women-led startups.\n\nIt appears Future Africa has met that milestone, though no details are provided about the women-led startups. We know Lami, one of the new investments, is co-founded and led by a woman \u2013 Jihan Abass.\n\nFuture Africa plans to fund more women-led startups, pushing past the initial $1 million goal.\n\n\u201cWe are going to announce some new structures soon that will enable us move even faster and invest in more startups,\u201d Adeniran says. \u201cIt should be ready within the next 3 months.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside Klasha\u2019s mission to help 5,000 global retailers sell and ship to Africa",
          "text": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the first week of May, the eve of Klasha\u2019s public launch. Jessica Anuna is showing me a demo of a customer adding items to a cart in an online store, filling in billing details and paying through Klasha.\n\nA few seconds later, her phone beeps with an email notification that her demo order has been placed, with a receipt attached for proof.\n\nAnuna exudes the relief and excitement of a founder and CEO who has built an e-commerce payments product from scratch after nearly three years. Klasha is her solution for global merchants looking to serve Africa\u2019s increasingly digitally native consumers.\n\n\u201cWith Klasha, merchants would not have to open individual country stores. They can now make their existing global e-commerce stores Africa friendly,\u201d Anuna says.\n\nThe business case\n\nOpening individual country stores is a secondary headache. For merchants who want to sell in Africa, the first problem is setting up country-by-country payment connections.\n\nTo do this well, these merchants have to be present on the ground and do some dreary work, like managing currency conversions themselves.\n\nKlasha Checkout essentially absorbs all of that responsibility into one payment gateway. Hear Anuna explain how Klasha manages exchange rate fluctuations:\n\n\u201cAt the time the customer pays for the item, the exchange rate is locked in. That way, we are able to remit the equivalent value to the merchant. In the merchant\u2019s dashboard, they can opt to pay themselves out at different exchange rates.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to payments, Klasha\u2019s e-commerce feature includes a logistics service. This service is built to convince high-growth brands, doing above $20 million in gross merchandise value, that Africa is a destination to take seriously.\n\nHer pitch is that when a merchant sets up a Klasha Checkout option on their website, Africans will more readily purchase items in their local currencies. Ghanaians pay with mobile money. Kenyans pay with M-Pesa. Nigerians can pay with Naira bank cards.\n\nBundling logistics and payments\n\nAt the moment, Anuna says they have retailers from the US, UK, the Middle East, and some conversations are ongoing with retailers in Japan. Their focus is on retailers selling fast-moving consumer goods that are not perishable \u2013 clothes, shoes, bags and electronics.\n\nKlasha will make revenue by taking commissions on sales and offering subscriptions to merchants, especially for add-ons like analytics. In exchange, the startup helps merchants collect payments from and ship directly to African buyers\u2019 doorsteps in no more than 9 working days.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous promise, especially the logistics aspect. Klasha is primarily a payments company. To fulfil deliveries, they will be partnering with two different logistics companies; the first brings the merchant\u2019s goods into Africa while the second delivers to the customer\u2019s door. In Nigeria, Anuna says they are ready to deliver to every local government area.\n\nWhy is a young startup burdening itself with this complexity, knowing how poor road infrastructure in Nigeria hampers efficient logistics?\n\nAlthough she held back details of Klasha\u2019s logistics, Anuna is confident that the company can deliver on a dependable model, which won\u2019t make consumers pay higher prices than other payments and shipping options.\n\nShe\u2019s relying on her experience at Amazon, Net-a-Porter and Shopify, plus four years in China running a logistics business.\n\nJessica Anuna, founder and CEO of Klasha. Image credit: Klasha\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t built Klasha alone. A glass wall separates the room where we meet from an adjacent room where her developers are having a chat, their laptops displaying several lines of code in pink and other colours.\n\nThe sales team, led by Fumi Aoki, is in another room crouched over computers. Aoki joined recently from Senri, a sales automation startup. Other members of the 11-person Klasha team have Nigerian startup experience from places like OPay, Andela and Boomplay.\n\nShooting for 5,000 Klasha merchants\n\nI wonder if Klasha can go on to integrate emerging fintech offerings \u2013 like Buy Now Pay Later. Anuna says her team has discussed it, but it is not on their short-term roadmap.\n\nAt the same time, she tries to sell me on the Klasha mobile app. The app enables users to generate virtual cards & shop on online stores regardless of whether the store has Klasha Checkout or not.\n\nKlasha\u2019s virtual card carries VISA\u2019s emblem and allows users to spend beyond the $100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The other distinct feature of the mobile app is sending money to peers using Twitter-like handles, which reminds me of Abeg, the peer-to-peer payments startup owned by Piggyvest.\n\nKlasha is in the virtual cards business. Goodbye $100 limits?\n\nAfter an hour-long conversation, I leave Anuna and her team to continue launch preparations. At least one influencer was drafted for publicity on D-Day; to drive app downloads.\n\nBut that will not be the metric to assess Klasha in three, six, or nine months. Instead, look out for how many major online stores and marketplaces Anuna has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have 5,000 merchants by Q1 2022,\u201d she says.\n\nHow many do they have right now? \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but we are on track.\u201d",

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users.

Users are also able to create multiple cards instantly and can easily dedicate each card to one web platform.\n\nFundall \u2013 run by a company of the same name founded in 2019 \u2013 is on a mission to provide all things money in one place to their customers.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Homzmart, an Egyptian-based marketplace startup, has secured $15 million in its Series A investment round, TechCrunch reports.\n\nIn February 2020, the startup\u2019s $1.3 million seed round was reported by Menabytes as one of the largest by an Egyptian startup. It, once again, surpasses previous records as it has now successfully closed the largest financing round in its sector in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nThe company was founded in 2019 by Mahmoud Ibrahim, former COO of Daraz \u2014 an online marketplace and logistics company that operates in South Asia and Southeast Asia \u2014 and Ibrahim Mohamed, former Head of Logistics at Jumia. Still, it didn\u2019t launch until the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis round of financing is co-led by China\u2019s MSA Capital \u2014 one of the investors in Homzmart\u2019s seed round in February 2020, alongside Nuwa Capital. Other participants include Rise Capital, Impact 46, EQ2 Ventures, and Outliers Venture Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomzmart claims the Egyptian furniture market is historically characterised by poor customer accessibility and high distribution costs for retailers.\n\nThe startup\u2019s business model, which involves collecting designs, price ranges, and other details of its retailers\u2019 products, handles high distribution costs for them by providing access to consumers \u2014 homeowners and professionals \u2014 who have flexible financing options.\n\nIt creates a one-stop-shop, hassle-free experience for consumers who are easily connected to retailers such as IKEA and Home Centre.\n\nHomzmart\u2019s platform incorporates artificial intelligence to optimise furniture sellers\u2019 content, with intelligent tools helping customers with purchasing decisions.\n\nAs Ibrahim said during the company\u2019s seed round, \u201cThere are 25 million people in the Middle East and North Africa region searching for home furnishing every month with no serious player serving them online.\u201d\n\nLaunched at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ibrahim expressed uncertainty about the company\u2019s survival due to anticipated behavioural changes in consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the reverse was the case as consumers seemed to like the product, resulting in more sales, as witnessed in most eCommerce and marketplaces during the height of the pandemic.\n\nMSA Capital\u2019s General Partner, Ben Harburg, cites this as one of the reasons the company joined in financing the startup again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the extreme vulnerabilities and inefficiencies of the Middle East\u2019s archaic offline retail ecosystem, logistics, and supply chain.\n\n\u201cInto the void stepped Homzmart as the next generation, digitally-enabled online marketplace and optimised logistics provider for large-item retail addressing both consumer and enterprise customers.\u201d\n\nHomzmart\u2019s founders\u2019 vast experience was another reason behind the firm\u2019s decision.\n\nHaving spent its first year in business understanding supply and demand, it now looks to scale its business model, expanding its reach across the region.\n\n\u201cWhatever we did in Egypt, we need to do across the region. Homzmart isn\u2019t looking to be just an Egyptian platform, rather a regional platform,\u201d said Ibrahim.\n\nIn keeping with this, Homzmart has strategically established operations close to Damietta City. Known as the region\u2019s largest manufacturing hub, Damietta would allow the company to streamline MENA\u2019s vertical industry supply chain.\n\nHomzmart currently showcases over 55,000 products from thousands of brands and merchants and claims to have 30x growth in sales. The online marketplace is tapping into the rapidly expanding $8 billion industry where 14 million customers in the region search online for furniture monthly.\n\nAs TechCrunch reports, Ibrahim says the company hopes to make sure it is building the right institutional infrastructure for its business and to ensure that after two or three years, it is building a very solid, multi-billion dollar business.\n\nPhotocredit: TechCrunch\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nCome learn strategies on how to get funding, grow your network and position your startup business for profit.

          "text": "East-Africa-based telecommunications company, Safaricom, ended its business year on March 31, 2021. The telecom giant marked 20 years of servicing the African market and released its financial report on Thursday, May 13, 2021.\n\nAs with many other businesses, the first half of the fiscal year was difficult for the company because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDespite a subdued financial performance, the company had some solid wins.\n\nLike the previous financial year, revenue from voice and messaging declined, with Internet data experiencing a revenue boost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMessaging revenue went from KSh 15,193.8 million (~$141,619) to KSh 13,602.4 million (~$126,787), which was an 11.7% drop. The Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for their monthly active messaging customers reduced from KSh 60.77 to Ksh52.7.\n\nFor voice services, revenue fell by 4.6%, with a decline from KSh 86,349.4 million ($804,826) to KSh 82,55.0 million ($769,473). The ARPU for active monthly voice customers went from KSh 287.16 to KSh 257.72.\n\nInternet revenue took an impressive leap from KSh 39,641.9 million ($369,513) to KSh 44,793.2 million ($417,554). With a year-on-year increase of 11.5%. This has been the trend as other telecom giants in Africa recorded revenue boosts in Internet data in recent financial reports.\n\nM-Pesa gets shaky\n\nIn this fiscal year, the company\u2019s mobile money platform, M-Pesa, experienced a slight dive.\n\nIn what happens to be the first of its kind, revenue dropped by 2.1% in the first half of the financial year, falling from KSh 84,382 billion ($786, 545,581) to KSh 82,647 billion ($770,410,517).\n\nThis could be because of fees waived on person-to-person (P2P), Bank to M-Pesa wallet (B2C), and M-Pesa to bank wallet (C2B) transactions of KSh 1,000 ($9.32) and below.\n\nThe waiver was to curtail the rapid spread of COVID-19. When the waiver ended in January 2021, P2P transaction charges were reduced by 45% for low-value transaction bands below KSh 7,500 ($69.91), while B2C and C2B transactions remained free.\n\nHowever, M-Pesa recovered significantly. Total M-Pesa transaction value grew by 58.2% YoY to KSh 22.4 trillion ($208.8 billion).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe volume of transactions grew by 29.8% to eleven point six billion. Currently, M-Pesa accounts for 33.0% of Safaricom\u2019s service revenue.\n\nPlans for the new year include setting up 5G trials across more Kenyan cities.

          "text": "Boko Haram militants: Six reasons they have not been defeated, by BBC\n\nThe phrase that Nigerian militant group Boko Haram had been \u201ctechnically defeated\u201d is ringing increasingly hollow.\n\nSeven months into his first term in 2015 President Muhammadu Buhari coined the term, but the group and its offshoots have never gone away.\n\nThe military has managed to retake territory and dislodged the fighters from some of their hideouts. But a recent spike in deadly violence, focused in the north-east, where the Islamist group began its insurgency in 2009, has led many to ask what is at the root of the authorities\u2019 failure.\n\nAlready this year there have been nearly 100 attacks, according to one estimate. A number of military bases as well as towns, including Geidam and Damasak, a hub for aid workers, have been overrun. Hundreds have been killed and weapons, food and medicines have all been looted.\n\nThere are six main reasons why Boko Haram has not been defeated despite the government claims, experts say.\n\n1: Root causes not addressed\n\nAn over-reliance on a military strategy to confront Boko Haram is at the heart of the state\u2019s inability to deal with the threat, argues security analyst Kabiru Adamu from Beacon Consulting.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, unfortunately, almost 11 or 12 years into the counter-insurgency operation, we are not seeing major successes,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\n\u201cYes, the military will dislodge the terrorists but then because they are still able to exercise influence, they\u2019re able to recruit, they\u2019re able to generate funding, they\u2019re able to acquire weaponry, then they regroup.\u201d\n\nExperts say that it is not that people in the north-east sympathise with Boko Haram and its splinter group, the Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province, but that neglect from the authorities and desperation often drive people into the hands of the militants.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that to address insurgency or terrorism, you need more than military operation. You need to address the root causes of the insurgency,\u201d Mr Adamu says.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we haven\u2019t seen enough efforts in that regard.\u201d\n\nHe points to a lack of good governance that leaves the population impoverished, frustrated and uneducated as \u201cone huge root cause\u201d.\n\nThere are major government initiatives that are meant to speed up development in the north-east, but little progress has been made.\n\nThere is also the National Counter-Terrorism Strategy which also involves economic development and counter-radicalisation, in addition to the deployment of troops. But Mr Adamu says it appears the strategy is not being fully implemented.\n\nOthers, like Security analyst at the Tony Blair Institute for Change, Bulama Bukarti, argue that along with deradicalisation there should be a huge surge in military activity similar to what was seen in Iraq and Syria when the Islamic State group\u2019s so-called caliphate was dismantled.\n\n2: Boko Haram\u2019s ability to recruit\n\nThe endemic poverty in parts of the region as well as the insurgents\u2019 violent methods enable the continued recruitment of generation after generation of fighters, experts say.\n\n\u201cPeople are readily available for recruitment just to survive,\u201d security expert Abdullahi Yalwa said, citing the problems of joblessness and poor governance.\n\nMr Bukarti highlights the \u201csystematic campaign of forced recruitment of young people\u201d.\n\nBorno state Governor, Babagana Zullum, recently told the BBC that the insurgents were even recruiting people who had previously been forced from their homes by the conflict itself.\n\n3: Lack of equipment\n\nEven when it comes to the fighting there is the problem of weaponry, according to Mr Adamu, who says that the military is ill-equipped.\n\nResearch by his firm, Beacon Consulting, found that there were about 6.5 million small arms and light weapons in circulation in Nigeria but just 586,000 are in the hands of security forces.\n\nIt is not the case that all of the remainder are being used by the Islamist militants, but the figures highlight that there are a huge amount of weapons available that are not in the military\u2019s control.\n\nMr Adamu also says that \u201cwhat we are seeing based on evidence is that these [armed] groups have a higher calibre of weapons, unfortunately, than the military\u201d.\n\n4: Corruption\n\nCorruption may be one thing that is holding the military back when it comes to improving its equipment. It is suspected that a lot of money meant to bolster the campaign against Boko Haram has ended up in officials\u2019 pockets.\n\nMr Yalwa says that in some cases the fight against Boko Haram is not being fought with \u201csincerity\u201d and \u201cit seems some people have turned it into merchandise and are into self-enrichment\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, the military was hamstrung by a US arms embargo over human rights abuses. President Buhari and his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, both complained that this was hampering counter-insurgency efforts.\n\nBut this was lifted by President Donald Trump in 2018 and as a result Nigeria is expecting the delivery of Super Tucano aircraft. This should build on the military\u2019s air superiority, which Mr Adamu believes is not being used to its full advantage.\n\nAlthough there are claims that even this superiority is not paying off.\n\n5: Military strategy not working\n\nMr Bukarti told the BBC the insurgents appear to have \u201cunderstood and adapted to the pattern of military airstrikes\u201d and are taking advantage of the difficult terrain in Nigeria\u2019s north-east to evade military attacks.\n\nBoko Haram at a glance\n\nFounded in 2002\n\nInitially focused on opposing Western education\n\nLaunched military operations in 2009\n\nGained attention in 2014 with Chibok kidnappings\n\nPledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2015\n\nSplit into two factions in 2016\n\nline\n\nThere are also other aspects of the strategy that have been criticised.\n\nOver the past year the army has been withdrawing troops from smaller bases and concentrating them in large formations known as Super Camps.\n\nThis strategy was adopted in early 2020 when soldiers were under regular attack and their weapons were being stolen.\n\nHowever, it has left vast swathes of rural communities unprotected, analysts say.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence suggesting an increase in attacks on communities between the period when the Super Camps were created and now. So clearly the Super Camps left the rural communities more vulnerable,\u201d argues Mr Adamu.\n\nThis has also devastated the livelihoods of people in north-east Nigeria who rely on fishing and crop farming, and had an impact on food production.\n\nThe military is also hampered by gaps in intelligence gathering as well as being unable to plug information leaks.\n\nThis means that sometimes it appears that \u201cthe insurgents are ahead of the military\u201d, Mr Yalwa says.\n\nThe army disputes this alleged problem. Its spokesperson Mohammed Yarima recently said that \u201ctroops are in high fighting spirit and determined to as ever to clear the [north-east] region and the country of vestiges of Boko Haram terrorists\u201d.\n\n6: Boko Haram\u2019s influence is spreading\n\nAdding to the problems of dealing with Boko Haram is that the insurgency, once confined to the north-east, appears to be spreading.\n\nThere are concerns that armed criminal gangs in other parts of the north and centre of the country are forging links with the militants.\n\nLast year, Boko Haram released a video claiming a presence in Niger state which is far from its usual area of operations. The authorities there issued a statement in March saying Boko Haram fighters had infiltrated the state occupying forests and attacking communities.\n\nLast December, then army chief Lt Gen Yusuf Tukur Buratai suggested that the fight against Boko Haram could continue for another 20 years if the civilian and military approaches were not better co-ordinated.\n\nThe hard-pressed residents of north-eastern Nigeria will hope that warning does not come to pass.",

          "text": "The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Muhammad, on Tuesday, called on the members of the Judiciary Staff Union (JUSUN) to end their ongoing nationwide strike.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by Mr Muhammad\u2019s spokesperson, Ahuraka Isah.\n\nThe strike , which the judiciary workers embarked upon on April 6 to agitate for the financial autonomy of the judiciary particularly at the state level, clocked seven weeks on Tuesday.\n\nCourts at both the state and federal levels across the country have now been shut for 43 days as a result of the strike.\n\nBut the CJN, in the statement by his spokesperson said, his call on JUSUN to end the strike followed a fresh briefing he received from the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, who leads the Federal Government\u2019s negotiation team that engages with the leadership of the union.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige on Tuesday met with the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad at the Supreme Court over the ongoing strike embarked upon by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) to demand for financial autonomy for the Judiciary in the country.\n\n\u201cUpon being briefed by the Minister on the negotiation level so far, the CJN then requested the JUSUN to call off the strike in the interest of the nation and the larger interest of justice,\u201d the statement read, in part.\n\nThe statement added that the CJN is of the view\n\nthat calling off the strike \u201cwould also allow opportunity for further negations towards the resolution of the dispute.\u201d\n\n\u2018Strike is sub judice\u2019\n\nBut the CJN, who earlier acknowledged the justification for the ongoing strike, said publicly for the first time on Tuesday, that the ongoing strike is \u201csub judice\u201d, a suggestion that the industrial action may be preemptive of a pending suit in court.\n\n\u201cBesides, the CJN observed that some of the issues in contention are already sub judice, as such there is need to give requisite legal process enough opportunity to be exhausted,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThe CJN did not give details of the pending legal matter pending in court that the ongoing strike may possibly be infringing on.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES is not aware of any suit challenging the constitutional provision granting financial autonomy to the judiciary which is the core of the judiciary workers\u2019 strike.\n\nBut there is a suit filed by the 36 state governors under the auspices of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) challenging the Executive Order 10 issued by President Muhammadu Buhari in May 2020 for the enforcement of the financial independence of the judiciary.\n\nStrike, failed meetings\n\nMr Muhammad has met with the leadership of JUSUN on two occasions since when the strike started 43 days ago.\n\nAt the end the meetings, the union had insisted on going on with the strike until its demand for strict compliance with constitutional provision that prescribes direct funding of state judiciaries and legislatures directly from the federation account.\n\nDespite meeting with the union leaders on different occasions, the labour minister too has not been able to convince them to call of the strike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe call by the CJN comes about 10 days after JUSUN rejected the 36 state governors\u2019 proposed template for the implementation of judiciary\u2019s financial autonomy being demanded by the workers.\n\nThe governors, in their proposal, seek the creation of a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to oversee the distribution of funds to the three arms of government at the state level.\n\nBut in a communique the union issued after a May 8 meeting of its National Working Committee (NWC), the union insisted on its demand that funds meant for the state judiciaries must be deducted directly from the federation account and paid to the heads of courts through the National Judicial Council (NJC).\n\nIt maintained that the provisions of the constitution \u201ccannot be negotiated, doctored, manipulated and therefore must be obeyed\u201d.\n\nAs a condition to end its ongoing strike, the union insisted that all the state judiciaries\u2019 funds for October 2020 till May 2021 must be deducted directly from source, the federation account, and paid to the heads of courts through the NJC as prescribed by the constitution.\n\nThe federal government currently complies with the constitutional provision which JUSUN demands compliance with.\n\nBut at the state level, governors take funds meant for the three arms of government from the federation account, but only funds the judiciary and the legislature as they please, without minding how much they are entitled to in the budgets.",

          "text": "* Insists peace yet to return in Effium community\n\nThe Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has condemned the alleged kidnap of a former coordinator of Anuagata Development Centre, Okposi in Ohaozara local government area of Ebonyi State, Barr. Amos Ogbonnaya, by political thugs.\n\nThe victim was said to have been abducted at a gunpoint after he was bombarded with series of threatening text messages and phone calls by some politicians in the state shortly \u201cafter he made some revealing expose on the systemic corruption that has become the modus of the third tier administration by the state government.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released to journalists on Tuesday in Abuja by the AESID President, Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, he urged the the Inspector General of Police to immediately constitute a special crack team to investigate and bring the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cThe occasion, we recall was a discussion programme on the African Independent Television, AIT penultimate week wherein Ogbonnaya had carefully reeled out how the Governor and his surrogates using the State\u2019s Joint Account Committee, JAC, siphon hundreds of millions of Federal Government\u2019s monthly Local Government allocations while handing the administrators peanuts to run their offices.\n\n\u201cIn outrightly condemning this ugly incident which we now consider as one attack on Ebonyians too many buoyed by the simple fact of the intolerant disposition of the government to criticisms and opposing views, we ask both the Governor and the CP who has shown obvious negligence in arresting the suspects should step aside.\n\n\u201cAESID urges the Inspector General of Police to immediately constitute a special crack team to investigate and bring these evil perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cWe feel justified in this request because a lot of attacks on innocent Ebonyians since Umahi ascended to power have been swept under the carpet, therefore emboldening the political thugs that are often recruited as willing tools to unleash mayhem on peaceful individuals just for baring their minds on issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAll that have been fingered in this terrible incident must therefore be brought to book without further delay no matter how highly placed they may be.\u201d\n\nWhile cautioning the state government against further attack on opposition leaders, the group described the development as open invitation to anarchy if such is not addressed in Ebonyi state.\n\nReacting to the recent crisis in Effium community in Ohaukwu local government area of the state, the accountability group said the claims by the state government that peace had return to the war-ravaged area were untrue.\n\n\u201cWe urge Nigerians and the world to disregard and discountenance the claims of the Governor because killings are still going on in the area even as we speak. For we strongly believe that the blood of those innocent and defenceless citizens will yet cry for justice on the head of all those who have a hand in the Effium carnage.\n\n\u201cConclusively, we pray for total return of peace in every troubled part of the state as we charge Governor Umahi to focus on fighting the anthropogenic hunger and poverty that his administration has made an official policy in the state rather than unleashing his army of thugs against Ebonyians who insist on doing things right!,\u201d the group said.",

          "title": "Cement prices hit N4500 in Nigeria\u2019s SouthEast",
          "text": "A market survey in the region shows that block makers are shutting down\n\nBy Our Reporters\n\nCement prices have increased by 67-100 per cent in the South East states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, hitting as high as N4,500 in Abakaliki.\n\nA market survey conducted by NAN at various wholesale and retail shops in the zone shows that the price of the product has increased almost by 100 % when compared to the price in 2020.\n\nA cement dealer at Kenyatta Market in Enugu State capital, Mr Ifeanyi Amadi said the increase in the product\u2019s price started last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increase in dollar exchange.\n\nHe noted that a trailer load of Dangote cement with 600 bags initially sold at N1.5 million in 2020 but is now N2.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother retailer at Uwani, Samuel Uwakwe, said he was surprised at the rate prices of the product in the country.\n\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\n\nUwakwe lamented that few individuals were given opportunity to supply the product and pleaded with suppliers to reduce the prices and make it available for the citizens.\n\nHe maintained that the prices would likely crash during raining season.\n\nA block maker, Mr Albert Okechukwu noted that increase in the price of the product affected his business as he still sold six-inch and nine-inch block at N170 and N180 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is the same price we sold last year and it is same till date because we cannot change prices in order to retain our customers but most block industries have reduced quality of their blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nA site Engineer, Mr Emma Ugwuoke said he wanted to start a building in the village when the price was N2,800 last year but was waiting to see if it would come down.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back next time, I was told it was N3, 000 and to my greatest surprise, they sell N3,900 and N4,000 now in my village.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing one can do than to buy it like that. I want government to do something urgently about it because it is frustrating buying cement at that price,\u201d Ugwuoke said.\n\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\n\nThose who spoke to NAN said the price hike had further dashed the hope of many Nigerians, wishing to own their personal homes.\n\nA businessman, Mr Victor Ugwu, said he had to suspend his building project because of the \u201cunfortunate development\u201d.\n\nUgwu said: \u201cI have stopped my project for now. I cannot afford to continue with the current price of the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe economy is very bad so I hope to wait until there is a drop in the price.\n\n\u201cI think the hike can be attributed to the monopoly being enjoyed by the cement producers in the country. Unfortunately, there may not be any respite until that monopoly is broken.\u201d\n\nHowever, a cement dealer, Mr James Ogbonna, said the problem had nothing to do with the manufacturers of the commodity.\n\nRather, Ogbonna blamed the price hike on the activities of \u201cshylock distributors\u201d of cement.\n\nHe said that the hike had affected his business adversely, adding that cement patronage had been at the lowest ebb, since the price hike.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first and second week of March, we sold a bag for N3,200, but within the third week we started selling at N3,500.\n\n\u201cBy the end of March, the price moved up to N4,000 and now, we sell between N4,000 and N4100, depending on the brand.\u201d\n\nAnother dealer, Mr Godwin Okafor, said that his sales had dropped drastically as a result of the hike.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of challenges in this cement business now. When we make deposit and order for the goods, it takes about one month before we get delivery,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in Awka in Anambra as stakeholders decry the situation.\n\nMr Kenechukwu Okoye, a cement dealer along Zik Avenue, Awka said before the #EndSARS protest in 2020, a 50kg bag of cement was sold at N2,500.\n\n\u201cShortly after the #EndSARS, the price rose to N3,000 and from there to the present price of N4,000 and N4,100, we are selling today,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye said though the distributors initially blamed the problem on difficulties encountered by the hauling firm transporting the product, the situation had come to stay.\n\nIn Owerri, Imo capital, price of cement is between N3,850 and N4300, depending on the brand.\n\nAt the Building Materials Market in Naze, Owerri North Local Government Area, Dangote and BUA cement are sold at N4,000 per bag while BUA and UNICEM are sold for N3,900.\n\nMr Okechukwu Okonya, a seller, said the cost could be attributed to high cost of transportation as a result of fuel price.\n\nOkonya also said major dealers sometimes hoard the product in their warehouses to create artificial scarcity.\n\nAnother trader, Mr Marcel Iwu, agreed that although there had been hoarding by major dealers, manufacturers had also complained of increased cost of raw materials.\n\nIwu added that the prices could go higher or reduce at any given time, noting that even if prices fall, traders would want to sell off their old stock at higher rates.\n\nIn Abakaliki, Ebonyi, prices of almost all building materials have gone up.\n\nThe prices of cement, rods of various sizes, corrugated roofing sheets and other building materials and accessories according to NAN findings have been on the increase since January.\n\nThe price of Dangote and Bua which sold at N2,500 earlier in November and December 2020 now sold between N4000 and N4500.\n\nSimilarly, Unicem cement which also sold at N2,300 within the same period had also gone up to N4,000 and N4,300.\n\nMr John Okoh, a cement dealer at Kpiri-Kpiri market in an interview with NAN attributed the development to lack of price control mechanism and high rate of exchange rate of the Naira against the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe development is indeed affecting sales and business because many builders have put a stop to their building and other construction projects because they cannot cope with the present high cost of the product.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Clement Igbo, who owns a block moulding factory, said that the high cost of cement was hampering production, saying that he no longer produced maximally due to lack of buyers.\n\n\u201cA bag of Dangote cement which is one of the best products for our business is selling for N4500 and it is difficult to buy at this prevailing price and make enough production.\n\n\u201cWe sell six inch and nine-inch block before this price increase at N150 and N200 but now 6 inch-block is sold at N220 while the 9-inch sells for between N250 and N300 respectively.\n\n\u201cMany block industries in the town have closed down production while some have compromised standard which pose great dangers to the building industry,\u201d Igbo said.\n\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\nMr Jerry Onwe, an economic activist urged the Federal and state governments to revive moribund cement factories across the states to meet the increasing demands of cement consumption in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the quest for mass housing for poor Nigerians would remain elusive if urgent steps were not taken to address the high cost of building materials in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where an average worker earns N30,000 monthly as take-home wage, how can such a person afford a house of his own in view of the prevailing price of building materials?\n\n\u201cWe have reached a cross road as far as the issue of building materials is concerned and this is a time for government to intervene and bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",
          "summary": "\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",

          "title": "Breaking: El-Rufai sacks nurses, lecturers, orders fresh recruitment",
          "text": "As Nigeria Labour Congress strike in Kaduna state enters day two, Governor Nasir el-Rufai has ordered the sack of nurses below Grade Level 14 and Kaduna State University (KASU) lecturers who joined the strike.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai also declared the labour leaders as bandits whose actions are equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing its citizens.\n\nSpeaking in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Mr Muyiwa Adekeye, el-Rufai lamented that some nurses engaged in sabotage of some of its health facilities to join the strike, adding that many nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\nThe governor singled out three nurses of Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, who he said the state will be prosecuting for allegedly disconnecting the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai said the Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed, noting that any academic staff of Kaduna State University (KASU) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not tolerate criminal acts disguised as industrial action. Today, the Kaduna state government reviewed the sundry criminal actions that have defined the campaign of economic and social sabotage and lawlessness waged by the NLC.\n\n\u201cKDSG considers as unacceptable the serial violations of the Miscellaneous Offences Act and the Trade Union Act that have occurred over the last two days. The state government commends citizens for remaining calm amidst this assault on their rights and comfort and their businesses.\n\n\u201cHowever, KDSG cannot be expected to tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients, unlawful trespass into public facilities and the wanton use of coercion and restraints of personal freedom by the NLC.\n\n\u201cAlso, KDSG cannot ignore the illegal pressures brought to disrupt the operations of banks and other private business whose staff and customers do not have any industrial dispute with the state or any other government. KDSG regrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities. Nurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\n\n\u201cReports from Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disclosed that some identified nurses disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day old baby in an incubator on Monday, 17th May 2021. The names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby.\n\n\u201cIn addition, KDSG has decided the following: Ayuba Wabba and his senior confederates in the NLC are declared wanted, and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna state, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts. They are advised to report to the Ministry of Justice and the Police Headquarters to take their statements;\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike. Salaries that could have gone to them are to be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty. The Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed;\n\n\u201cAny academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed. The authorities of KASU are to submit a copy of the attendance register for all categories of staff daily to the Secretary to the State Government and the Commissioner of Education. All MDAs are also to submit daily copies of attendance register to the Head of Service;\n\n\u201cKDSG views the actions of the NLC as equivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens. Bandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends: trying to hold hostage the freedoms, economic interests, livelihoods and resources of the people of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cKDSG will not submit its treasury to the entitled minority. We will reform and rightsize our public service to meet the needs and resources of the Kaduna state even if the NLC strikes ad infinitum. The government remains committed to providing social services beyond paying salaries, always putting the interests of the many ahead of the few,\u201d el-Rufai said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Public affairs analyst, Barr. Akugbe J. Osayande has described as executive lawlessness and rascality the refusal of State governors to implement executive order 10 on financial autonomy to State judiciary as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Friday, May 22, 2020, signed the executive order 10 which granted financial autonomy to state assemblies and judiciary but State governors in a swift reaction held a meeting with President Buhari and attorney general of the Federation Abubakar Malami over the interpretation of the order.\n\nThe executive order mandated the state governors to always include the allocations of the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets but the governors, who met under the aegis of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), rejected the president\u2019s order and described it as an unnecessary distraction.\n\nThis development had forced members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) to embark on a nationwide indefinite strike forcing the closure of Federal High Courts in different states across the nation.\n\nBut legal expert, Barr. Osayande maintained that the governors by reason of their refusal to honor the dictate of the constitution on judicial independence have violated the oath of their office which they swore to uphold the constitution.\n\nSpeaking on the principle of separation of powers, Barr. Osayande insisted that since the constitution had contemplated that the three arms of government should be separate and independent, financial autonomy remains a very important component of independence and should be respected by the State executives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the judiciary can be independent if they are still tied to the apron string of the governors to get the money that belongs to them. I can\u2019t be independent of you when every time I need money you are the one giving me. So the law has given everybody that fraction of independence.\n\n\u201cWhat the governors are doing is contempt of court. The same court that made many of them who lost elections governors has given them an order to follow what the constitution says, yet they refused,\u201d he said.",

Osayande has described as executive lawlessness and rascality the refusal of State governors to implement executive order 10 on financial autonomy to State judiciary as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Friday, May 22, 2020, signed the executive order 10 which granted financial autonomy to state assemblies and judiciary but State governors in a swift reaction held a meeting with President Buhari and attorney general of the Federation Abubakar Malami over the interpretation of the order.\n\nThe executive order mandated the state governors to always include the allocations of the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets but the governors, who met under the aegis of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), rejected the president\u2019s order and described it as an unnecessary distraction.\n\nThis development had forced members of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) to embark on a nationwide indefinite strike forcing the closure of Federal High Courts in different states across the nation.\n\nBut legal expert, Barr. Osayande maintained that the governors by reason of their refusal to honor the dictate of the constitution on judicial independence have violated the oath of their office which they swore to uphold the constitution.\n\nSpeaking on the principle of separation of powers, Barr. Osayande insisted that since the constitution had contemplated that the three arms of government should be separate and independent, financial autonomy remains a very important component of independence and should be respected by the State executives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the judiciary can be independent if they are still tied to the apron string of the governors to get the money that belongs to them. I can\u2019t be independent of you when every time I need money you are the one giving me. So the law has given everybody that fraction of independence.\n\n\u201cWhat the governors are doing is contempt of court. The same court that made many of them who lost elections governors has given them an order to follow what the constitution says, yet they refused,\u201d he said.",

Deputies, their weapons drawn, surrounded the car and asked him to exit, but Brown attempted to drive away.\n\n\u201cThe decision to flee, which Brown made on his own, quickly escalated the situation from a show of force to an employment of force,\u201d Womble said, adding that Brown had steered his vehicle towards one of the officers.\n\n\u201cThe facts of this case clearly illustrate the officers who used deadly force on Andrew Brown, Jr did so reasonably, and only when a violent felon used a deadly weapon to place their lives in danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo officer will be criminally charged,\u201d Womble said.\n\nIn the space of 44 seconds, officers fired 14 shots, at the vehicle and then at the rear of the vehicle after Brown turned it around.

          "text": "France coach Didier Deschamps will call up Karim Benzema to his 26-man squad for Euro 2020 despite the striker facing trial for alleged blackmail, ESPN is reporting.\n\nThe American media organisation quoted sources as saying Benzema never lost hope of playing again for France and that he had always felt he could bring something to the team.\n\nThe report added that Benzema held out hope of a reconciliation with Deschamps and that the plan is for the striker to return as a starter in the country\u2019s first choice XI.\n\nDeschamps decision comes more than five years since Benzema\u2019s last cap.\n\nAfter being a key player for the national team coach from 2012 when Deschamps took over from Laurent Blanc, the two men fell out over Benzema\u2019s alleged involvement in the Mathieu Valbuena sex tape scandal.\n\nIn an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca, Benzema accused Deschamps of having \u201cbowed to the pressure of a racist part of France\u201d when agreeing to leave him out of the squad.\n\nThe Real Madrid striker is suspected of pressuring Valbuena in 2015 to pay blackmailers who threatened to reveal an intimate video in which Valbuena featured. Benzema will stand trial from Oct. 20-22 on the charge of complicity in attempted blackmail. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile Deschamps has not picked Benzema since October 2015 and said he would \u201cnever forget\u201d Benzema\u2019s comments, he has never stated that he would not call him up again. Benzema was named best French player in a foreign league by the French professional footballers\u2019 union on Sunday.\n\nFour other people will also stand trial over the attempted blackmail scheme. When the story broke, Benzema faced a deluge of criticism, and then-Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he had \u201cno place\u201d in the national team.\n\nBenzema, who will hope to win La Liga with Real Madrid on the final day of the season this week, has starred for Zinedine Zidane\u2019s men this season, with 22 goals and eight assists in 33 league matches.\n\nBenzema will form a front three with Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Kylian Mbappe and Barcelona\u2019s Antoine Griezmann, who are both big fans of the returning striker.\n\nGriezmann has played with Benzema for France before, including in his last cap, away in Armenia in October 2015, when they both scored.\n\nEuro 2020, suspended from last summer because of the coronavirus pandemic, kicks off on June 11. France are in Group F along with Hungary, Portugal and Germany. Benzema has appeared 81 times for France and scored 27 goals.",

When the storm struck, the barge\u2019s anchors gave way and it began drifting.\n\nThe Indian navy has mounted a massive air and sea rescue mission for the missing oil workers, which is being hampered by huge waves: \u201cThere are waves of 20 to 25 feet (six to 7.6m), the winds are high and the visibility is low,\u201d said navy spokesman Vivek Madhwal.\n\n\u201cShips and aircraft have been deployed for the search and rescue mission.\u201d\n\nA navy spokesman said it had dispatched three warships to save those aboard the three stranded commercial barges.

The navy said the barge had since run aground in a rocky patch of the sea. Everyone on board is reported to be safe.\n\nThe third barge, about 92km from the Gujarat coast, is attached to an oil rig. There are reportedly 196 people aboard and another 100 reportedly stuck on the rig.\n\nInitially classified as \u201cextremely severe\u201d, the cyclone made landfall in Gujarat state late on Monday with wind speeds of up to 160km/h (100mph).\n\nIt narrowly missed Mumbai, but the barges adrift off the city\u2019s coast were unable to return to the harbour on time.\n\nWinds have ravaged coastal areas in the western state of Gujarat, uprooting trees and electricity poles. In Saurashtra district, electricity supply has been cut as a precautionary measure.\n\nAbout 200,000 people were evacuated across several states as the cyclone approached, bringing with it heavy rains and gusty winds.\n\nThe storm has hit the region amid a devastating second wave of Covid-19 that has overwhelmed Indian hospitals.",

Governor El-Rufai has authorised the state\u2019s Ministry of Health to relieve all nurses below Grade Level 14 for embarking on an unlawful strike.\n\nThe governor also claims to have reports that suggest three nurses from the Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital disconnected the oxygen supply of a two-day-old baby in an incubator on Monday. According to Mr El-Rufai, \u201cthe names of the three nurses from the Special Baby Care Unit (SBCU) who were involved in this despicable act have been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice to initiate prosecution for attempted murder or murder in the event we lose the baby\u201d.\n\nMr El-Rufai has also warned that academic staff of the state-owned university (Kaduna State University) that does not report for work will be dismissed.\n\nHe again declared Ayuba Wabba, the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress and other labour leaders wanted, assuring that they will be \u201cvigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts\u201d.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cthe Ministry of Health will dismiss all nurses below GL 14 for going on an unlawful strike.

Active cases in the country also decreased by more than 165,000 on Tuesday \u2014 the biggest dip in weeks.\n\nBut deaths have continued to rise and hospitals are still swamped by patients.\n\nIndia has recorded nearly 280,000 virus deaths since the pandemic began. Experts warn that both the number of deaths and total reported cases are likely vast undercounts.\n\nInfections in India have surged since February in a disastrous turn blamed on more contagious variants as well as government decisions to allow massive crowds to gather for religious festivals and political rallies.\n\nIn the last month, cases have more than tripled and reported deaths have gone up six times \u2014 but testing has only increased by 1.6 times, according to Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan tracking India\u2019s battle with the virus. With infections outrunning testing capabilities, there are fears that many cases are going undetected.\n\nExperts also say India has lagged behind in doing the testing needed to track and better understand a worrisome virus variant first detected in the country. On Monday, the Health Ministry said 17 new labs will be brought online to help track variants.\n\nThe variant first identified in India has prompted global concern \u2014 most notably in Britain, where it has more than doubled in a week, defying a sharp nationwide downward trend in infections.\n\nMeanwhile, ever since India opened up vaccinations to all adults this month, the pace of administering shots has plunged. Many states have said they don\u2019t have enough stock to give out. The southern state of Karnataka, for example, has temporarily halted its drive to inoculate those aged between 18 and 44 at government-run centers due to a shortage of doses.",
