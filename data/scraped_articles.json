Empowerment is about developing yourself and accepting responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe 2020/2021 STEP enterprises include Welding and Fabrication with eight months training duration; Fashion Design and Tailoring (seven months); Tiling and Interlocking (six months); Electrical Installation and Solar Works (eight months); Catering and Confectionery (four months); Hairdressing and Braiding (four months)Audio-Visual services (four months); PoP, Painting and Screed-Making (for months).\u201d\n\nListing quality, discipline and integrity as the hallmark of the high success rate recorded in the programme, he said that everyone desired to be part of the programme because of the quality of the job creation brand.\n\nHe said the essence of the workshop was to give the trainees the right mindset to impact in them the skills, the virtue and the attributes that would make them succeed in the training programme under the STEP initiative of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nEboh said: \u201cThe quality of the training and the support package is superb. It is an organized programme. The training manual is available both to the trainers and the trainees, that is the quality that the job creation programme represents.

If you do not have time for this programme, you will be shown the way out.\n\n\u201cPersonal effectiveness is the most important elements for success in the training programme and what we impact in the trainees is that they cannot succeed as an entrepreneur if they are not personally effective.\u201d\n\nIn his lecture titled: \u201cThe Role and Activities of Directorate of Youth Monitoring and Mentoring in Relation to STEP Trainees,\u201d the Executive Assistant to the Governor on Youth Monitoring and Mentoring (DYMM), Mr Edward Mekwunye, said the mandate of DYMM was to sustain the success recorded in the programme over the years.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Senior Special Assistants to the Governor on Job and Wealth Creation in the bureau, Mr Tony Omonemu, Mr Leonard Esegbue, Mr Emmanuel Osazuwa and Mr Frank Ebikefe told the beneficiaries to make the training count in their lives have been among the few 600 enrollees who made it into the programme out of the over 23,000 that applied for the programme.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Bauchi State Government, on Saturday, identified two local government areas of the state, Bauchi and Toro, as the epicentres of Avian Influenza, also known as bird flu.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Sama\u2019ila Adamu Burga, informed that the state was among seven states in the country that had a resurgence of the highly infectious zoonotic disease since January this year.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, Bauchi and Toro LGAs were badly affected by the bird flu disease, informing that about 50,000 birds at five and four farms in Toro and Bauchi respectively, were battling with the disease.\n\nHe added only last Thursday alone 27,000 birds culled in Narabi village in Toro Local Government Area and called on poultry farmers and the general public to adhere strictly to the guidelines on marketing and movement of poultry products, general hygiene and consumption of wholesome poultry and poultry products.\n\nBurga emphasised on the need for the people of the state, particularly poultry farmers to be proactive in maintaining high standards of bio security on their farms, as well as maintaining due diligence in sourcing of poultry and poultry products from reliable and certified sources.\n\nDescribing Avian influenza as a highly infectious disease, the commissioner warned that it could be transmitted from animals to humans, adding that the disease is well known to have caused human death as well as economic losses either directly through loss of birds and their products or indirectly through losses in the poultry value chain.\n\nTracing incidence of bird flu in Nigeria, Burga informed that the disease was first recorded in 2006 at Sambawa Farms in Kaduna State, adding that it later spread to other states of the country and resurged in 2007, 2015, 2019 and this year.\n\nThe commissioner stated that the series of bird flu outbreaks had caused devastation, leading to loss of the sources of livelihood for many people in the poultry value chain.\n\nHe, however, expressed happiness that so far no human being had contracted the disease in the state, submitting that tests carried out by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in conjunction with his ministry and the state Ministry of Health had returned negative.\n\n\u201cIt is gladdening to state that, so far, many of our poultry industry stakeholders such as poultry owners, workers, my field officers and live bird marketers were screened through a joint exercise between my ministry, Ministry of Health and NCDC. Samples were collected, sent to the laboratory and all the results turned out to be negative,\u201d Burga informed.\n\nWhile urging people of the state to promptly draw government\u2019s attention to suspected bird flu cases, the commissioner disclosed that the state Ministry of Agriculture had over 130 qualified veterinary doctors spread across the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nAccording to him, the veterinary doctors were always ready to attend to complaints from poultry farmers, marketers and indeed the general public.\n\nHe then urged for concerted efforts by all to curtail the current outbreak of the disease in the state, declaring that, \u201call hands must be on deck to ensure that the present wave is brought to a stop and prevent human infection in Bauchi State which can be a serious catastrophe.\u201d\n\nHe said this became imperative in view of the recent disclosure by the NCDC that seven human cases of bird flu had been recorded in Kano and Plateau States.",

No time again will Ebonyi man or woman be killed. Never again. People have the effrontery to say herdsmen are coming to kill people. Let them try it again. That rubbish must stop.\n\n\u201cThis madness in this country must stop. I see videos of Boko Haram ravaging places in the north unchecked. Where is our air fighting powers? We must not be ashamed to borrow fighter jets from other African countries. No nation will allow this kind of thing to be happening,\u201d he stated.\n\nEarlier in a remark, the Chairman of CAN Ebonyi State chapter, Rev. Fr.

          "text": "The Benue State Government has accused the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai of misleading President Muhammadu Buhari on issues of security in Nigeria.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Governor El-Rufai had in a statement, accused his Benue counterpart, Governor Ortom of using the insecurity in Benue to attack the Federal Government in order to cover up his failure.\n\nReacting, in a statement issued on Saturday by Terver Akase, the Chief Press Secretary to the state governor, the state government said El-Rufai is unqualified to speak on security issues in the country owing to his inability to curb kidnapping and killings in his state.\n\nThe statement also accused the Governor of dividing the people of Kaduna State stressing that Ortom is not the cause of the high level of insecurity in Kaduna State.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\n\u201cA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\n\n\u201cNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on a daily basis?\n\n\u2018El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave the way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\n\u201cKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside from the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do the same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\n\u201cNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari. El-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\n\n\u201cNasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a Governor who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to the Kaduna people in 2015?\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna Governor should know that only two days ago, the people of Benue State met at a stakeholders meeting in Makurdi and unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Ortom in recognition of his performance. That meeting was attended across party lines with leaders of All Progressives Congress, APC also present.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai and his conspirators must note that Benue State will not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats they wage against Governor Ortom.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State Governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace\u201d.",

          "title": "#Electoral Reforms: Is INEC proffering solutions or part of the problem? (1)",
          "text": "By John Ekundayo\n\nIn the last edition of Followership Challenge, towards the conclusion, this columnist wondered whether the umpire and regulator of elections into public offices in Nigeria is helping in resolving electoral issues or seemingly part of the intractable problem. Presently, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) appears to be far behind in initiating, inculcating and institutionalizing far-reaching reforms into the electoral process that will not only enhance the process but also make electioneering fair, equitable, credible and transparent. Moreover, as it had been succinctly stated in one of the editions of this column, with proper and all-encompassing reforms, there is the possibility of getting more voters participating in the ballot that in the previous three elections of 2011, 2015 and 2019. In the last three elections, less than 40% of registered voters actually voted; of the accredited voters who turned up on the election day, some did not return after accreditation while myriads of eligible voters were unable to get voters cards because of the cumbersome process of acquiring one.\n\nINEC: Time is still on your side!\n\nNigerians still have about 22 months to the 2023 elections. In this digital age, if the political will is there, a lot could still be accomplished taking cognizance of possible electoral reforms. In Yoruba common parlance, it is said that a child that raises his hands calls for the mother\u2019s attention to carry him. It is the onerous duty of INEC to consult followers and leaders (voters) across all spectra and strata of the Nigeria\u2019s society on possible reforms and seek ways and means of carrying them out effectively and efficiently. As a researcher, this columnist consulted with some stakeholders of the Nigeria\u2019s project. The outcome is what is expressed here and the next edition of Followership Challenge.\n\nInitiating and inculcating e-voting\n\nIn this day and age of digital technology, INEC should initiate electronic voting adapting and/or adopting such systems from other climes. This should be combined with paper voting in rural areas or hinterland. If INEC is serious to commence e-voting in 2023 general election, then, there is the need to do a pilot electronic voting in a bye election into the House of Assembly, House of Representatives or Senatorial seat between now and 2022. In a typical research study, a researcher tests his instrument through pilot study as this will reveal what needs to be amended, corrected or avoided in the real research study encompassing the population. It is pertinent to mention that in our context there are many sceptics and nay-sayers who are of the opinion that politicians will or can corrupt the e-voting process. I differ on this!\n\n\u201cEverything rises or falls on leadership\u201d says John Maxwell. The leaders at the helm of affairs in INEC should act; it is up to them! Nigerians know and appreciate leaders who take creative steps and make sustainable impact. Prof Ishaq Oloyede took over the mantle and sit in the saddle in Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB). In a short time, he decided with his team, no more business as usual! This is what is called leadership!! For the first time, in Nigeria, JAMB initiated a Computer Based Test (CBT). There were challenges. He and his team confronted the challenges and conquered them. Today, JAMB has empowered many Nigerians economically as many are owners of CBT Centres. Simultaneously, JAMB rakes in billions in revenue to the coffers of the Federal Government of Nigeria. In the same vein, all financial institutions in Nigeria are operating e-banking presently. There were initially confronted with challenges which were subsequently surmounted. Whither INEC? It is doable if the political will is there!\n\nElectronic Transmission of Votes\n\nIt is not enough to inculcate e-voting in our elections, the results should subsequently be electronically transmitted from the polling units to the ward collation centres and from there to the local government area collation centres. Aftermath of the Returning Officer (RO) at the local government area (LGA) collation centre clearing the electronically transmitted results, the RO should electronically transmit the authenticated result with his personal identification number (pin) to the state headquarter collation centre. Thereafter, the state collation centre should transmit the authenticated result to the INEC national collation centre in Abuja. Meanwhile, the agents of parties, accredited journalists and election observers will be privy to this right from the unit to the ward, LGA, state and national levels to ensure credibility, accountability and transparency.\n\nAdvantages of e-voting\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are many benefits of e-voting. In a single stroke, like one analyst put it, most of the intractable and recurring issues that occur on election days will disappear into thin air in Nigeria. Elections will seemingly become fun. It is pertinent to state that some nagging and worrisome trends on election days, such as violence, allotment of votes, vote buying, corrupt inducement of electoral officials and security officers would be inexorably nailed. Moreover, the power of incumbency and federal might factors will fizzle out like a smoke. Ultimately, incidence of law suits after INEC declaration of winners will mellow out as only a fool argues with validated empirical results. In addition, a lot of money will be saved, overtime, as there is likely reduction of polling units dictating less personnel (electoral and security), less stationery used during and after elections and there will be enhanced logistics resulting in cut in recurrent expenditures. The beauty of it all, there is the likelihood of getting many voters casting their votes as fear of violence and not knowing whether their votes will count is eliminated. Ultimately, the election can be adjudged free and fair.\n\nIn conclusion, it is imperative for the top leaders of INEC to start tinkering now with the idea of electronic voting. It is doable! There is ample space to do a pilot study with a bye election between now and 2022. This will allow for further responses, reflections, reviews and reforms. Identified challenges will be confronted and conquered early enough before the general elections of 2023. It is doable! INEC, wake up, the world is moving forward, Nigeria should no more lag behind!! We are not laidback!!!",

          "text": "By Femi Orebe\n\nThe killings, banditry and terrorism that we are witnessing are not happening in civilised countries. It is very unfortunate that government has no answer to our security challenges\u201d. \u201cNigerians are disappointed with the failure of the government to fix the security problems. They should use their energy to pursue the criminals around us\u201d. (not chase well meaning critics) \u201cThe government should wake up and chase all these criminals out of the country. These killings are unprecedented\u201d \u2013 Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, S.A. (Media to CAN President.\n\n\u201cNigeria is losing it. The country is heading in the wrong direction. That\u2019s what Nigerians themselves are saying within and without the country. And that\u2019s what the international community is saying as revealed in several international assessments of the country\u2019s situation and the quality of governance. There has never been such a convergence of calls from the immediate stakeholders and international observers for urgent solutions to the country\u2019s multiple problems. The fears are palpable that a major disaster is imminent if nothing is done to address the problems\u201d \u2013 Prof Niyi Akinnaso.\n\nAs at the last count Islamic State-West Africa Province (ISWAP) and its aligned groups including Boko Haram, are believed to have killed no less than 36,000 Nigerians and forced more than two million to flee their homes, turning them to Internally Displaced Persons in their own country.\n\nOne cannot but sympathise with the President who swore to make the security of the lives and property of Nigerians his primary responsibility. President Muhammadu Buhari is not growing younger and it terribly gnaws one\u2019s heart that he must have lost some pretty sleep. Unfortunately, that does not seem like ending soon, as our tormentors \u2013 Boko Haram, Bandits, murderous local and foreign Fulani herdsmen \u2013 are all getting more audacious- attacking military formations, ambushing our soldiers as a result of too many fifth columnists within the local population which is often more in sympathy with the enemy because of religious and ethnic consaingunity.\n\nNo thanks to many of the President\u2019s actions, and inactions, since he became President six years ago. Even if his actions are the immediate causative factors of Nigeria\u2019s current challenges he, not being God, could not have foreseen all these terrible consequences they have brought us. Since he can, therefore, not be held solely responsible, let us examine the other factors that may very soon lead all of us all the way to Golgotha. Islam is, without question, a religion of peace. However, let us see how Nigerians have allowed religious, and ethnic considerations to exacerbate insecurity in the country. I quote a leading Nigerian newspaper report on the matter:\u201dabout 400 suspects arrested for funding Boko Haram and bandits, will soon face trial. They were arrested in an operation coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency, the DSS, and the NFIU. They were arrested, the report goes on, in Kano, Borno, Abuja, Adamawa, Kaduna and Zamfara, and are from a list of 957 suspects comprising bureau de change operators, gold miners and sellers\u201d. These, as we are all aware, are businesses owned 100% by Northerners and nearly all of them Muslims. Before drawing our conclusions, what about those selfsame intelligence agencies which are now reported to have investigated them? Can they call the Almighty Allah as their witness, and say they were knowing the sources of Boko Haram\u2019s funding for the first time since 2009? Is it the Central Bank, like these other agencies mostly dominated by Northerners, that can claim that its officers knew nothing about how Boko Haram were being financed in over a decade? The same goes for the Nigerian police which will not be worth its name, at all, if successive Inspector- Generals since 2009, as well as those officers who headed its secret and investigative departments, now claim that this is Greek to them.\n\nLargely because the objectives of these terrorists are coterminus with the hopes and aspirations of those high ranking government officials, , especially in the past six years when nearly all top appointments were deliberately made from the North, it has been a question of keeping our secrets, secret. After all some Northern leaders are on record as saying that an attack on Boko Haram, and may be on bandits too, is an attack on the North.\n\nOne can only imagine now, how Boko Haram would have been so definitively decimated had its funding dried up in the past six years or earlier. Government would not be feeling so insecure today, it would be claiming that some people are plotting to bring it down.\n\nTo have even as much as suggest that, is to demonstrate unquantifiable ignorance regarding the factors that trigger coups in Nigeria which were both political and economic.\n\nExcept the very first one, aka the Nzegwu coup of January 15, 1966, all the coups in Nigeria were led by Northern officers and were intended to locate power in the hands of Northern miltary officers and, ipso facto, in the North. Since the incumbent Head of state is from the North, this factor cannot hold water now.\n\nThe economic factor was also intended to put control of oil, in Northern hands, and thereby, attract to that region, whatever caught the fancy of those soldiers in office. At the personal level though, some of these officers emerged literally as rich as Bill Gates, with eye popping mansions, besides their massive investments abroad to show for it. Since his death on 8 June, 1998 till date, Abacha loot continues to be returned to Nigeria. Indeed, only this past week, it was announced that another tranch of \u00a34.2M was being expected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the economic factor too has become history; not only because oil is no longer what it used to be \u2013 it even traded negatively on the New York stock exchange in 2019/20, no sensible soldier would today dare Niger Delta militants who would ensure that everything goes up in flame within a week of such take over.\n\nThe Buhari government should, in its own interest, perish this chimera of an incubating coup and face the serious business of ruling Nigeria fairly and equitably, find creative ways of providing employment opportunities for the teeming millions of unemployed Nigerian youth, completely end Almajirai which Dr Akinwumi Adesina of the African Development Bank, not too long ago, described as the terrorists\u2019 recruitment supermarket and, rather than continue to print money to spoon feed states, set about genuinely restructuring Nigeria so that each constituent part can live within its means.\n\nI may be wrong but I have always had this finnicky feeling that Presidenf Buhari is not interested in restructuring and, as Head of state, would not even read the report of the 2014 National Confab, only because he shares the mindset of the Fulani National Movement that Nigeria is Allah\u2019s gift to Fulanis to have, and to dominate. Only this can fully explain his mode of appointments, or how else can Northern Moslems almost completely dominate the country\u2019s security apparatti? It is, without a doubt, an unabashed intent to cast in stone, the domination of Nigeria by its tiniest major ethnic group, the Fulani. It was particularly heartwarming listening to , not just any Northerner, but a highly enlightened one, an APC stakeholder to boot, and former Kano state commissioner for Works, Engr Muazu Magaji, express not too dissimilar views from these on Channel\u2019s TV\u2019s Sunrise Daily programme on Thursday, 7 May, 2021.\n\nWhat then has been the consequences on Nigeria, but particularly on the North, of several individuals, and groups, giving Boko Haram and banditry a life support just so it could overthrow the existing government and establish an Islamic state which is its objective and why it cant stop killing?\n\nThese consequences have been huge, beginning from how it has exposed many Nigerian soldiers to real danger, even death. Although the military has since warned Sheik Gumi not to dichotomise the Nigerian army with his claim that it is Christian soldiers who are killing bandits, the truth is that many Northern Moslems believe this bunkum. After all, he is a cleric, daily preaching to many people, some of who take his word as indisputable truth.\n\nBut there are much more ominous consequences, among them the possibility of the entire North being over run by Boko Haram/ ISWA, bandits etc.\n\nThe following scenarios do not completely capture all that is currently happening in the North, on top of the daily killings and kidnapping.\n\nWhile Borno state, the epicentre of Boko Haram attacks, is permanently under threat of attack, with hordes of civilians being killed Bauchi, hitherto regarded as peaceful, was allegedly attacked last week by Boko Haram.\n\nIn Gombe, about 10,000 people were reported displaced after sustained attacks in Geidam.\n\nDiscussing insecurity in Katsina, Kaduna, Zamfara and Niger states where kidnapping students have become something of a booming business, will amount to a sheer waste of quality time.\n\nLike his Borno state counterpart, the Nasarawa state governor, Engr Abdullahi Sule, has many times ran to the Villa to inform the President that Boko Haram was intent on making Nasarawa a base. Referencing that last week, Gbenga Olawepo -Hashim advised that Nigeria should take immediate steps to halt the advancement of enemy forces that are already amassed in Shiroro, Niger state, and pushing towards Nasarawa state, adding that the enemy\u2019s agenda is to encircle Abuja and capture the Federal capital territory, thus somewhat echoing this article\u2019s lietmotif.\n\nThe presidency should, in view of all these, see terrorism, not politicians or religious leaders as its real enemy and that the antidote is to tame, or better still, completely extirpate it..\n\nOne other consequence that has become obvious is that kidnapping has become a very lucrative business which has the possibility of getting registered on the Nigerian stock exchange as long as a very important Northern Sheik will not stop sending mothers of kidnapped students to a certain Ahmed, a Fulani, to negotiate ransom payments, but would also be strenously urging the Federal government, according to a Punch publication, to pay one Sani Idris Jalingo, the serial murderer who kidnapped the Greenfield University students, a N100M ransom.\n\nAll these should be enough to tell the Buhari government that there is much more to terrorism and that because Boko Haram and bandits, as well as murderous Fulani herdsmen, have all literally encircled the North we may wake up one morning soon, only to discover that the entire North has been run over by terrorists, even though, possibly to the admiration of many.\n\nFROM A PATRIOT, Nasir Jajere.\n\nTelecoms.\n\nIf kidnappers freely use mobile phones in negotiating ransom, why are their calls not traced? If the government doesn\u2019t have the capacity for cell phone triangulation, can it not deploy its regulatory powers to request for cell tower triangulation info. from the telecos, once a kidnap case is reported? And where calls are traced, why are the SIMs left active during and after the incident, especially if they belong to the criminals? Also, why is the government not slamming the telecos a N10m per minute penalty on every unregistered SIM card used by kidnappers?",

          "title": "Elite nationalism and the salvation of Nigeria",
          "text": "By Tunji Olaopa\n\nElite theory does not often sit very well with democratic aspirations. And the simple reason is that the political elites often define their interests in ways that are antithetical to the demands of the people on whose behalf they are often called upon to make political judgments that orient national policies. Hilary Clinton puts it as bluntly as she could: \u201cIt is a fact that around the world the elites of every country are making money.\u201d This statement is meant to signal the enormous doubt that attends the character of the political class across the world. Even in democracies, it is the political elites that form the fulcrum of the decision-making process on behalf of the people. They are the set of representatives that stand in the place of the demos, and are meant to make informed decisions that conduce to well-being and human flourishing. And this then implies that when the ship of state is faltering\u2014when governance refuses to be good\u2014we must ask the political elites. But then, if these so-called elites are sidetracked by the greedy and egoistic act of \u201cmaking money,\u201d of promoting their own interests at the expense of the people, then there is a lot to be said for the pessimism about their capacity to birth genuine nation-building and national development.\n\nThis essentially is the angst against the national elite in Nigeria. All across the world, elite nationalism has a fundamental role to play in not only the birthing of a nation but also in keeping that nation together, stable and progressive. It becomes something of a national duty on the African continent where the national political class played a significant role in the anticolonial campaigns that led to the official shutdown of colonization. And yet, independence brought an ambivalent reaction that increasingly undermined the imperatives of elite responsibilities to a state. This is so because there was created a terrible hiatus between the aspirations created by the rhetoric of anticolonialism and the realities of postcolonial statehood. The emergence of the state in Africa was accompanied by the hope that it would become a capable democratic developmental state that could deliver the strategic framework to (a) implement sound macroeconomic policies that could alleviate poverty, create employment, and grow a strong, sustainable and competitive economy that could facilitate the well-being of the citizens, (b) promote popular participation that can lead to the indigenous ownership of the development agenda, (c) build a sound institution of public administration that is professional, citizen-friendly, technology-enabled and meritocratic, with a capability readiness to efficiently achieve service delivery, and (d) mobilize state resources, administer budgets and manage public finances productively, transparently and accountably.\n\nThis was the task that was faced by Singapore, as a third world country. An apocryphal quote is often ascribed to Lee Kwan Yew that signaled the direction he decided to take, that eventually led to the transformation of Singapore from a third to a first world country. He was alleged to have said: \u201cThere were two options for me. Either I get corrupted and put my family in the Forbes list of the richest people in the world and leave my people with nothing. Or, I serve my country, my people and let my country be in the list of the best ten economies in the world. I chose the second option.\u201d The first option is then often left to symbolically denote the options taken by the political elites of countries that failed to go the path of Singapore and Lee Kwan Yew. Is this not the path that the Nigerian political elites took since independence?\n\nBut this supposed response must be contextualized. No one will fail to recognize some commendable but significant nation-building efforts of the political elites from independence that we like to conceptualize in discourse today as \u2018pockets of effectiveness\u2019. I can signpost a few that readily come to mind. First, I take it that no politically conscious Nigerian, with a deep sense of Nigeria\u2019s administrative history, will doubt the huge political inputs that went into the infrastructural transformation of the regions after independence. Regionalism and the regional competitiveness that were supervised by Awolowo, Bello and Azikiwe defined the very essence of Nigeria\u2019s federalism post-1960. The old western region, under the political-administrative determination of Awolowo and Adebo, became a reference point in elite cooperation and visioneering. And this was all despite corrosive political climate that was already tending towards war.\n\nBut then, and second, the civil war turned out to be an occasion for an administrative dexterity and clear-headedness that was still dedicated to the developmental progress of the country even though war was still raging. And then when military became the norm, we can still reference the Murtala-Obasanjo and Buhari-Idiagbon regimes, and the determined war of the political class against corruption and indiscipline. With the Babangida administration, there was a clear-cut governance template that gave concession to talents, professionalism and meritocracy in using world-acclaimed technocrats and the very best Nigerian intellectuals in the policy space. And when democracy dawned in 1999, there has been a series of governance efforts at institutionalization through consistent reform initiatives, from Obasanjo to Buhari.\n\nUnfortunately, the narrative has remained that of perpetual transitioning in quantum paces that never added up to any critical boiling point that crystallizes into genuine national transformation. And this becomes more frightening because our national dynamics are getting more complicated, complexified and seemingly irresolvable. We just need to scrutinize the unraveling insecurity, misgovernance and underdevelopment in the country, and the blatant complicity of the political elites in the situation. This line of thought points us back to fundamentals. For instance, what is the meaning and objective of political power? Essentially, political power is meant to be deployed as a significant transformational, rather than transactional, force that gets a state or a people from one alpha point to another and better omega point. Political power becomes therefore the critical motivation for social change and reconstruction in a state. When politicians win political power, it is meant to be deployed, on behalf of the people, to achieve democratic aspirations and developmental imperatives.\n\nBut then political power corrupts, and often absolutely. Politicians, even those who understand what power could achieve, have bent it towards nefarious and selfish interests that undermine the transformational capacities of power and made it a transactional framework for limiting the well-being of the people. The most fundamental misuse of political power in Nigeria is the palpable absence of a strong and coherent ideological framework around which political power can then serve as a firm machinery for getting the objectives of nation building and development working. In this sense, an ideology is a prism through which national ideas, beliefs and action blueprints are refracted and modulated. And the ideological differences between two or more parties within a democracy ought to serve as ideational alternatives that demonstrate different but focused ways to a state\u2019s future greatness. When one political party wins election, and hence the legitimate use of political power, the ultimate beneficiary of that victory ought to be the people on whose behalf the political power ought to be deployed. All ideological road ought to lead to the empowerment and flourishing of the citizenry.\n\nAlas, the political elites in Nigeria lack an ideological coherence that ought to motivate party politics. On the other hand, political parties and their ideological frameworks also represent development paradigms. This is one essential lesson we learnt from the early nationalists in the First Republic. Awolowo\u2019s Action Group and later Unity Party of Nigeria were founded around the ideology of democratic socialism and its vision of development for the people. This led to the policy choices that birthed infrastructural development. Azikiwe\u2019s party orientation hinged around the ideology of neo-welfarism, and the ethical responsibility of the state to provide a level playing field for citizens to achieve self-realization through the state\u2019s provision of essentially goods and services. The question is: what are the reigning ideological fault-lines along which we can begin to recalibrate Nigeria\u2019s development? The absence of a serious ideological dynamic could only mean that political power would fail to orient the political class to its fundamental responsibility on behalf of the people. Elite nationalism speaks to the capacity of the elite to create a nationalist space that will serve as the cauldron for generating ideas and action plans that the people can rally round.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis brings me to another fundamental issue that has undermined the capacity of the Nigerian political elite to become a force for nationalist transformation. This is the issue of progressive engagement and collaboration. The nationalist capacity of the political class anywhere is often attached to the fervent heroism of the people to believe the agenda of the political parties and to run with it. This means that the imperative of transformational politics demand that the political elite, to achieve a nationalism that will capture the imagination of the people, need to be in progressive collaboration with those elements of the democratic space, especially the civil society, that could be drawn into the ideological discourse on how political power could be used and deployed for the betterment of the state. Nationalism is founded on the developmental agenda that the political elite is able to put together that will transform into infrastructural development and the provision of public goods which then serve as the basis for the sense of belonging that the citizens begin to feel for one another and for the leadership of the state.\n\nIf elite nationalism will save the Nigerian state, it must have a populist cum patriotic self-justifying dimension that will submit the development agenda of the political elite to the parliament of the citizens through an ideological salesmanship in the political agora. The Nigerian citizens are politically sophisticated sufficiently, in spite of the stultifying stomach infrastructure drawback, to be able to determine which set of political elites they want to commit the next four years of their lives, and the template of their well-being to.\n\nBy Prof. Tunji Olaopa\n\nRetired Federal Permanent Secretary\n\n& Directing Staff, National Institute\n\nFor Policy and Strategic Studies\n\n(NIPSS), Kuru, Jos\n\n[email protected]",

When their children were finally released last Wednesday after Sheikh Ahmad Gumi and ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo intervened, the police led them to be received by the Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai. It is not clear why they dignified the governor with the honour of receiving the 27 students that remained in captivity after 10 had earlier been released and two had escaped. But given what he had to say about the experience of the bedraggled students abandoned to the caprices of their abductors, it was obvious the governor was in a dilemma. He had abjured his belief in negotiation or payment of ransom for victims of kidnapping, insisting that such approach encouraged the crime; but beyond that, the governor was flat-footed, even bellicose, in bringing the infamous abduction to an end.\n\nTongue-tied and obviously unsure what to say or how he should calibrate his enthusiasm in order not to betray his disinterest in the whole saga, the governor, according to Samuel Aruwan, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, \u201ccharged them (the students) to view their ordeal as a motivator to put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead.\u201d Whether the audience made any sense of the governor\u2019s suggestion is unknown. They were probably too glad to see the end of the tragedy to care whether the governor was enthusiastic about the release or made any sense in his admonition. Except newspapers cruelly abridged the governor\u2019s remarks, it was impossible to see any enthusiasm in his statements. But perhaps he had justifiable reasons to suggest to the students to let their ordeal be a motivator for their future.\n\nNo one is ever going to make sense of the \u2018motivator\u2019 suggestion. Not only was it inappropriate, it was also even hard to place or interpret in the context of the gruelling deprivation the students suffered at the hands of their abductors while the governor theorised about the usefulness of negotiation as a tool for resolving abduction, and the inapplicability of ransom. By casually suggesting to the students to put their ordeal behind them and look forward to a happier future, the governor made light of the trauma they must be experiencing and the scarification the brutality of their abductors must have occasioned. For about 56 days, the students were numbed by how their government, at federal and state levels, engaged in hand-wringing and dithering, perhaps also wondering whether their fate would not end up like that of the over 100 forgotten and abandoned Chibok schoolgirls or Leah Sharibu.\n\nThankfully, Mallam el-Rufai did not say anything about his earlier abominable threat to prosecute anyone negotiating with kidnappers, be they intermediaries or parents. Weeks ago, when the abduction threatened to be prolonged, and seeing that the government was too impotent to do anything but theorise, grieving parents swore to defy the governor as well as dared to be prosecuted for negotiating with the abductors. They were prepared to give their lives for their children if it came to that, convinced that the governor read the riot act about not negotiating with the bandits out of ignorance or misguided self-importance and bureaucratic high-mindedness. The governor had sworn to crush and exterminate the bandits, but it was clear to everyone, including the affected parents, that he was all bark and no bite. In the end, not only did parents reach out to the bandits, they also pressured influential and well-meaning individuals to wade into the matter. Chief Obasanjo and Sheikh Gumi finally brushed aside the state\u2019s misgivings and negotiated the release of the students last week.\n\nThere were indications by those close to the negotiations that additional ransom was paid, some N15m, and that a prisoner exchange also took place. Judging from the harrowing looks on the faces of the released students, their parents and the rest of the country must have heaved a great sigh of relief that the students were finally free. So much for the Kaduna policy. There are suggestions that overall, some N32m ransom was paid, after the first installment of N17m, and a bandit previously incarcerated in Kano was released. Parents of the five murdered Greenfield University students (another set of abductions) would have gladly offered much more, if they had the means. Why the Kaduna State government overlooked the emotional part of the saga is hard to fathom. However, both Mallam el-Rufai and Chief Obasanjo continue to waffle over the appropriateness of ransom, believing that it encouraged kidnapping, and that it was counterproductive to engage in it. Chief Obasanjo more realistically shifted ground by suggesting a stick and carrot approach. Mallam el-Rufai adamantly preferred to bluff the bandits, thus turning the abducted students into guinea pigs. Sheikh Gumi was probably the most sensible of the three. He suggested that negotiations be entered into and ransom paid, after which the government, by subterfuge, should descend heavily on the abductors.\n\nThere will of course be more abductions, for the government which should make the crime unattractive and even impossible to carry out, has proved embarrassingly impotent. By failing to put security measures in place to prevent or combat abduction, they incentivise the crime. And by failing to negotiate or pay ransom in the absence of any other coherent policy on the crime, they indicate that human life means nothing to them. No elite anywhere else in the world can be more callous and irresponsible. They can\u2019t have their cake and eat it. Hopefully, the burdened people of Nigeria will vote their next set of leaders more responsibly. The current set has no clue, no energy and no feelings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFederal, states bereft of ideas on abduction\n\nThe forum of parents of the 39 abducted forestry mechanization students may not be radicals, but they do not lack resoluteness and commonsense. In their formal statement of appreciation to those who facilitated the release of their children from the camps of bandits who seized them on March 11, they listed a number of people who worked tirelessly for that noble cause. They were careful not to mention the presidency or the Kaduna State government. It is not clear yet who influenced whom, whether Kaduna took a cue from the feds or vice versa, but there is no dispute about whether both had a policy on kidnapping, negotiation and ransom. One aped the other, and both consequently became paralysed by their own lack of policy.\n\nIn their statements celebrating the return of the abducted students, the presidency and Kaduna were both subdued in their emotions. \u201cWe are happy they have been released,\u201d said the presidency through Garba Shehu, while also thanking those who facilitated the release, \u201cin particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State. We thank Nigerians for their prayers.\u201d Subdued and shamefaced. How did the defence and security agencies play significant role? For Kaduna, this was how they expressed their own gratitude: \u201cThe Kaduna State Police Command has reported to the Kaduna State Government the release of the remaining students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation. The government rejoices with the freed students, their families and the management of the institution over this development. Governor Nasir El-Rufai charged them to view their ordeal as a motivator to put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead.\u201d\n\nKaduna was more truthful. The police reported the release, they moaned. Were they by any chance waiting for the negotiation to go awry, and possibly for the bandits to lose their cool, in order to demonstrate how tough the state and feds are? Well, whether they like it or not, abductions will not end soon, and they had better save whatever is left of their honour by developing a coherent and workable policy on the crime. They must not assume that they can still not be made to pay a huge political price for their callousness and neglect.",

In an encounter with Saturday Sun, the Ozubulu-Anambra State-born Ekezie couldn\u2019t hide her frustrations.\n\nShe confessed: \u201cI\u2019m not into any serious relationship right now. I\u2019m single and available! My kind of man? I\u2019m not bothered about physical look but you wouldn\u2019t be looking like a masquerade either. I want a good-looking guy, with average (height). He must be ready to accept me for who I am, and my career as well. Also, his brain and how his mind functions are more important to me.\u201d\n\nAnd what of his pockets? \u201cThat one is so important,\u201d Ekezie responded. \u201cI\u2019m not looking out to marry a Dangote but my man must be comfortable. He has to be able to provide for me. These are the issues.\u201d\n\nLending her voice to the rate at which celebrities fake luxurious lifestyles on the Internet, the actress begs to differ. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to fake it or pretend. I can\u2019t even snap (a picture) beside someone\u2019s car because there is no gain in it. I\u2019m honest to a fault. However, society expects more from us as celebrities. So, a lot of actors are pressured by society. Nigerians are conflicted; they want you to be humble, then the next minute, they complain that you are too modest. Women often create these problems. So, if people tend to live fake lifestyles, I won\u2019t blame them. They have to meet up.\u201d",

          "title": "Those around Buhari are leading him the wrong way \u2013Ahamba",
          "text": "Elder statesman and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ahamba has accused those around President Muhammadu Buhari of leading him down the wrong path.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, Ahamba also reminded the Igbo not to expect anyone to donate the presidency to them in 2023, even as he charged them to go all out and fight to make an Igbo man president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nMany people conclude that the Buhari government has failed. You were an associate of Buhari, or you worked with him sometime ago. Is this the Buhari you knew? What do you think changed?\n\nThe difference is that, we wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen, but those who got into government with him allowed it to happen. This is the Buhari I knew, but the problem is the people surrounding him, who want him to go the wrong way. When we were with him, we all wanted him to go the right way, but ethnic interests informed the exit of some of us because some people around him didn\u2019t allow some of us to remain with him because they know we would intervene and would not allow such things to happen. I had no quarrel with him. We didn\u2019t disagree on anything. We were just manipulated out.\n\nINEC has released the election timetable for the 2023 general elections. Some are saying certain parts of the country, like the South-East, should have it, while some others think otherwise. What is your candid opinion on this?\n\nMy candid opinion is that in this type of situation where there is no provision about rotation in the constitution, the interest of the nation demands that each part of Nigeria be given a chance. It is on that ground that I said it is best if the South-East is given a chance, not as of right, but in terms of equity and to bring peace and justice to the country.\n\nWhether they will do it or not depends on how they vote on that day. Let the candidates from South-East who want to be president move out as others are moving out and let us start assessing them. It cannot be donated. Nobody will donate presidency to the South-East. You have to fight for it. But I have not seen any candidate yet.\n\nNigeria is witnessing very challenging times, with insecurity in many parts of the country. What gave rise to this?\n\nThere is complacency in governance. Not hitting the iron while it was hot is a reason for this problem. Delay of action is dangerous, so we are just having the result of delay of action. These things have shown that they will happen in the last two or three years. Nobody did anything about them and they matured.\n\nPeople are saying that with the high level of insecurity, 2023 elections may not hold. If that comes to being what is the implication, because the tenure of this government elapses by 2023?\n\nMy granddaughter was asked by her grandmother what happened about something. The little girl asked the grandmother ,\u2018am I God?\u2019 How will I know what will happen, am I God? Let\u2019s see whether it holds or not.\n\nThen what is the legal implication if it doesn\u2019t hold?\n\nThere are provisions in the constitution about that. When that time comes, I think the Attorney General will give the relevant advice, while private lawyers will challenge or support the advice.\n\nThe Federal Government is alleging that there is a plot to overthrow the government of President Buhari. Is this a pointer that the APC government is not doing well or might have fallen out of favour with the people?\n\nThe government wants to create an opportunity to destabilise the opposition by making them suspects of a non-existence offence. That is all. I don\u2019t know what type of a security organ that will tell you that there is a plot to topple government, instead of getting ready to nip it in the bud. Last year December, there was crisis over the invasion of the Capitol in Washington DC. The security arm discovered it and reported to the appropriate body and they nipped it in the bud and it never happened.\n\nHere, we now shout it so that we can arrest innocent people and demand money from them. We have a problem in this country. If they were sharp enough to discover that there was a plot, you nip it in the bud; you don\u2019t go and allow it to happen so that you can punish people or start punishing people without it happening. I learnt the other day they were saying that they would be arresting probable people planning to destabilise the state; that they will start arresting them at home. So, if I\u2019m in my house and you are in your house and you stay there and imagine that I\u2019m plotting something, you will come to my house and arrest me because I\u2019m planning to do what is in my mind. I\u2019m a lawyer, and I know that you don\u2019t talk about a thing until a step is taken relevant to that offence you said happened.\n\nIf there is anarchy everywhere and people are complaining, is that a plot? Even the person giving the warning has seen that there is trouble. Why is he saying that somebody wants to create trouble? Can we create a worse trouble than the one we have now? All this is a mark of incompetence; they should put competent people in place. A lot of square pegs have been forced into round holes, which is part of the problems we have in this nation.\n\nSome Igbo people say, based on what the country is passing through under President Buhari, that they have been vindicated for not voting for him all along, even when he had Igbo running mates. Do you share same sentiments?\n\nDid he score 100 per cent in other places? He didn\u2019t, which means that there were Hausa-Fulani who didn\u2019t vote for him. The issue was that, who was the candidate? They preferred a candidate. It has nothing to do with ethnic or anything. At that time, they preferred a candidate to him. It is not a question of being vindicated because you didn\u2019t vote for Buhari; I reject that because I\u2019m an Igbo man, a prominent one for that matter. It was not true that anybody was against him. The issue I think was a preferred candidate at that material time and I campaigned against that position at that time. It is a political game; there is no vindication about it at all.\n\nEven when he had great Igbo men and others like you and his running mates who were also Igbo?\n\nIt depends on who he chose as running mates. Maybe if he had chosen other persons as running mates, it could have been better. I remember at that time there was hardly an election; votes were declared even when voting was going on. That was the era. I did the election petition and I have the documents; if you challenge me, I will bring the documents.\n\nDo you mean that Buhari could have won that election?\n\nEven if he did not win, he was not fairly treated at those elections.\n\nWhen you open pages or newspapers, the social media, what you read is, Nigeria is breaking up, or Nigeria will break up? Why are we having such fears at this time when other nations are conquering other planets?\n\nBreaking up of Nigeria, is it a plate? It is not easy to break up. Nigeria can disintegrate, everybody going his own way because the centre cannot hold. It is true that our constitution says that Nigeria is indissoluble. Whether it is dissoluble or indissoluble is a human act towards a project. That one may never happen, but disintegration is uncontrolled, but that shouldn\u2019t occupy our minds. What should occupy our minds is what to do to prevent it and move forward. Look at India, when I was in secondary school, they used to come here with degrees and we employed them in our secondary schools and paid them higher school salaries and now, we are running there for many things. What is wrong with us?\n\nAre you sure a worst Nigeria will not come into the disintegrated areas? You can disintegrate and in each component you have a good portion of Nigeria attitude inside it. It is the same thing. There may be worst Nigeria in the disintegrated areas. So let us solve it now that we are together. I believe that the only answer is to allow the areas some air of ability to do things for themselves at their own rate, not saying that the whole Nigeria must move at the same rate every time. Take for example, people say they want true federation, but they want salary to be the same everywhere. It can\u2019t happen in a true federation. It is not possible for some states to pay what Lagos can pay; some states cannot pay what Rivers or Kano states can pay. In a true federation, things should be according to those areas, but the Nigerian Labour Congress said it would destabilise Nigeria if you go to true federation with labour matters. People say they want true federation, yet they want the Federal Government to fund local governments while the states create the local governments. This is incongruous. If we want true federalism, we will have it. If we don\u2019t want, we continue with what I call \u2018unitary federalism\u2019 which is a new trend in politics.\n\nIn this direction, are you calling for restructuring, but many are still confused over how it is going to be carried out?\n\nI stand for restructuring; I don\u2019t stand for secession of any part of Nigeria. Let us restructure and go back to our federation agreement. We agreed on certain things before we became a federation. Let us revisit those things and see the ones we can take now and there will be peace in this place.\n\nWhen the current leadership says restructuring is not an option, what other options do we have?\n\nWe keep crying and trying to get it right, but in the end, we may come to Chinua Achebe, \u2018Things Fall Apart\u2019 and in another book, \u2018The Centre Cannot Hold\u2019. When the centre cannot hold, things will fall apart.\n\nAs it is in Nigeria today, what are the consequences of things falling apart?\n\nIt portends anarchy because before instability, there will be anarchy. We can ill afford that.\n\nSome people hold the view that Britain is the architect of our woes. They say Nigeria remains the last experiment of the British government, as other nations they brought together have gone their separate ways, each enjoying peace. They mention India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and others. What do you say to this?\n\nI agree, but what we don\u2019t know is why they decided to remain together when others were going their ways, because there is nothing happening now that the leadership of those days didn\u2019t see. Look, Southern Cameroun was part of Nigeria and they quickly eased themselves off, but the others remained together. I asked at the National Conference that our elders have not told us why they remained together when others were going their ways. Until we get that question answered, we may not know why they continued. If you look at the constitution, you find out that as at the time we got independent, regions have prime ministers, not premiers and they have their own governors, apart from governors general. They had their own constitution, but in 1978, some people went to the Constituent Assembly. I don\u2019t know whether they understood what they were doing. They said they were creating a federal constitution and they said there is only one constitution, the national constitution. There we became a unitary federalism and now we are crying. We were doing parliamentary system, but they said it is presidential they wanted. When you have to send people for something, you send people that know the issue, but you find good tailors and good carpenters who know nothing about law being sent to constitutional conferences. I do not know what we have now that was not there then. What we have to do now is to find a solution. Let\u2019s stop talking of how we came to this point; let us find a solution to our present circumstance and find out how we can remain together because if we split in a disorganised manner, it will be very bad.\n\nTalking about the 1999 Constitution, many people argue that what was agreed on is not what we have in the constitution. They said then Head of State, Abdulasam Abubakar handed over the document to Prof Awual Yadudu, who doctored it and produced what we have now.\n\nI don\u2019t like this lamentation about the 1999 Constitution. It is 99 per cent of what was in the 1979 Constitution. Before you complain of the 1999 Constitution, you have to first complain of the 1979 Constitution. If the problem started with the 1979 Constitution, why do you allow it to continue in 1999? Who did you send to the Constituent Assembly? I keep saying it, why would you send people who don\u2019t know anything about constitution to represent you in a constitutional conference? Everything is political and here we are today. The question of accepting the 1979 Constitution and holding the 1999 Constitution as fraud is not acceptable to me because they are the same. If people scampered to go and occupy offices based on the constitution, why did they go there instead of rejecting the constitution and face the military? Silence is acceptance.\n\nBut when Obasanjo came into power, one of his advisers said as the military has been eased off, their next plan was to work on an acceptable constitution. But that never came to pass?\n\nIt is not easy. Those who said that never knew how tedious it is making a constitution in a civilian regime; it is not as easy as making it under a military regime. In an undeveloped country like ours where everything is selfishly considered, not nationally considered, it is not easy. It was a wrong move to accept it first and then reject it later. That was a cowardly approach to a situation.\n\nHow do we move forward?\n\nThe National Assembly has power to make laws for peace, order and good government in Nigeria. That is their jurisdiction. They should make a law creating a constitutional conference or a constituent assembly to give us another constitution. We need to sit down and discuss our problem. We need to sit and discuss this situation of somebody having the power to make appointment of one ethnic group, a minority for that matter, for the whole country. The National Assembly should know its responsibility. When a president or governor begins to act contrary to the constitution, they have a duty to remove him from office. But what do we have now? It is our party; it is not our party. They go there to worship party and not the peace, good, order of government that the constitution asks them to do. I can\u2019t do anything about that. I will only complain as I have been complaining. Where I see such a thing I will speak out and go back to my house. If we follow 60 per cent of what is in that constitution, there will be peace in Nigeria.\n\nYou said the National Assembly should make a law to set up a constitutional conference or constituent assembly that will midwife a new constitution. But they said there is no need for that as they were already there to amend the constitution.\n\nThey have no power to amend the constitution. Go to Section Nine, the word, \u2018alter\u2019. Not to alter or amend the constitution; they can alter any provision of the constitution but not to alter or amend the constitution. If you say there is no difference between alteration and amendment, it is not true. It is just like saying that there is no difference between epidemic and pandemic. One contains the other; they are not the same. They think they are doing the right thing, but they are derailing. All these going around in the name of constitutional amendments are just a waste of time.",

          "title": "Untold story of Rev Fr. Mbaka",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nFiery Catholic priest, Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka is in the eye of the storm. Thousands of worshipers and members of his Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), on Wednesday, took to the streets of Enugu in violent protest over the sudden disappearance of their Spiritual Director.\n\nAt the end of the protest, which lasted over four hours, property belonging to the Catholic Church, including the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, were destroyed.\n\nThe protest, which had never been witnessed in the state almost, led to anarchy in the town. It was quelled when the \u2018missing\u2019 Mbaka reappeared in a black SUV at about 2.50pm, urging his followers to go back to their homes or the Adoration Ground, that he was safe.\n\nBut before then, the residence of the bishop had been vandalized; windows were shattered while air conditioners were damaged. Even water installations were not spared. It took the intervention of some individuals to stop the house from being set ablaze.\n\nMbaka has been in the public eye for quite some time. In 2014, he had prophesised that General Muhammadu Buhari, then presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would defeat former President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 polls.\n\nHis prophecy drew the ire of many, especially in the old Eastern region where Jonathan had teeming supporters.\n\nBarely three years later, he spoke vehemently against the same Buhari\u2019s government that he had prayed for. He warned Nigerian leaders of a looming disaster, which he said would be sparked by the unmitigated bloodletting in the country, while calling on the President to go to Rome to atone for the human carnage going on in the country under his watch.\n\n\u201cSupernatural disaster is coming. Angels are already warming up. Nigerians should not worry; one day there will be vacancy from Abuja. The jet will park and nobody will use it unless they repent.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, had it been that it was the Imams that were killed in Benue or Plateau, the president would have attended their burials.\n\n\u201cGod can prophesy someone into a position. If you know how Nebuchadnezzar became the President. He went there under prophetic order. When God wants to punish His people, He can use a leader. The Nebucadnezzar God later pushed into the bush.\u201d\n\nHe further said that President Buhari was like an egg that was bound to meet a sledgehammer in the nearest future, charging those who were close to the president to ensure he got his message.\n\nHe called himself a microphone speaking as directed by God warning that anybody who would want to attack him because of the message would meet his waterloo.\n\nThat is Rev. Father Camillus Ejike Mbaka, Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry of Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nArguably, one of the most unconventional Catholic priests in Nigeria; Mbaka\u2019s methods and tactics have endeared him to many, with thousands of followers trooping to the adoration ground located at Umuchigbo, Iji Nike; Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State for spiritual encounter every Friday. For all the followership, Mbaka is no stranger to controversies; he rather seems at home with them. No wonder one can hardly think of any other priest that divides opinion more than the charismatic priest.\n\nIn fact, Mbaka said during the first physical service of his church after about five months of closure due to lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic that the country goes \u2018gaga\u2019 anytime he declares prophecies.\n\nHe said, \u201cLike you know, whenever we declare a prophecy here, the whole country goes gaga and they begin to plan evil. But woe betides whoever that should allow himself to be used to try any attack on me or this ministry.\n\n\u201cYou may not like me; I may not be among those you consider as good people, but I know that God is using me to save people and minister succour to mankind.\u201d\n\nFamily background and journey to priesthood\n\nFr. Mbaka is the only son of late Chief Humphrey and Felicia Mbaka. He hails from Amata Ituku in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Humphrey Mbaka\u2019s family stood out for their special talent in palm wine tapping in the community. Ejike as a child helped his father in his palm wine business. He was also close to his mother as he always helped out in domestic chores.\n\nDespite the demand of domestic activities, the young Mbaka also devoted time to Block Rosary. He stood out as one of the leaders of the group at St. Anthony\u2019s Parish, Ituku where he led the prayer team. His father, who was a traditional religion worshipper, seemed to have tolerated his tilt to Christianity until he declared his intention to enter priesthood. This was met with stiff resistance by his late father who allegedly made life a living hell for the intending priest.\n\nMbaka attended St. Vincent\u2019s Secondary School, Agbogugu in Awgu L.G.A of Enugu State, from where he proceeded to the Seat of Wisdom Seminary, Owerri, Imo State and St Joseph\u2019s Seminary Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom State, for his training as a priest. He was ordained a priest on July 29, 1995 and was subsequently posted to Holy Ghost Cathedral, headquarters of Catholic Church in Enugu Diocese as the Assistant Diocesan Administrator.\n\nHe later ventured out on evangelical missions to Capuchin; a religious order of Franciscan friars within the Catholic Church, and Government Technical College (GTC), Enugu, where he founded the Word Prayer Centre of the Eucharistic Jesus which later metamorphosed to the Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nIt was gathered that those early years of priesthood were unbearable for Mbaka as he would hold Mass at the GTC and shortly after the service; the church leadership would come and retrieve the offering. He was not allowed access to the offering; neither was he given accommodation.\n\nAt some point, he lived with a couple in their one-room apartment in the GRA; and most times slept in the car. It was from there that some members who saw the efficacy of his prayers rented a place for him before they eventually commenced putting up structures for the Christ the King\u2019s Parish (CKP), which hosted the adoration ground at the GRA.\n\nHuge crowds troop to the adoration ground every Friday from all parts of the country in search of spiritual encounter. The atmosphere is usually charged and electrifying such that one gets the exact buzz that goes with the Pentecostal fellowships.\n\nAccording to one of the choristers in the ministry, Oluchi Okolo, the singers usually have their works cut out for them as they are expected to sing and keep everyone \u201cin the realm of the spirit\u201d until the man of God arrives. She said once the man of God is sighted, the atmosphere becomes more intense and shouts of \u201cDaddy\u201d, \u201cOga Ndi Oga\u201d, \u201cNwa Ikuku\u201d, \u201c Onyeisi Okanga\u201d, \u201cOga Emma\u201d, and so many other appendages with which Mbaka is known rend the air. She described the feeling as blissful.\n\nThe all-night service proper at the Adoration Ground can best be described as Pentecostal-Catholicism. Without being told, a first time visitor will think he was in a Pentecostal gathering until it was time for the Holy Communion and the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDescribing worship at the Adoration Ground, an observer wrote: \u2018Worship here combines preaching, ecstatic Eucharistic adoration, two Masses, anointing and dance in a way that is hard to imagine for anyone who has not seen it before. Mbaka is a celebrity and a force in the entire South East region, supported by many followers and clergy.\u2019\n\nHowever, in 2016, Mbaka was transferred from the CKP where he had presided for 20 years to Our Lady\u2019s Catholic Church, Emene; a small parish in an obscure part of Enugu as an assistant priest.\n\nHis exit from CKP on January 31, 2016 was a highly emotional exercise as he was escorted by thousands of Catholic faithful in Enugu to his new parish.\n\nSeveral lorries, buses and cars all lined the street in what could be dubbed a triumphal exit that halted economic and other activities for over four hours along major streets where the long convoy passed.\n\nAddressing the crowd before the movement, Mbaka had expressed reservations over the transfer, which he said was calculated to make him suffer by certain leaders of the church.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know we are going to suffer within now and few months to come. I am going to suffer and suffer; I know that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to suffer because I have no place to put my head. I am going to suffer because I have no place to keep the Adoration Ministry\u2019s assets. I know I\u2019m going to suffer.\n\n\u201cFortunately, it is going to happen in the month of lent. So, I am going to use my exit here as a Lenten observance./ but Jesus said it all in John 16:20 to his apostles that you will be sorrowful and the world will be rejoicing but very soon I will turn your sorrow to joy.\n\n\u201cThe quantum of the assets of the Adoration Ministry is the only thing I am bothered about for now. Where am I going to keep them? I am going to stay in one small room that has only one small bed, one small table, little toilet and bathroom.\n\n\u201cSo, where am I going to keep all the Adoration assets? My clothing and books I can keep in the car or somebody\u2019s house but where will I keep these assets that I have given to the Catholic Church of Enugu? But I say may God take the glory and whoever that has offended me, I have forgiven.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fight anybody or even dream of battling anybody. If anybody allows the devil to use him, the same that advised you to make a mistake will laugh at you when you cry over the error. The baby is born, there is no going back.\n\n\u201cWe are moving out. We have been doing it and we will do it again.\u201d\n\nActually, many had thought that heavens would fall over the transfer. The manner the whole thing died down attracted the envy of former Vice President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop John Praise Daniel who extolled the legendary discipline in the orthodox Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cI know if it were in a Pentecostal church, a church would have started the following day. A man with over 30, 000 worshippers still agreed to leave everything to one small church. It\u2019s discipline,\u201d he had remarked.\n\nLife of giving\n\nIn early 2020, Fr. Mbaka shocked both his followers and non-followers alike when he disclosed that he spends about $2 million (over N700 million) monthly on charity works. The priest through his Multi-Live Savers for the Less Privileged has positively changed the lives of many indigent persons nationwide.\n\nDuring the event marking his 25th year of priestly ordination, one of his followers, Anita Ogonna, praised him saying: \u201cFr Mbaka, you are not a saint or the best among all, but I respect you so much in all your physical and spiritual doings, you are a man who converted his money for private jet to give many poor people a home, you converted your pomposity to give young people hope, you restored many even at the point of death. You did not consider your ministry as a competition with others. You are really a shadow of emulation, prophet of contentment, man of generosity, prophet of humility, prophet of the poor, one among the givers of our time\u201d.\n\nThe priest distributed over 4,000 bags of rice, condiments and clothes to less privileged members of the adoration family as part of his 2018 Christmas and New Year gifts.\n\nHaruna Ayuba who led a group of Northern Christians to the programme said: \u201cAll these good works and miracles of God through Fr Mbaka still confirm that in spite of all the attacks on him, the hand of God is still upon him and his ministry.\u201d\n\nHis many controversies\n\nMbaka is synonymous with controversies. From his frosty relationship with the then Governor of Enugu State, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani to the standoff with former President Goodluck Jonathan and then to the recent prophecy on the Imo State Governorship position, Mbaka\u2019s penchant for toeing paths other preachers would love to avoid could be clearly seen.\n\nNnamani was the first to taste the bitter pill from Mbaka. It was a tough eight years for the governor, as he found in Mbaka a man he could not handle. It was literally a battle of superiority between the two. Their friction got to its peak with the death of 14 worshippers following a stampede at the Adoration Ground; an incident Mbaka blamed on the then Governor. But Nnamani denied complicity in the incident and has continued to plead innocence till date.\n\nMbaka allegedly went ahead to prophesy that Nnamani would not win re-election in 2003. However, the governor won convincingly at the polls. He also contested and won a senatorial position in 2007 after serving his second term as governor.\n\nHis statements unarguably contributed to the failure of Chief Ikedi Ohakim to win re-election as governor of Imo State in 2011. The priest has since made up with the former governor.\n\nOn December 31, 2014, Mbaka shocked Nigerians, especially the entire South-East region as he prophesied against the re-election bid of the then President, Jonathan, whom he dubbed bad luck. In his New Year message for 2015, titled \u201cFrom good luck to bad luck,\u201d the priest tore the former president to shreds as he detailed his failure in tackling corruption and insecurity in the country.\n\nHe prophesied that the then opposition candidate, Buhari, would win at the polls. During the sermon at the Christ the King Catholic Parish, GRA, Enugu, Sunday, January 4, 2015, Mbaka said that he had been receiving threats.\n\n\u201cSurely, they shall gather, but because the gathering is not of God they shall scatter. No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper. They said Buhari gave me money, but I have never met with Buhari. I don\u2019t know him in person. I only delivered the message I was given and I stand by that message because the future of this country is bleak with Jonathan on the saddle,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the controversy raged; even many of Mbaka\u2019s staunch followers found it hard to accept it, with a lot of them suggesting that the priest had really dabbled into politics.\n\nOne of the celebrated attacks Mbaka received was a musical video by a local artiste known as BBC, titled: \u201cMbaka Why?\u201d The video further poured fuel into an already burning furnace. BBC went ahead to list a number of failed prophesies allegedly delivered by Mbaka and predicted that his prophecy against the president would fail likewise.\n\nMbaka\u2019s prophecy came to fruition as Jonathan was roundly defeated at the polls and the priest was vindicated.\n\nAnother controversial prophecy was the Imo State Governorship position which was at the time at the Supreme Court. The candidate of the PDP, Chief Emeka Ihedioha had won the election and was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) but Mbaka prophesied, even though Iheadioha had been sworn in as governor, that the candidate of the APC, Senator Hope Uzodimma would become governor of the state.\n\nMbaka advised those who might find the message unpalatable not to come after him, warning that such action would attract the wrath of the Holy Spirit upon such individuals.\n\n\u201cMany things are going to happen in Nigeria this 2020 that will shock countrymen and countrywomen; but all would be to God\u2019s glory. In spite of all that would happen this 2020, there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn Imo State, there is hope. Hope, hope, hope in Imo State! Imo people have suffered but God is raising a new hope that would be an agent of salvation for them. He\u2019s coming with a new flag to restore the dignity of that noble land.\n\n\u201cA new leadership that will break barriers and there would be joy in the land of Imo. Lift your candles as I bless Hope Uzodimma; and I empower him to, spiritually, to take over. How, I do not know.\n\n\u201cPlease, if you heard that there would be a new government in Imo and you don\u2019t like the message; if I say Hope, you can say hopeless but do not fight me.\n\n\u201cI am saying this in respect of those who may want to come after me because of the message. If you do that, the God of Moses, Elijah and Elisha will deal with you. I am only a messenger of God\u201d, he said.\n\nMany Nigerians, including priests, attacked Mbaka for making a prophecy that was at the time seen as impossible as they believed that Uzodimma did not even stand a chance even if Ihedioha should lose at the apex court.\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Imo State, and other religious leaders berated Mbaka over the prophecy insisting that it was politically motivated.\n\nAlso, the Imo State Chapter of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) in a statement in Owerri by its Chairman, Isidore Chukwuemeka, asked: \u201cWhere was Mbaka when Imo State was serially raped for eight years by a clueless administration that mindlessly looted the treasury of the state?\u201d\n\nEven after the prophecy was fulfilled, some people still continued their attack on Mbaka. Senior Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, Adewale Giwa said that he was not surprised to see the fulfilment of the prediction by Rev. Fr. Mbaka that Uzodimma would be declared Imo State Governor by the court as Mbaka was a partisan prophet, adding that he must have got the hint of the judgement before speaking.\n\nGiwa said: \u201cWhen a partisan prophet speaks, we surely know who gives him the hint. This is a concluded deal among them.\n\n\u201cIs it not the same prophet who enters Aso Rock, wining and dining with the President? We know where they all belong. Check my record, I stand by the truth at all times and the truth will eventually prevail in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMbaka later admitted that the prophecy was a risky one but cautioned people against attacking him or his prophesies. In a statement released weeks after Uzodimma was declared the substantive governor of Imo State.\n\n\u201cHelp me to correct the mendacious, heinous and horrendous impression given by the press over my relationship with my bishop. I have no problem with my bishop. Am I forgiving him for what? I didn\u2019t say that I have forgiven my bishop as they reported.\n\n\u201cI rather opined that I have forgiven all those who maligned me when I prophesied, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that Hope Uzodimma is going to be the governor of Imo state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary and secondary school, I had started seeing vision and doing mysterious things by God. Attacking me is a waste of time. That will not stop God in sending messages to me. So, you attackers, use your time and do meaningful something for yourself,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the wake of the crisis generated by Mbaka\u2019s prophecy, Bishop Callistus Onaga had instructed the Catholic faithful to disregard the prophecy.\n\nBut Mbaka had wondered why there was so much negative reaction to his Imo prophecy than when he prophesied late General Sani Abacha\u2019s death, late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death, as well as Buhari\u2019s take over from former President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cAll these came to pass, why is this one so catastrophic? Those who attacked me, who is now a loser? Is it you or me? Holy Spirit told me that Hope Uzodimma was going to become the governor of Imo State and I should obey God rather.\n\nHe cautioned the church and all those who were perturbed by his God\u2019s gift that they should know his gift did not just come when he became a priest.\n\nThe Catholic priest had on January 15, held the first thanksgiving for Uzodimma at the Adoration Ground, a day after the apex court sacked Ihedioha as governor.\n\nHis other controversies\n\nMbaka had described former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as Bureau de Change because of the mindboggling foreign currencies that reportedly exchanged hands at the last National Convention of the PDP in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, before he emerged the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2019 elections.\n\nRegardless, he warned him not to emulate Buhari if he was elected the president.\n\nMbaka stated that the President had all the human and materials resources at his disposal to make the country better but rather chose to play ethnic, despotic politics by surrounding himself with people without vision and not inclined to his line of thought. He noted that Buhari had wasted a golden opportunity offered him by God and by implication disobeyed God.\n\nHe also described the cost of the APC\u2019s expression of interest and nomination forms as outrageous; saying that if the leadership of the party had conscience, they would not have collected N24 million from people to obtain the forms. He added that a party with conscience would have returned the money to the aspirants instead of casting aspersions on them.\n\nAlthough Mbaka had predicted defeat for the ruling party in the elections but he said that there was still opportunity for change. He further warned Buhari that the \u201cprice of disobedience is disgrace.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if Atiku had the opportunity that the president has, he would have revamped Nigeria.\n\nEventually, when Buhari won the election, Mbaka said that Atiku had lost it in the spiritual realm the day he (Mbaka) apologised to his running mate, Obi.\n\nHe was to later celebrate President Buhari\u2019s victory in the Presidential polls on March 27; where he said that God had honoured his prophecy.\n\nMbaka said had the President lost in the polls, his ministry would have been closed down. \u201cBut our God is a humongous miracle. He has answered our prayers. I am happy. I am filled with joy. On this altar, we will decree and it will come to pass. Anybody I support will be victorious.\u201d\n\nHe declared that even if the Presidential polls were cancelled, Atiku and Obi would still lose a rerun because \u201cthe ways of God are not the ways of man. People should stop playing God\u201d.\n\nPrior to this period, the Human Rights Writers Association (HURIWA) had in January 2016, threatened to drag Mbaka to the Vatican following his prophecy on plots to kill Buhari. Leader of the group, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko had asked the Nigerian Catholic hierarchy to sanction the priest for abandoning his sacred vocation and deviating into the profane and mundane roadside career of high wire politics under the canopy of his Catholic\u2019s priestly vocation.\n\nVoice of the voiceless\n\nMbaka\u2019s closeness to Governor Ugwuanyi did not stop him from speaking out for the people as he openly decried the recent demolition of structures in Enugu by the Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority in its bid to restore the original master plan of the capital city.\n\nThe outspoken priest had described the action of the Enugu State Government as an atrocity against the people.\n\nAccording to him, the immensity of suffering and economic hardships in the country did not warrant the demolition of people\u2019s shops without giving them time, or providing alternative areas for them.\n\n\u201cIf you want to restore the master plan of 1933 in Enugu State, you should do it holistically. There are some areas where the master plan was flouted but because they belonged to the echelon political class, government is afraid of pulling the structures there down.\n\n\u201cWhat about Zoo Estate? The place that was made for animals\u2019 residence is now being harboured by human beings, so, you don\u2019t take justice one-sided; whoever errs must be punished. When I see you people destroying those ones, I now know that you are out to restore the original master plan of Enugu,\u201d Mbaka stated.\n\nMeanwhile mixed reactions have trailed the whole episode of his disappearance and reappearance. Former Federal Commissioner of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Executive Director of Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), blamed the diocesan bishop for allowing him the latitude of growing wings within the church.\n\nHe urged the Bishop of Enugu diocese to go ahead and close down the Adoration Ground, saying Mbaka should be defrocked and laicized if he became rebellious.\n\nOnwubiko said: \u201cI think the Bishop made a mistake to have allowed Rev Fr Mbaka to grow almost much bigger than his diocese by running his own ministry to the detriment of the core responsibilities for which he was ordained.\n\nIPOB seeks support for Mbaka\n\nMeanwhile, the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, in an audio broadcast has warned people from the South-East not to condemn the cleric.\n\nKanu reiterated that there are Nigerians like the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai who have grievous cases hanging on them, and appear to be sacred cows in Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cIn a normal country so to speak, the condemnation of Father Mbaka, you may welcome it somehow. I know sometimes regardless of our shortcomings, we are brutal in the way we think. We see what is bad and say it\u2019s bad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is doing it. That\u2019s why a lot of people came down heavily on Father Mbaka but I\u2019m telling you this, yes in Biafra, we can do anything we like to him. But, in Nigeria, as far as Nigeria is concerned, never ever condemn your own,\u201d Kanu said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld deregistration of 74 political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their inability to win any election after the 2019 general polls.\n\nJustice Adamu Jauro, who delivered the judgment of the apex court in a virtual court session on Friday, held that the deregistration of the affected political parties, including National Unity Party (NUP) was in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act. The judgment has to a large extent, sealed the fate of the remaining 73 parties many of whom have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. The Commission, which had on February 6, 2020, announced deregistration of the 74 political parties, hinged it on their failure to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitutional Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has determined that eighteen (18) political parties have fulfilled the requirements for an existence based on Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as follows,\u201d the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said. The Abuja division of the Federal High Court had in it\u2019s judgment, affirmed the power of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deregister political parties, which failed to comply with the provisions of the law particularly Section 225 A of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Justice Jauro, in his judgment delivered in the suit filed by the National Unity Party, one of the 74 parties deregistered by the INEC in February, affirmed that the constitutional power of the electoral commission and the reasons given by the Commission for deregistration of parties are valid, in conformity with the law, sacrosanct and could not be affected by the fact of anticipated Local government elections by some states, which dates were not fixed, certain or even ascertainable. The court, therefore, held that deregistration of National Unity Party as a political party in Nigeria was lawfully done in exercise of vested constitutional powers of the INEC in accordance with Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution. The judgment conclusively terminated the legal existence of the party and also all its other rights and obligations. With the ruling, all pending appeals by other deregistered parties are now an academic exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the judgment, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, hailed the judgment and said the judgment had ended all speculations and this will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.",

He maintained that, \u201cthe Nigerian Government had spent N1 billion dollars in acquiring weapons for the war against the insurgency it is facing.\n\n\u201cSome ignorant people say that they have not seen any weapon. I know where the weapons are. They are yet to come. We paid $496millon to the American government and it is getting to three years now, the Super Tucanos are yet to arrive. Last week, we received an email that it will come on July 21\u201d, he said.\n\nTo DICON, he said, \u201cmanpower development which you identified as one of the key points that encompasses training, is key to the success of DICON, especially where you will want to use research and development to chart the course of your success.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and the Ministry of Defence looks forward to seeing DICON attain a highly productive and profitable cooperation in our collective national desire to attain self-reliance and self-sufficiency in our defence and security needs,\u201d he said\n\nEarlier, the Executive Vice Chairman of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), Prof M S Haruna, who was represented at the event by Dr Ibrahim Onuwo Abdulmalik, called on business giants like Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola and others to support the Nigerian Industrial Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) for the security of their investments.\n\n\u201cIf we have the richest man in Africa on Nigerian soil, and he\u2019s not supporting DICON, maybe, we are not even talking to him. We are not talking to Dangote; we are not talking to Otedola and the rest of them. We must talk to them because if we are under threat of external aggressors, their investments are not safe,\u201d he said. In an address, the new Director-General of DICON, Major General Moses Uzoh noted that concerted efforts have been made in the past to achieve the objectives of DICON especially, as it relates to the establishment of a military-industrial complex in Nigeria.\n\nDICON was established in 1964 Act of Parliament to produce defence materials for members of the armed forces and other security agencies.",

          "title": "For Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi and Hadiza Bala-Usman, It\u2019s Personal",
          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe suspension of Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority last Thursday by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, against civil service rules for the removal of heads of MDAs, was the culmination of the personal desire of the minister to remove Hadiza and truncate her second term as Managing Director of agency.\n\nHadiza was not told what her offences were or formally communicated, before her suspension was announced by the presidency.\n\nNot querying her or making her aware of her offence(s) before suspending her is a clear breach of the processes stipulated in the government\u2019s own regulation for disciplining heads of government agencies. A government circular dated May 19, 2020, and endorsed by the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, stipulated that when there is an issue of impropriety against the head of an agency, the federal government requires a minister, through the permanent secretary of the supervising ministry, to refer the matter to the governing board of the affected agency in line with its enabling law and chapters three and 16 of the Public Service Rules on discipline in government parastatals.\n\nThe board will then issue the affected official a query and subsequently advise the minister of its findings and recommendations. But if the board itself is the source of the allegation of misconduct against the chief executive or the chief executive is the chairman of the board, the minister, on the advice of the permanent secretary, still has to ensure a query is issued, requesting an explanation from the accused official.\n\nIn this case, neither the governing board nor the SGF was carried along before action was taking against Hadiza.\n\nIn the beginning, it was all well between Amaechi and Hadiza, who closely worked together when the minister was DG of the Buhari campaign and Hadiza was a close confidant of candidate Buhari, resulting in Amaechi recommending her as MD of NPA. When Amaechi became transport minister, things began to degenerate when he found Hadiza too independent to rein her in or control and the suspended MD would not serve in his court full of political courtiers.\n\nThings came to a head when Amaechi wanted to renew all dredging contractors of NPA. Many of the contractors had served for decades and Amaechi got Hadiza to cancel her public advertisement for bid but was later overruled by the BPE, acting on the orders of the president that a public bid be held.\n\nThe crisis deepened from one contract to the other as Hadiza insisted on due process and more often had presidential backing to the anger of Amaechi, who then promised that Hadiza would be a one term MD. To the minister\u2019s shock and consternation, Hadiza got a second term without his input and since then vowed to oust her.\n\nThe first attempt was when Amaechi accused Hadiza and the NPA of not auditing their books and recommended KPMG Nigeria; Deloitte Nigeria; Price Water House Coopers, Ernst and Young and Mckinsey and Company Nigeria. The Auditor-General of the Federation informed Amaechi that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe Auditor General of the Federation also told the minister that the NPA was in compliance with yearly audit unlike other government agencies.\n\nFrom that, the crisis culminated into the issue over remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds between 2016 and 2020 to Consolidated Revenue Funds (CRF) and the CBN.\n\nBefore Hadiza could respond to the query to show that NPA had indeed been remitting to the CRF and the CBN, Amaechi got the President to approve her ouster without due process on the pretext that a panel had been set up to probe her management of then agency. Ironically, the person to act for her while on suspension is the Executive Director, Finance of NPA, Mohammed Koko, who was not suspended, despite the planned probe of NPA\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Minister alleged that the NPA under Hadiza could not account for N165.320 billion between 2018 and 2020 in the record of its remittance of operations surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds. Amaechi in a letter addressed to the office of the President on March this year, alleged that NPA\u2019s yearly remittance of operating surpluses from year 2016-2020 fell short of the actual amount due for actual remittance.\n\nAmaechi wrote: \u201cIn view of the above, I wish to suggest that the financial account of the activities of Nigerian Ports Authority be investigated for the period 2016-2020 to ascertain the true financial position and the outstanding unremitted balance of One hundred and sixty-five billion, three hundred and twenty million, nine hundred and sixty-two thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven naira only (N165,320,962,697).\u201d\n\nThe minister therefore sought that \u201cthe account and remittance of NPA in the period of 2018-2020 be audited to account for the gross shortfall of remitted public funds.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency, in a letter dated March 30, and which was signed by the Chief of Staff to the President granted the prayers of the Transport Minister on the need to audit the books of NPA\n\nHowever, there was a drama as the office of the Auditor General of the Federation clarified that the NPA Act did not give anyone the responsibility of authorising the Auditor General of the Federation to audit its accounts. It however explained that it is within the purview of the office of the Auditor General of the Federation to provide NPA with a list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors, among others.\n\nIn the memo signed by the Auditor-General of the Federation, the Transport Minister was informed that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe memo also said that both firms had audited and published the audited accounts of NPA as approved by the board for 2016, 2017 and 2018, adding that the audit of 2019 was ongoing, awaiting NPA\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the position of the AGF, Amaechi, through a memo issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Magdalene Ajani and addressed to the Auditor-General of the Federation, called for a holistic audit of all financial activities of the NPA and went further to list some selected audit firms for the job.\n\nThose familiar with the crisis said it has been a cat and mouse relationship between the Minister and the embattled chief executive of NPA, for over five years climaxing in the rejection of the record of NPA\u2019s remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the CRF.\n\nThe cat and mouse relationship between Amaechi and Hadiza was also fuelled by the suspicion that the executive director was too close to the supervising minister, a development that was said to have raised the fear that the director had been leaking some sensitive information especially of the finances of NPA to the Minister.\n\nKoko is known to be close to Amaechi in his days as governor of Rivers State. Koko was then a staff of Zenith Bank in Port Harcourt.\n\nThere was also the battle over the sack of Intels, a major contractor of NPA by Bala-Usman. The firm was a major sponsor of APC in the 2015 election and the transport minister was looking towards the firm for support in 2023. Amaechi wanted Intels badly but Hadiza denied him.\n\nPolitical Tweets\n\nBala-Usman finally played into the hands of those plotting her ouster with her recent political tweet on the state of the nation.\n\nReacting to the rising insecurity in the country, Hadiza on February 27, tweeted, \u201cThe state of insecurity in the country that has led to the kidnap of Kagara boys and Zamfara girls need to be addressed urgently\u2026We can\u2019t go on like this! Rescue our children and secure our country that\u2019s all we ask\u2026#SecureNorth #SecureNigeria.\u201d\n\nThe tweets caught the attention of her opponents who intensified moves to remove her for daring to take on a government which she served.\n\nPresident Buhari and her other sympathisers in the Presidency could no longer help her case when attention were called to the tweet which presented her as a sharp critic of the administration, who could no longer be trusted because of the suspicion that she might be working for the opposition.\n\nBala-Usman\u2019s last-Minute Efforts\n\nHowever, Bala-Usman, who got wind of the plot against her, had on Wednesday fired a memo addressed to the Chief of Staff to the President, stating her position and calling for involvement of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation to establish the true position of the authorities\u2019 remittances.\n\nIn the memo she personally signed, Bala-Usman explained that the Authority\u2019s computation of its remittances to the CFR are concluded arising from numbers from the audited financial statements using the template forwarded to the authority from the Fiscal Responsibility Commission and not budgetary provision.\n\nShe insisted that the NPA has remitted the full amount due it to CFR for the periods 2017 and 2018 arising from the operating surplus derived from the audited financial statement for the period totalling N76.384 billion as evidenced in treasury receipts.\n\nAccording to her, NPA had remitted a total of N82.687billion for the period 2019 and 2020 pending the audit of the financial statement at which point the amount so much computed arising from the value of the operating surplus to the audited financial statement will be remitted to the CFR.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that the Chief of Staff requests the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation who are the statutorily custodian of status of payment to the CRF to provide clartrue position of the Authorities remittances to the CFR,\u201d she submitted.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, pundits are wondering if President Buhari will discard his adopted daughter for an unreliable former governor of Rivers State who ditched his predecessor Peter Odili and not on speaking terms with his successor, Nyesom Wike.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says sack of 74 parties complied with extant provisions of Constitution, Electoral Act\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria yesterday put a final lid on the prospect of reinstating the 74 political parties deregistered by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for failure to win any elective position in the 2019 general election, when it ruled that the deregistration of one of the affected parties, National Unity Party (NUP), is constitutional.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous judgment delivered virtually by Justice Chima Nweze upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal which had earlier affirmed the deregistration of the NUP.\n\nBy this action, the apex court has sealed the fate of the remaining 73 deregistered parties, many of which have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.\n\nThe NUP had challenged its deregistration by INEC in line with the laws and in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act.\n\nIt noted that INEC \u201chas the legal power\u201d to deregister the affected political party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, by affirming the concurrent findings of the lower courts on the NUP case, has upheld not only the powers of INEC to deregister political parties, but also that the process and procedure adopted for the deregistration of the 74 political parties was in compliance with extant laws.\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement yesterday, INEC was faced with multiple cases by the deregistered political parties, with the courts giving conflicting judgements.\n\nIn one of such cases by some of the 74 deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja, had in a judgment delivered on July 29, 2020, affirmed the powers of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nThe appellate court in a unanimous decision presented by Justice Mohammed Idris, held that INEC acted within the constitutional provisions, as well as the Electoral Act in sacking the political parties, which failed to win a single office in the last general election.\n\nConsequently, the Court of Appeal nullified and set aside the judgment of Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier nullified INEC\u2019s deregistration of the political parties on the grounds that the deregistration breached Section 225(a) of the Constitution. The affected parties headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe said constitutional provision -Section 225(a) \u2013 spells out the minimum election victory a party must record or percentage of votes it must poll to sustain its status as a registered political party.\n\nIn another case by some other deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, ordered the commission to re-list 22 of the political parties deregistered for failing to win any elective office in the 2019 general election.\n\nThe court made the order shortly after setting aside a judgment of the Federal High Court, which upheld the power of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nJustice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, in a judgment delivered on June 11, 2020 had dismissed the suit of the 22 appellants challenging the power of INEC to deregister them.\n\nReacting to yesterday\u2019s ruling, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council, Dr. Leonard Nzenwa hailed the judgment, saying it had ended all speculations and that \u201cthis will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomole, has described the call for military takeover of a democratically elected government as irresponsible and senseless.\n\nOshiomhole\u2019s reaction followed a recent call by legal luminary, Chief Roberts Clarke, in an interview on television, for military intervention in governance in order to fix the country\u2019s festering security challenges and to carry out restructuring of the country.\n\nThe former national Chairman of APC spoke yesterday in Abuja when the leadership of the Law Students Association of Nigeria (LAWSON), paid him a courtesy visit, during which they invited him to their forthcoming National Conference on Rule of Law.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI watched on a national television one of your very senior colleagues, Chief Robert Clarke, I was shocked when I saw him calling on the President to handover to the military.\n\n\u201cI thought that was the height of irresponsibility, given his knowledge, given his age and a very senior member of the bar and, what is it that he wanted? He wants a military that will restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is again for me senseless, because the structure as it is today, who put it in place? Who overthrew the parliamentary system?\u201d\n\nThe former Edo State Governor was of the opinion that the first thing that suffers under the military is the rule of law, adding that for anyone who is familiar with the military system, like Clarke, should tender apology to Nigerians.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe parliamentary system was overthrown by the Nigerian military. That is on record. Who created 12 states from the four regions by decree? It was the military. The current 36 states and FCT; who created them by military decree? It was the military. How can anybody who has lived through and who is familiar with our journey as a nation think that the solution to our problems as a nation is to handover to the military? I think, talking about the rule of law, that is treason.\n\n\u201cYou know we have freedom of speech but it does not include the freedom to canvass unlawful means to effect a change. When you canvas unlawful means, then you should be arraigned before a court of law and dealt with according to the law. Ignorance is not even an excuse in law, not to talk of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOshiomhole called on Nigerians to have faith in the country in spite of the challenges, while urging everyone not to give up.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that even in our moment of distress and regardless of what anybody thinks, the world has resolved and Nigeria is part of it, that never again shall we be governed by an unelected government, never, we don\u2019t want unelected Angels.\u201d\n\nOn the agitation for separation, the APC chieftain described those agitating for secession as \u201cpoor students of history\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am also not agreeing with those who think of dis-membering Nigeria. They say let everybody go his way. Nigeria is not a reality. Those ones are poor students of history.\n\n\u201cWhy is Europe spending so much time forming the European Union to create a larger market? Recently, we signed the African Trade Agreement so that Nigeria can access a bigger market. We already have a local market of 200 million. If we can keep it flourishing and increase the purchasing power of the citizens, we already have a huge market. That should be an asset.

          "text": "\u2022Raised red flags snubbed by US bank\u2019s management\n\nFestus Akanbi and Emmanuel Addeh, with agency report\n\nFresh documents on the long-standing legal dispute between the federal government and Malabu Oil have shown that JP Morgan, the American bank in the middle of the alleged scandal, was alerted by its internal control team that the $875 million transfers to former petroleum minister Dan Etete, for the sale of OPL 245, were questionable.\n\nEtete, who was minister under the Sani Abacha regime, has been in the eye of the storm concerning the sale of the oil block which triggered a number of court cases in Nigeria and in Europe.\n\nA report yesterday by Bloomberg indicated that JPMorgan Chase & Co. was warned by its compliance team over the \u201cgreat risk\u201d of corruption just days before it made the last of three transfers that totalled $875 million to Etete.\n\nThe federal government, in a London lawsuit, is pushing that the internal memo sent by the compliance unit to the bank\u2019s managers should be scrutinised.\n\nThe U.S. bank is accused of ignoring the red flags when it transferred funds between 2011 and 2013 to Dan Etete, whose private jet was seized by the Buhari government.\n\nThe memo disclosed at a London court hearing last Wednesday showed what JPMorgan managers knew about the oil contract and when, lawyers for the Nigerian government said in court documents. A spokesperson for the investment bank declined to comment.\n\nAccording to court documents, by 2013, JPMorgan\u2019s internal concerns over payments to Malabu Oil and Gas were escalated to more senior members of the bank.\n\n\u201cIn light of Malabu\u2019s reported connection to the alleged Nigerian corruption scheme, there would be great risk presented if JPMC continues to process wires involving Malabu,\u201d a compliance officer based in the United States wrote in a memo dated Aug. 23, 2013 and quoted by Bloomberg.\n\nJust six days later, JPMorgan made a payment of $75.2 million to the Malabu account, according to the report.\n\nLawyers for the federal government said in court last Wednesday that they wanted to know how the memo was compiled and asked a judge for more emails and documents from the compliance team.\n\nThe lawyers are seeking details of how the US bank\u2019s compliance team monitored and placed controls over questionable payments including a so-called \u201cinterdiction list\u201d, a tool to prevent transfers from being automatically cleared. Malabu was placed on the list in November 2013.\n\nThe federal government had alleged that most of the $1.3 billion purchase price for the licence for the offshore oilfield known as OPL 245 was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen under previous administrations.\n\nIn 1998, the government awarded OPL 245 for $20 million to Malabu Oil and Gas, which was later found to be owned by Dan Etete, who was oil minister at the time, in collaboration with people close to former military ruler, Sani Abacha.\n\nThree years later, in July 2001, the then government under President Olusegun Obasanjo revoked OPL 245 licence, triggering legal disputes over its ownership that dragged on for years.\n\nBy 2006, Malabu reached a settlement with the federal government, agreeing to pay $218 million to Nigeria in return for the licence being fully reinstated, after it was given to Shell, which subsequently failed to pay.\n\nThe case became even more complex when Mohammed Abacha, son of the former ruler, launched a legal challenge arguing that Etete pushed him out of his partial ownership of Malabu.\n\nIn 2011, Malabu agreed to hand OPL 245 back to the government for $1.092 billion. In parallel, Shell and Eni agreed to pay the government $1.092 billion plus a signature bonus of $208 million, taking their payment for OPL 245 to $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the same year, $1.092 billion was placed in an escrow account opened by the Nigerian government with U.S. bank JP Morgan, from which $875 million was transferred to bank accounts in the name of Malabu.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria filed a case at a London High Court against the bank alleging negligence for its role in transferring the $875 million to Etete\u2019s Malabu, an allegation JP Morgan said it considered \u201cunsubstantiated and without merit\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, a Nigerian judge issued arrest warrants for Dan Etete, and an Eni manager over the sale of the oilfield.\n\nEuropean and Nigerian courts have been raking over the purchase by Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc of the oil license in Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, a decade ago.\n\nWhile the energy giants were recently acquitted of corruption charges in Milan, in a decision prosecutors could appeal, Nigeria\u2019s government is continuing to seek compensation from JPMorgan.\n\nThe Buhari administration claims Etete distributed a portion of the funds received via the bank from the oil majors to corrupt former and serving senior public officials.\n\nThe bank has denied any wrongdoing and says it is being held responsible for not protecting the Nigerian people from their own government.\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s oil minister in the last weeks of the corrupt Abacha military regime in 1998, Etete was said to have effectively awarded the prospecting rights of the huge OPL 245 block to the company he secretly controlled.\n\nAfter Abacha\u2019s sudden death, Etete retained the rights as a private citizen until he offloaded them to oil giants Shell and Eni in 2011, and they paid a combined $1.3 billion to the federal government.\n\nThe entire OPL245 deal was a subject of a corruption trial in Italy, where Etete was an accused, together with alleged middlemen, Eni and Shell, and several of their executives. The court recently acquitted the international oil executives.\n\nThe Nigerian authorities had also charged Etete and several others linked to Malabu with money laundering in connection with the onward flow of funds from the OPL245 deal.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the allegations as \u201cpolitical propaganda.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Uganda wants to replace its social media tax with a 12% tax on internet bundles",
          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

          "text": "Paystack, a fintech company that powers growth and payments for businesses in Africa, today announced its official launch in South Africa after a six-month pilot. The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust. And there is no better source in Nigeria (today) like Meat247 powered by Livestock247.com",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

We have been in touch with the police headquarters and agreed that Edo State Government will intervene in upgrading and improving the training facility and make it available for training the policemen and other members of the security architecture in the State.\n\n\u201cWe are redesigning the security architecture for the state and it will enable us to have a permanent training facility for about five or six squads at a time, made up of fifty men in each squad.\n\n\u201cThey will be equipped with introductory training in security, intermediate and advanced training as well in different levels. It can\u2019t happen with the facility in a state of disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come in to do an evaluation and assessment ourselves. The clinic needs to be rehabilitated and re-equipped and the hostels need to be rebuilt and re-equipped for decent habitation. The classroom needs to be rebuilt and the training ground and the obstacles need to be upgraded and repaired,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor further noted that \u201cthe state government is concerned about the state of the security system and cannot leave it for the Federal Government alone. Security is everybody\u2019s concern and as a state government, we have decided to put our money where our mouth is and use what we have to try and solve our problem\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Police Commissioner said that \u201cas a Force, we are happy that this facility is going to be upgraded by the Edo State Government.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state. I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nInternational ratings agency, Fitch, has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) and its primary operating subsidiary, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd (FBN), at \u2018B-\u2018 with a Negative Outlook, after the change of the bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe affirmation, Fitch said in an article on Friday, reflects is view that the impact of the CBN replacement of FBNH and FBN\u2019s boards, the identification of corporate governance failings and the imposition of corrective measures are tolerable at the rating level.\n\n\u201cWe have assessed the near-term financial impact of these actions on FBNH and FBN and believe this is tolerable at the rating level, even though the final outcome is uncertain. In our view, any remedial actions imposed by the CBN, including a potential reclassification of related-party exposures as impaired, will not have a material effect on the group\u2019s asset quality, profitability and capitalisation,\u201d Fitch said in the article published on its website.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not consider any possible additional actions by the CBN, especially if FBN fails to implement the regulator\u2019s corrective measures or if there were any further uncovering of corporate governance irregularities.\u201d\n\nFitch said, the Outlook remains Negative, reflecting FBNH\u2019s pre-existing asset quality and capitalisation weaknesses as well as the group\u2019s corporate governance weaknesses highlighted by the CBN. These could put pressure on the ratings.\n\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nAccording to Fitch, FBNH is the non-operating holding company that owns FBN. FBNH\u2019s ratings are aligned with those of FBN (which represents around 90% of consolidated group assets) due to high capital and liquidity fungibility within the group, and low double leverage (at 95% at end-1H20) at the holding company level.\n\nFBNH\u2019s IDR is driven by its intrinsic creditworthiness, as defined by its \u2018b-\u2018 Viability Rating (VR). The rating considers the group\u2019s exposure to Nigeria\u2019s volatile operating environment and also factors in vulnerability in its capital position in the context of moderate earnings generation and asset-quality pressures, where headroom above the minimum regulatory capital requirements is also moderate. Capitalisation is a factor of high importance to the VR.\n\nThe new boards appointed to FBNH and FBN comprise individuals with sufficient experience and expertise. However, we view such major change as hugely disruptive. There are no changes in FBNH and FBN\u2019s executive management team.\n\nWe believe the governance shortcomings cited by the CBN reflect poorly on FBNH\u2019s reputation and on the group\u2019s governance and control practices. As a result, we have revised down our assessment of FBNH\u2019s Management and Strategy score to \u2018b-\u2018 from \u2018b\u2019.\n\nWe also assigned a negative outlook to this factor, which reflects the uncertainty surrounding additional remedial actions that the CBN may impose due to these related party exposures as well as the potential for further uncovering of governance irregularities. It also captures the lack of track record of the new board and its ability to restore confidence in FBNH and FBN.\n\nAsset quality remains a rating weakness. FBNH reported an improved impaired loan ratio of 7.9% at end-1Q21 (end-2020: 7.7%). However, FBNH\u2019s reported reserve coverage of 54.5% at end-1Q21 (end-2020: 48%) remains significantly weaker than domestic peers\u2019. Our assessment indicates that if the related-party loan highlighted by the CBN were classified as impaired, the ratio would be unlikely to be above 10% (excluding any new impaired loan generation from ordinary business).\n\nCapitalisation remains a rating weakness and has a high influence on the ratings. FBN reported a capital adequacy ratio of 16.6% at end-1Q21 (excluding interim profits), which provides limited headroom above its 15% minimum regulatory requirement. In addition, FBNH\u2019s capitalisation metrics remain vulnerable to asset-quality risks given significant capital encumbrance by unreserved impaired loans.\n\nFBNH\u2019s profitability metrics typically lag behind those of the other large banks, mainly due to high loan impairment charges. In our view, the corrective measures, including higher provisioning on related-party loans or the sale of \u2018non-permissible\u2019 equity investments, would not materially affect profitability in the near term.\n\nOur conversations with FBNH give us to understand there has been no adverse effect from recent events on its funding and liquidity profile, which remains healthy. FBNH\u2019s funding profile continues to benefit from a substantial customer deposit base, which provides around 75% of its non-equity funding.\n\nSENIOR DEBT\n\nFBN\u2019s senior debt issued by FBN Finance Company BV is rated in line with the bank\u2019s Long-Term IDR, as the notes ultimately represent unconditional, senior unsecured obligations of the bank, which rank pari passu with its other senior unsecured obligations.\n\nUnless otherwise stated above, the key drivers of FBNH\u2019s other ratings and the ratings of its subsidiaries are in line with our most recent Rating Action Commentary (See \u201cFitch Affirms FBN Holdings Plc at \u2018B-\u2018; off RWN; Outlook Negative\u201d published on 5 October 2020).\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\nThe ratings of FBNH would be downgraded if the corporate governance shortcomings highlighted by the CBN persist and if any further weaknesses are uncovered, potentially leading to a greater financial impact.\n\nReputational repercussions that would make it harder for FBNH to meet its pre-tax profit growth ambitions, or significant adjustments to the group\u2019s management and strategy, could also contribute to rating pressure.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\nUpside to the ratings is unlikely at present.\n\nBEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from \u2018AAA\u2019 to \u2018D\u2019. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom on Saturday described Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna as a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him.\n\nOrtom added that the Kaduna governor was one of the \u201cvery few persons\u201d who misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOrtom stated this while reacting to the statement credited to El-Rufai, where the latter reportedly accused the Benue Governor of attacking the federal government to cover for his failure to secure Benue state.\n\nHowever, a statement signed by Ortom\u2019s spokesman, Terver Akase, said El-Rufai made such a comment to get back into the good books of the president.\n\nThe statement added that El-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to make such a comment owing to the insecurity and other challenges in Kaduna.\n\nPlease read Ortom\u2019s full statement on El-Rufai below:\n\nEL-RUFAI IS ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE MISLED PRESIDENT BUHARI\n\nWe read the statement credited to Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai in which he accused Governor Samuel Ortom of using the insecurity in his state to attack the Federal Government in order to cover up what he termed as the Benue State Governor\u2019s failure.\n\nWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\nA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launchpad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to the limelight.\n\nNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\nIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\n\nEl-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\nKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less that 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\nTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\nNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari. El-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\n\nNasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a Governor who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015?\n\nThe Kaduna Governor should know that only two days ago, the people of Benue State met at a stakeholders meeting in Makurdi and unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Ortom in recognition of his performance. That meeting was attended across party lines with leaders of All Progressives Congress, APC also present.",

          "text": "A night of heavy clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound and elsewhere in Jerusalem left more than 200 Palestinians wounded, as the city braced for even more violence after weeks of unrest.\n\nNightly protests broke out at the start of the holy month of Ramadan over police restrictions at a popular gathering place and have reignited in recent days over threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinians from their homes in east Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides in the decades-old conflict.\n\nIt was unclear what set off the violence at Al-Aqsa, which erupted when Israeli police in riot gear deployed in large numbers as thousands of Muslim worshippers were holding evening prayers at the sprawling hilltop esplanade.\n\nThroughout the night large groups of protesters could be seen hurling rocks as Israeli police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades. At one point, the police entered one of the buildings in the complex, which includes the Al-Aqsa mosque and the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said 88 of the wounded were hospitalised. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 83 people were wounded by rubber-coated bullets, including three who were shot in the eye, two with serious head injuries and two with broken jaws.\n\nThe Israeli police said protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at them, wounding 17 officers, half of whom were hospitalized.\n\n\u201cWe will respond with a heavy hand to all violent disturbances, riots and attacks on our forces,\u201d it said in a statement late Friday.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam. It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the biblical temples. It has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was the epicenter of the 2000 Palestinian intifada, or uprising.\n\nSome 70,000 worshippers had attended the final midday Friday prayers of Ramadan at Al-Aqsa, the Islamic endowment that oversees the site said. Thousands protested afterwards, waving the green flags of the Islamic militant group Hamas and chanting pro-Hamas slogans.\n\nAt the beginning of Ramadan in mid-April, Israel blocked off a popular gathering spot where Palestinians traditionally socialize at the end of their daylong fast. The move set off two weeks of clashes before Israel lifted the restrictions.\n\nBut in recent days, protests have grown over Israel\u2019s threatened eviction in Sheikh Jarrah in east Jerusalem of dozens of Palestinians embroiled in a long legal battle with Israeli settlers trying to acquire property in the neighborhood.\n\nEgypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, condemned its actions, as did the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, which was one of four Arab countries that signed U.S.-brokered normalization agreements with Israel last year.\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians are bracing for more unrest in the coming days.",

          "text": "A blast close to a secondary school in the Afghan capital Kabul has left at least 30 people dead and dozens more injured, officials have said.\n\nThe bombing, apparently aimed to cause maximum civilian carnage, adds to fears that violence in the war-wrecked country could escalate as the US and NATO end nearly 20 years of military engagement.\n\nWhile no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, the Afghan Islamic State affiliate has targeted the Shiite neighborhood before.\n\nThe radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan\u2019s minority Shiite Muslims. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nIn Dasht-e-Barchi, angry crowds attacked the ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.\n\nImages circulating on social media purportedly showed bloodied school backpacks and books strewn across the street in front if the school, and smoke rising above the neighborhood.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters in a message that only the Islamic State group could be responsible for such a heinous crime. Mujahid also accused Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence agency of being complicit with IS, although he offered no evidence.\n\nThe Taliban and the Afghan government have traded accusations over a series of targeted killings of civil society workers, journalists and Afghan professionals. While IS has taken responsibility for some of those killings, many have gone unclaimed.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a statement condemning the attack, blaming the Taliban even as they denied it. He offered no proof.\n\nIS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.\n\nThe attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.",
