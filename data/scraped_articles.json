          "text": "The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, has warned the management of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria to stop building estates for the super rich with funds deducted from poor workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nWabba stated this on Wednesday at a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of an estate on an expanse of land acquired in Karshi, Nasarawa State, by the Public Complaints Commission branch of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria.\n\nWabba warned the FMBN to avoid a situation whereby poor homeless workers would be forced to park in to expensive houses it was building for rich men in highbrow areas, many of which he added, remained unoccupied.\n\nThe NLC boss said, \u201cThere are so many houses in Abuja today that are unoccupied.\n\n\u201cThese are houses that were built with workers money, deducted from their meagre salaries, and yet the workers cannot afford them.\n\n\u201cWe have told them that a time will come when they won\u2019t need to invite people to occupy those houses because poverty will soon push us to park our loads into any empty house we see, built with deductions from our salaries.\n\n\u201cThere is an estate built by the FMBN along the Abuja-Kaduna Road which they could not sell because they are expensive, people went there and occupied the buildings. We are getting there gradually.\n\n\u201cWhen you go round the city, just look for buildings built with workers money that are left unoccupied.\n\n\u201d Yes, we are getting to that point when 90 per cent of the people would be below the poverty line and the FMBN is building for the super rich who are just 10 per cent. Housing schemes must be for the 90 per cent.\n\n\u201cGovernments in the past were building houses for workers and would later sell the apartments to them at affordable prices.\n\n\u201cThat is the type of system that we want now. We should practice a system that takes care of everyone including the vulnerable.\n\n\u201cAlthough government said it is doing something about it but we believe whatever they are doing is not enough.\n\n\u201cWe have enormous resources in this country that could take care of the need of everybody.\n\n\u201cOne of the necessities of life is accommodation. It is so important because every worker wants to be a tenant but a home owner.\n\n\u201cOne thing that consumes the income of a worker is rent. If you save your rent for 35 years, it can build a house for you.\u201d\n\nHe, however said that the NLC was partnering with the FMBN to build affordable houses in all states of the federation so that workers could have roofs upon their heads.\n\nHe said, \u201cBecause we are stakeholders. We are social partners with the FMBN, I have set up a committee who are meeting with the Managing Director of the FMBN and his other officials to try to look at how workers could benefit from what they are contributing.\n\n\u201cThe money does not belong to the FMBN. It belongs to the workers because the funds are deducted from their salaries,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Chief Commissioner, Public Complaints Commission, Chille Igbawua, and top officials of PASAN said the Karshi estate project will help cushion the effect of accommodation problems of the PCC staff.",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dennis Agbo\n\nFollowing the altercations between Enugu Catholic priest, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka, and the Federal government, Vanguard was informed that Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, invited Fr. Mbaka to the Bishop\u2019s court which he honoured on Tuesday.\n\nMbaka reportedly hinted his faithful about the invitation and when he got to the Bishop\u2019s court at about midday on Tuesday, he called his sides that he had gotten there, and ever since then his phones went off.\n\nWorries went around the Catholic circle about Fr Mbaka who did not return to his adoration parish in Emene and nothing was heard from him.\n\nHis driver was said to have slept at Bishop\u2019s gate since his principal did not come out again to ride back to Emene.\n\nWhen Vanguard on Tuesday inquired from the Diocesan spokesman, Rev Fr Ben Achi, on what the Diocese was doing to tame Mbaka\u2019s vituperations and political altercations, Achi said \u201cWell, the Church has her procedure in dealing with issues like this.\n\n\u201cNo one tells the Church what to do in matters like this. It falls within the competence of the ecclesiastical authorities and trust me, the issue is being addressed.\u201d\n\nIt was further learnt that Bishop Onaga invited Fr. Mbaka on Tuesday so as to dissuade him from making further remarks on his faceoff with the federal government on Wednesday when he usually holds special prayers on the adoration ground.\n\nIt was suspected that Bishop Onaga could have tactically withheld Mbaka from going back on Tuesday so as to truncate the Wednesday prayer where Mbaka was expected to have further engaged the federal government on their altercations.\n\nThe Adoration faithful gathered on Wednesday only to discover that Fr Mbaka was nowhere to be found and they took to protest, asking Bishop Onaga to produce their spiritual Director.\n\nThe fanatical faithful carried placards and chanted songs such as \u201cNo Mbaka, No Bishop\u201d, \u201d Bishop Produce Mbaka within 24 hours\u201d, among other inscriptions.\n\nThe protesters vandalized the Bishop\u2019s Court and proceeded to Holy Ghost Cathedral where further destructions took place.\n\nProbably envisaging that the protest was getting out of hand, Fr. Mbaka suddenly appeared among the protesting crowd as he was spotted along Igboeze street, close to the Bishop\u2019s court in Independence layout of the coal City.\n\nIn a motorcade, Mbaka rode with his faithful along Enugu streets back to the Adoration ground in Emene where he promised to address the faithful and the press on his travail.\n\nThe procession to the Adoration ground took over three hours. Mbaka was yet to get to the Adoration ground as at 6:25 pm when he left Independence layout by 2:50 pm in a distance of about eight kilometres.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026High cost of governance fueled by graft, waste and incompetence \u2013 Owasanoye\n\nBy Soni Daniel, Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed, has requested the assistance of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to help in reducing the high cost of governance in the public sector.\n\nShe said this at a Policy Dialogue on Corruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria organised by the Anti-Corruption Academy of Nigeria (ACAN) the training and research arm of ICPC at the Commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nAhmed, in her address, revealed that the need for the reduction of cost of governance was in compliance with the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari, to review government payroll.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cWhile working to increase revenue, we will work to reduce the high cost of governance and I am glad that ICPC is taking this initiative as its natural mandate is to prevent corruption\u201d.\n\nThe Minister stressed that while it was important to enforce the laws prohibiting corruption, the second most important thing was to prevent corruption from happening.\n\nShe revealed that her ministry had designed a strategic revenue initiative which was aimed at solving the problem of revenue deficiency by expanding revenue sources, and also reducing cost by alternating processes that give room for corruption such as IPPIS, GIFMIS.\n\nShe also stated that a transparency portal had been launched to provide access to citizens to view transactions from agencies and monitor how government was performing its transactions.\n\nAhmed said she will work with relevant agencies of government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures so that limited resources can be used for important projects.\n\nIn his opening address, ICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, said that the high cost of governance was fueled partially by corruption, incompetence and waste in governance structure and processes of the nation.\n\nHe highlighted some areas of concern that are undergoing investigation and the scrutiny of the Commission to include diversion of savings from budgetary allocations to things like COVID-19 palliatives without authorization, payroll padding and the phenomenon of ghost workers, as well as project duplication.\n\nThe ICPC boss urged citizens to become watchdogs of projects in their communities noting that ICPC was working with the Budget Office to track funding of such projects.\n\nHe further explained that \u201cpolicy dialogues of this nature were meant to deliberate on issues that focus on more systemic and institutional improvements, which also should be sustainable regardless of changes in political administration\u201d.\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, who was represented by Permanent Secretary David Adejo, said that the federal government was determined to reduce cost of governance through the harmonization of MDAs.\n\nThe SGF who declared the event open, added that government had adopted measures such as IPPIS, GIFMIS to ensure that cost of governance does not increase to the detriment of the people.\n\nIn his goodwill message, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan who spoke through the Chairman Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption, Senator Suleiman Abdu Kwari decried the increase in corruption despite concerted efforts being made to stem it.\n\nHe said more needed to be done which required critical and systemic thinking to arrest the situation.\n\nHe commended the untiring effort of ICPC in the pursuit of its mandate while pledging the continued support of the legislature to the Commission to ensure achievement of her mandate.\n\nOn her part, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HOCSF), Mrs. Folasade Yemi-Esan, who was represented by Mr. D. O. Omogo said they were committed to the efforts of government to reduce cost at all levels.\n\nShe said that HOCSF appraised the conditions of service of all government agencies to be in line with all extant rules thereby giving them a significant role to play in reducing cost of governance.\n\nMrs. Yemi-Esan also revealed that the Office of the HOCSF had in place Performance Management System and Electronic Content Management to ensure that all activities were captured electronically.\n\nIn his keynote, the Director-General, Budget Office of the Federation, Ben Akabueze, observed that yearly budget performance report at all levels of government showed a higher recurrent expenditure which called for a cut down especially as sources of revenue has waned.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nMr. Akabueze proffered some solutions to the issue of high cost of governance such as amendment of the Constitution to restructure the federation into six regions instead of 36 states; reduction of federal ministries from 27 to 20; and staff salaries to be consolidated and harmonized.\n\nThe moderator of the session, Prof. Uche Uwaleke suggested that the whistle-blower policy should be strengthened, and protection of informants be treated seriously.\n\nHe also said the Efficiency Unit which worked with the private sector should also be strengthened and given legal backing.\n\nSenior Research fellow, ACAN, Prof. Isaac N. Obasi while presenting highlights of draft policy considerations on corruption and cost of governance recommended a drastic reduction of high overhead expenditure in order to curtail the prevailing high fiscal deficit; review of the cost intensive aspects of Nigeria\u2019s presidential system of government without losing the quality of checks and balances and proportional representation.\n\nHe also recommended that the federal government lead by example by urgently introducing new cost-cutting measures that would put on hold the proliferation of institutions on a competitive geo-political basis.\n\nThe Acting Provost of ACAN, Prof. Tunde Babawale said that the country would make significant progress if the wasteful practices of public officials such as duplication of functions of MDAs, embezzlement of public funds, kickbacks from contracts, procurement fraud, diversion of public funds into private hands can be curbed.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Anayo Okoli, Dennis Agbo & Chinedu Adonu \u2013 Enugu\n\nThe sudden resurface of Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka, the Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministry, in Enugu, after his whereabouts was not known for over 24 hours saved what would have been a major crisis in Enugu.\n\nMbaka was said to have been seen last on Tuesday morning when he left his Adoration arena to answer an invitation by the Catholic Bishop of Enugu, Callistus Onaga, at the Bishop\u2019s Court.\n\nIt is not clear if security operatives used the bishop to invite him for questioning over his recent altercations with the Presidency following his call that President Muhammadu Buhari has failed the nation and should resign or be impeached.\n\nThe Presidency, through Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media, launched an attack on him, accusing him of being angry because the President refused to give him contract, an allegation Mbaka has also denied.\n\nThe confusion over his whereabouts after almost 48 hours prompted the Adoration family to protest to the Bishop to demand the whereabouts of their spiritual father.\n\nThey accused the Bishop of inviting Mbaka and handed him over to the Federal Government to destroy him.\n\nWhen the Bishop was nowhere to address them and nobody was delegated to address them at the Bishop\u2019s Court where hundreds of them had gathered, they became violent, destroying windows and doors\u2019 glasses.\n\nNot satisfied, the protesters decided to move to Holy Ghost the Headquarters of the Catholic Church in Enugu. As the news of Mbaka\u2019s unknown whereabouts spread, tension began to build in all parts of Enugu metropolis.\n\nTricycle riders in their numbers with fresh leaves hoisted on their tricycles as a sign of solidarity joined and led the way to the Holy Ghost.\n\nHowever, as they were making their way to the place news filtered in that Mbaka has come out. The news was received with jubilations as the crowd went into frenzy and they decided to make their way back to the Adoration ground where they are still waiting for him as at the time of filing the report.\n\nMbaka said he was not deterred but rather happy that the truth is \u201cheating the Presidency hard\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the three people referred to as contractors by the Presidency were people that came to help the country fight insecurity in the country during the first tenure of President Buhari, pointing out that \u201cthey had the gadgets and facilities to lift Nigeria out of security challenges\u201d.\n\nHe maintained his position that \u201cas directed by the Holy Spirit\u201d, insisting that \u201cBuhari cannot do it again; he should resign or be impeached\u201d, adding that \u201cage and health are not on his side anymore\u201d.\n\n\u201cFallacy cannot terrorize my courage. We are working under the law. They have never given me any contract but I want to reassure you even if 100 oil blocks are offered to me that cannot bastardize my prophetic anointing.\n\n\u201cWith enormous joy, I am happy that the truth is heating them hard. No amount of money can merchandise the Holy Ghost anointing in me. Father Mbaka is un-bribable. Even if they come and build the highest university here, that cannot bribe me.\n\n\u201cWhen the Holy Spirit asked me to speak, I will speak out. So the statement is let them provide a job for you. Let them leave my people; they should not allow hunger to kill people, let them give you something to eat. Let them make our education qualitative.\n\n\u201cHealthy medical facilities; no longer for the rich going outside the country to treat themselves and the poor perish here; never again.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Spirit is still saying what he said; if you are in a football match no matter how good the player is and has injury and can\u2019t play well anymore, he will pack himself out of the field.\n\n\u201cThe opponent is laughing and the international community is watching us. The country was named 3rd worst country on Wednesday last week.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid of them. Buhari cannot do it again; health and age are not on his side. We need a stronger and experienced goal keeper in a time like this.\n\n\u201cIf they want to put it that it was because of a contract, let them come and build the highest university here and begin to mess up, I will still speak. I am speaking under the influence of the Holy Spirit. I am not in any political party and not supporting anybody.\n\n\u201cI am not supporting any terrorist group, rather will I allow you to brand my people terrorists because they are not terrorists. It is very simple because like I said those who are carrying cattle and riffles killing people are they called terrorists?\n\n\u201cHow can IPOB people who are walking about without a machete or stick called terrorists. Maybe they are not well informed. They are hungry people; you have to provide a job for them. Engage them and see if they can complain again.\n\n\u201cThese are the three men that came in to handle insecurity for the country. And they have the gadgets and facilities and that was during the first administration.\n\n\u201cAnd they said that they will help them in containing insecurity, to help the country stop insecurity less than one month. And I handed them over to the federal government.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know them but they came to Enugu and pleaded for me to link them to the government.\n\n\u201cDue to the level of insecurity and how Nigeria has been moving their oil to outside the country, they said they have all the apparatus to revive the oil and recruit all youths in the industry and the issue of insecurity and killing will die.\n\n\u201cThese are the three people they rejected their offer. What will I gain from the people that came in for the purpose of securing the country? I don\u2019t even have their contact\u201d, he said.\n\nHe urged the Presidency and Garba Shehu to \u201cchallenge the truth not the messenger\u201d, even as he dismissed Garba Shehu\u2019s accusation as \u201cchildish and laughable\u201d.\n\nMbaka warned that \u201che would be the last person this administration would attack because the wrath of God would befall them if they tried it again\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou allowed the truth to be hidden; then you started attacking the person who said the truth. You don\u2019t attack the messenger, challenge the truth whether there is insecurity or not, whether there are good hospitals in this country or not.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? While God has loved us and saved us from the coronavirus and some of our leaders are becoming the coronavirus that we are suffering.\n\n\u201cWhat are we talking about? Is there employment opportunity for the youths as it should be? The money they are parking for the 2023 election, if they use it and build industries and recruit our youths there will be work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that because it (allegation) is a laughable and childish accusation. Whoever is saying that is a shame to himself and shame to the people he is representing. Fr. Mbaka\u2019s voice came from the spiritual, so what I\u2019m saying is unchallengeable. Why I have been silent and waiting for them to change until God says speak.\n\n\u201cThere are some messages that can be as dull, some are like rain but some are like thunder, anybody knows that challenging such a message is challenging God of thunder and should be careful.\n\n\u201cThe Fr Mbaka who was speaking is not just a Priest but by the special grace of God, the father, son and Holy Spirit under the Holy Ghost anointing. He is the job provider, yes to the glory of God those that are benefiting from me every month, direct salary earners are not less than 23,000 people.\n\nALSO READ: Bandits release 27 Afaka Forestry College Students\n\n\u201cSo if I have been paying salary to no less than 23,000 direct workers every month; direct workers not indirect. My packers and loaders, I pay them every two weeks. I thank Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State for giving us an enabling environment\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe three men they talked about, I am not here to defend anybody to stupid allegations but thank God for using that man to tell the whole world that Buhari have not given me any money.\n\n\u201cYou see his God works. Shehu, thank you, for telling everybody that you have not given me any contract.\n\n\u201cIf they are angry that I am blessing Nnamdi Kanu, wherever he is, is God not blessing him? He is breathing and healthy. Is it not the blessing from God? Or is he not my brother and spiritually is he not my son?\n\n\u201cWhat is their problem? They are busy branding people and communities terrorists, if what is happening in Kano, Kaduna, Nassarawa, Maiduguri, Benue, Niger and all the states are branded terrorists, is the whole Nigeria not being branded terrorist? They should be careful with the choice of words and be wise. Shame to them; I do my charity without their support\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity I am talking about can affect them also. They can kill Shehu. There is no level of security used in securing the House of Assembly and Government House that can secure them better than giving jobs to unemployed youths.\n\n\u201cHow is it that the whole Nigeria can\u2019t afford a befitting hospital that when the President is sick, he will be flown abroad for treatment? Shame on them!\n\n\u201cThe last person this administration should fight is Fr, Mbaka. If they speak against me again, the anger of heaven will fall on them and the end will shock everybody because I represent the poor, the less privilege, unemployed, sick de-humanized, the downtrodden in this country; I am their father, so when my children are crying, I can\u2019t be silent.\n\n\u201cI have not been silent in speaking against evil governance. If this country is better, our children outside the country will start running back. We have all that it takes to make the country better\u201d, he said in the long sermon.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has inaugurated a steering committee on prevention of gender-based violence in the state.\n\nInaugurating the committee, Gov. Ugwuanyi, represented by his deputy, Hon. Mrs. Cecilia Ezeilo, stated that the body is saddled with the sacred mandate of developing and implementing programmes and policies for the prevention of gender-based violence in Enugu State, as well as \u201cthe rehabilitation of persons who still fall victim of gender-based violence despite all the preventive measures\u201d.\n\nIt would be recalled that the wife of the Enugu State Governor, Mrs. Monica Ugochi Ugwuanyi, had recently campaigned against gender-based violence, calling for an all-inclusive and sustained crusade to stem the tide of domestic violence, sexual abuse, female genital mutilation, public harassment, among other forms of violence against women in the society.\n\nMrs. Ugwuanyi lamented that the violent behaviour has eaten deep into the fabric of the society, adding that it cuts across most human societies, irrespective of gender.\n\nSpeaking further, during the committee\u2019s inauguration, Mrs. Ezeilo pointed out that \u201cthe committee must work very hard in order to consign gender-based violence to the dustbins of history in our state, pursuant to the operational policy thrust of the State Tamar Sexual Assault Referral Centre (TARMASAC), the strategy of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the goals of the Child Rights Act and the Universal Sustainable Development Goals No.5\u201d.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference are also to \u201cconduct public awareness campaigns on reporting cases of gender-based violence; provide for the rehabilitation and promotion of the welfare of victims, and develop a gender-based violence prevention sustainable plan for the state through synergy between the private and public sectors\u201d.\n\nThe deputy governor, who harped on the enormous soft spot Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration has for vulnerable groups, such as women, girls and children, expressed optimism that the committee \u201cwill give a fresh and very impactful impetus to this clear government mantra towards the protection and preservation of the human dignity of everyone regardless of gender, status or age\u201d.\n\nMembers of the committee include the Commissioner for Gender Affairs and Social Development, Rt. Hon. Princess Peace Nnaji, who serves as Chairman; the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Miletus Eze; Commissioner for Education, Prof. Uche Eze; Commissioner for Information, Nnanyelugo Chidi Aroh; their Health counterpart, Dr. Emmanuel Ikechukwu Obi; Commissioner of Police, Enugu State Command; State Commander, NAPTIP; State Commandant, NSCDC, and Zonal Coordinator, National Human Rights Commission, Enugu.\n\nOthers include the Presidents of Catholic Women Organization, Anglican Women Fellowship and Methodist Women Organization; Chairman, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Enugu State; Chairman, Enugu State Traditional Rulers\u2019 Council, HRH Igwe Amb.

Peter Eje of Ogbodu-Aba Community; President, African Network for the Prevention and Protection of Child Abuse and Neglect, Nigeria Chapter, Prof. Emeritus Peter Ebigbo, and the Executive Director, Global Health Awareness and Research Foundation, Enugu, Prof. Emeritus Obioma Nwoargo.\n\nAlso in the list are, the Executive Director, Women Aid Collective, Prof. Joy Ezeilo; Executive Director, Society for Improvement of Rural People; Coordinator, CIRRDOC; Zonal Director, Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, Enugu; Managing Director, Enugu State Broadcasting Service; Zonal Director, NTA Enugu; Executive Director, Heroine Women Foundation, Enugu, Mrs. Onyinye Mamah, and the Centre Manager, Enugu State Tamar Sexual Assault Referral Centre (TARMA SARC), Ms Evelyn Onah, who serves as Secretary of the Committee.\n\nResponding, the Commissioner for Gender Affairs and Social Development, Princess Nnaji, thanked Gov.

          "text": "The Federal Government has announced it is going ahead with arrangements for deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) Technology in the telecommunications industry.\n\nThe government allayed fears and concerns on health and security implications over deployment of 5G, asserting Nigeria cannot afford to be left behind.\n\nIt added the resources and revenues to be earned from the deployment are so huge they cannot be ignored.\n\nExecutive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Prof Umar Garba Danbatta, announced these at the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between NCC and the Nigerian Communications Satellite limited (NigComSat) at the headquarters of the Commission in Abuja.\n\nThe MoU between the two agencies under the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy would lay the foundations for acquisition of Frequency Spectrum suitable for the deployment of the technology in the country.\n\nDanbatta said the NigComSat, it was discovered after investigation across the globe, had the appropriate technology to facilitate the deployment.\n\nDanbatta said: \u201cAmongst the Frequency Spectrum bands allocated to 5G by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU, the C-band (3.4GHz \u2013 3.9GHz) stands out because its balancing point between coverage and capacity provides the perfect environment for 5G connectivity.\n\n\u201cThe C-band is most suitable and appropriate for immediate deployment of 5G services taking into consideration availability of device ecosystem with 60-70% of global commercial 5G network deployment currently in the band, thus the importance of this Spectrum for early deployment of 5G services in Nigeria cannot be over emphasized.\n\n\u201cFor optimal 5G service performance, an average of contiguous 100 MHz of spectrum in the C-band is required by an Operator. However in Nigeria, only 120 MHz of the band (3.4 \u2013 3.52) GHz is available for mobile services while the remaining 680 MHz (3.52 \u2013 4.2) GHz of the band is used by NigComSat (NG-1R) satellites.\n\n\u201cThe Commission initiated negotiation with NIGCOMSAT whom in our estimate could make some adjustment to its satellite operation and release part of its Spectrum holding in the band to facilitate the deployment of 5G in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe two agencies have been in discussions on how to relocate the operations of NG-1R to the standard C-band 300MHz (3.9GHz \u2013 4.2GHz) potion of the band, which is more suitable in terms of Satellite service offering because end user terminal are cheaper there, while leaving the non-standard C-band 400MHz (3.5GHz \u2013 3.9GHz) portion of the band for 5G use.\n\n\u201cThe cost of relocating the NG-1R is expected to be offset from the proceeds of the auction of the 5G Spectrum.\n\nManaging Director of NigComSat, Dr Abimbola Alale, lauded the committees set by the two agencies for doing a thorough job in the larger interest of the country.\n\nShe said the MoU would change the narratives of digital and telecommunications industry in the country.\n\nChairman of the NCC board, Prof Adeolu Akande the time has come for the country to key into adoption and deployment of 5G technology.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, precisely from the last quarter of 2019, several administrations have begun to license Spectrum for commercial deployment of 5G.\n\n\u201d As we speak today, 5G services have already been deployed in United States of America, South Korea, United Kingdom, China, South Africa, Kenya and many more\u201d, Akande said.\n\nAccording to him, telecommunication evolution has led to improvement in user experience witnessed from 2G, 3G and later 4G.",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nGovernors of southern Nigerian states under the aegis of the Southern Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum met on Tuesday evening to discuss the state of the nation.\n\nThe meeting held virtually at the instance of Governors Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) and David Umahi (Ebonyi) to solutions to end the regional and broader national security crisis.\n\nAkeredolu, Okowa and Umahi are chairmen of the South West, South-South and South East Governors\u2019 Forums, respectively.\n\nThe governors met just as the Ondo State Security Network (\u201cOperation Amotekun\u201d) evicted 137 illegal occupiers of Government Forest Reserves at Iron in Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State.\n\nThe affected persons, mostly of Fulani background, claimed they had access to the land through the collaboration of local chiefs in the area.\n\nThe Ondo State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, in a statement made available to Daily Sunf, said that 15 of the 17 governors from the south attended the meeting.\n\nThey included the Ekiti State Governor who doubles as Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), David Umahi(Ebonyi), Godwin Obaseki (Edo) and Lolo Cecilia Ezeilo (Deputy Governor of Enugu State, representing Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi).\n\nOthers are: Douye Diri (Bayelsa), Emmanuel Udom (Akwa Ibom), Okezie Victor Ikpeazu (Abia), Hope Uzodinma (Imo), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos).\n\nThe governors, who called for commitment and unity in addressing issues that affect the country, particularly southern Nigeria, stressed the need to put the country first.\n\nAs part of their resolution, the governors agreed to meet in Asaba, the Delta State capital, next week to harmonise their positions aimed at dousing rising tensions in the country.\n\n\u201cThe three governors, especially the chairman of the South West Governors\u2019 Forum have provided good leadershop and direction to the extent that a proper path to confidence building has been laid,\u2019 a source close to one ot the governors told Daily Sun.\n\n\u2018It is coming a bit late but it has largely shown that there are still leaders who think of the nation\u2019s unity first before any other. The kernel of the meeting was that Nigeria is too important to let [fall] into conflagration. It\u2019s a good move, no doubt.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the illegal occupants of the Ondo forest reserves were apprehended at Elegbeka forest along Ifon-Owo road on their arrival from unknown destinations.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu had a few weeks ago ordered the eviction of illegal occupants of the state government forest reserves who refused to register with government.\n\nThe governor\u2019s action followed the murder of the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Adegoke Adeusi, who was shot dead on the Owo-Ifon route a few months ago.\n\nIn an interview, the Commander of Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, stated that the illegal forest occupants had to be escorted out of Ondo State to their places of origin.\n\n\u2018We got intel that very many people bombarded the forests reserves at legbeka\u2013Ifon area in the state. We moved in and, on questioning, a majority of them said they were from the northern part of the country.\n\n\u2018We asked for thier mission but they were not able to give us a clear cut of what they are here for. We brought some of them [to Akure] and their sponsors here to the headquarters [of Amotekun] for proper investigation.\n\n\u2018We profiled them and we found out that they were conniving with some persons in Ose to be given space for settlement in the government\u2019s forest reserve, which makes them illegal occupants of the forests. We are sending them back to where they claimed they came from,\u2019 Adeleye said.",

          "text": "\u2022Threatens to \u2018ruffle unruly feathers\u2019\n\n\u2022Accusation baseless, PDP, Afenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN fire back\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe presidency yesterday accused some religious and political leaders of plotting to forcibly remove President Muhammadu Buhari from office, warning that it would thwart the moves and ruffle some unruly feathers in the process.\n\nThe presidency, however, came under fire as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere; the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in separate reactions dismissed the allegation.\n\nThe main opposition party described the allegation as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nAfenifere said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said in a statement that available evidence indicated that some disgruntled religious and past political leaders are poised to throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel an undemocratic change of leadership.\n\nAdesina\u2019s statement came a day after the Department of State Services (DSS) alleged that some \u201cmisguided elements\u201d were threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nDSS spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Monday, had said that among those threatening the federal government and Nigeria\u2019s unity are \u201csome religious and past political leaders who have either called for a forceful change of government or mass action against it.\u201d\n\nThe presidency in a reaction to the DSS yesterday said there is proof that the disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of a conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed on the president, thus throwing the land into turmoil.\n\nIt stated: \u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country. The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nIt added that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999 and the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\u201d\n\nThe presidency also accused external forces of collaborating with some individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such moves.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country. But the presidency, already vested with mandate and authority by Nigerians till 2023, pledges to keep the country together, even if some unruly feathers would be ruffled in the process,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some analysts told THISDAY last night that the presidency might have been reacting to a grand move by some past leaders of the country to hold a conference to discuss the state of the nation, which they said had been hemmed by massive violence from non-state actors, including bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and separatist elements.\n\nThe conference being facilitated by a former head of state is expected to be attended by leaders of prominent regional political groups, civil society organisations, religious leaders and past political office holders.\n\nThe groundwork had reached an advanced stage and state intelligence agencies and the presidency, the analysts, said may have panicked in the fear that the conference in dissecting the litany of woes that have befallen the country may throw up conversations and conclusions that are certain to embarrass the Buhari administration.\n\nThis is Blackmail, PDP Fires Back\n\nReacting to the allegation, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed it, describing it as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe PDP said rather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing the nation, the presidency was engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that the Buhari presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically-elected government.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cThe presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically-elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood.\n\n\u201cEven in 2019, Nigerians will be quick to remember how the APC imported bandits, vandals and thugs from neighbouring countries, as political mercenaries, to unleash violence, disrupt our voting processes and muscle itself into power.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the presidency and the APC to look inwards for those allegedly plotting to upturn democracy.\n\n\u201cOur party believes that the statement by the Buhari presidency is an attempt by the APC to heighten political tension in our country ahead of the 2023 election, having realised that they cannot face the people at the polls,\u201d it added.\n\nThe PDP, however, advised the APC to know that such blackmail against Nigerians cannot work.\n\n\u201cFor us in the PDP, our party will remain undeterred, alongside other patriotic Nigerians, in our commitment towards the sustenance and stability of our democracy as well as the unity and corporate existence of our country, Nigeria,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN Dismiss allegation\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF and the CAN also dismissed the allegation by the presidency that some religious and political leaders are part of a plot to overthrow Buhari.\n\nThe leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the whole world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that given Buhari\u2019s poor performance, there is no need for any group to \u201cgather anywhere to pass a vote of no confidence in him.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo, who described the 1999 Constitution as a fraud, also urged the president to, as a matter of urgency, return the 1964 Constitution agreed on by the founding fathers of Nigeria, including the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho is interested in passing vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him? That is not the issue. The main thing is to restructure the country back to federalism and forget all these gossips by Adesina. We don\u2019t have to pass a vote of no confidence for the world to know we don\u2019t have any confidence in Buhari.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any group who wants to take over the government, but I know those of us who want the country to be restructured in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cThose of us in Afenifere and all other groups in the South who are agitating for restructuring are the friends of Nigeria, are the friends of Buhari. I hope it is not too late for Buhari to realise this.\u201d\n\nACF also said it was wrong for the presidency to see all its critics as disgruntled people with ulterior motives.\n\nThe spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, told THISDAY that the presidency should be broad-minded and tolerate all shades of opinions.\n\nAccording to him, many criticisms against the government are done in good faith to help improve the situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany criticisms are done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the president and his team were becoming confused.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president and his team have gone blind and confused since in their world view, Rev. Father Mbaka and others who are telling them the truth about what is happening in the country have now become enemies.\n\n\u201cYou should know they have run out of excuses and have turned to blackmail even those who love them and want them to do what is good for the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEvery religious leader who chooses to stand with the people and is demanding good governance is now disgruntled.\u201d\n\nThe CAN chairman said the presidency needed \u201cto pause a little and remember that these people whom they are calling names today stood with them and for them when those who think they know them more warned against it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians have since passed their vote on Buhari and his government after watching helplessly how bandits have taken over the country; our young university students are being killed and destroyed.\u201d\n\nHayab appealed to those who are making statements on behalf of the presidency to be careful with their poor words and strive to win the support and confidence of the people with love and facts, not blackmail.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the CAN President on Media and Communications, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said beyond praying for things to get better, religious leaders reserved the right to criticise the authorities if they were not doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf the government accused some religious and past political leaders of planning to remove President Muhammadu Buhari, in what ways has that concerned the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)? The biblical responsibilities of the church include but not limited to praying for those who are in the position of authority but to criticise when doing wrongs or performing below the average. Check the Bible; there was never a time a bad ruler was spared from criticism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the government should pre-occupy itself with how best to tackle insecurity and ensure the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cOur candid advice to the government is to find an answer to the menace of insecurity occasioned by the bandits, kidnappers and terrorists. The country is approaching the precipice and President Muhammadu Buhari is in the position of rescuing the country by stopping the unprecedented bloodshed.\n\n\u201cIt is only the fool that goes to bed when his roof is on fire. Our members and non-members are being kidnapped and killed while the government appears helpless,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, fixing the security challenges is beyond issuing press releases or threatening to deal with the criminals.\n\nHe stated that 24 hours after Buhari vowed never to tolerate any banditry attack on schools, the bandits struck, adding that the victims are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cWhat is the government doing to rescue the victims? Some university students who were kidnapped in Kaduna are being killed but the government is too busy threatening the critics. We advise the presidency to recall all the promises made by Buhari during the electioneering and what is happening under his watch. Until his government wakes up to its responsibilities, the church will not keep quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a reaction, PANDEF National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, expressed shock that the presidency would under the prevailing situation of disastrous insecurity tag religious leaders and past political leaders \u201cdisgruntled.\u201d\n\nHe said such a statement was the least expected from government.\n\nThe group urged the presidency to stop chasing shadows, stressing that Nigerians are anxious, troubled and many are becoming hopeless over the worsening insecurity, while the security agencies appear helpless and vulnerable.\n\nPANDEF asked Buhari to involve all critical stakeholders nationwide in efforts at finding solutions to the problems facing the nation.\n\nIt said: \u201cWhat we expect from President Muhammadu Buhari, at this time, is to rally all critical stakeholders, from all sectors and sections of the country, to build national consensus and fashion out collective and holistic ways to address the hybrid problems confronting the country.

          "text": "\u2022Abductors free one more captive\n\n\u2022Security council meeting continues today\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed its commitment to do all it could to save the remaining 16 students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, whose abductors have threatened to kill for the delay in ransoming them.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja where he faulted the recommendations by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in resolving the growing insecurity in the country, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the federal government, in line with its constitutional responsibility of protecting all Nigerians, would not fold its arms and allow the bandits who kidnapped the students execute them.\n\nThe bandits had on Monday threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom was not met by yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by yesterday, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nOf the about 22 students abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm, the bandits have killed five.\n\nHowever, the bandits might have reconsidered their decision to kill the remaining students yesterday as one of them was freed under a yet-to-be-clear circumstances. Their parents also appealed to the bandits to spare the lives of the students.\n\nAt the press conference in Abuja, Mohammad also spoke on efforts by the federal government to combat the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHowever, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the three service chiefs will tomorrow brief the Senate on their efforts so far to address the security problems.\n\nMohammed also faulted the recommendations by the PDP in resolving the security crisis, saying the contents of its recent press conference had exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of Monday\u2019s press briefing by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in which he canvassed, among others, state police, devolution of powers and the establishment of border protection council, as part of steps to combat insecurity.\n\nMohammed accused PDP of merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\nThe minister also threatened to expose the forces behind the current security challenges at the \u2018\u2019appropriate time\u2019\u2019 and deal with them.\n\nHe stated that the alarm raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) on the plot by some powerful forces to destabilise the government only confirmed the consistent position of the federal government that there were plots by some political forces to make the country ungovernable.\n\nHe said the federal government was shocked that \u2018\u2019a party that ruled the country for all of 16 years does not know that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offences.\u201d\n\nIt advised the PDP to call out the states, including those being controlled by it, to ensure a rigorous prosecution of arrested kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u2018\u2019PDP conveniently forgot that as far as terrorism, a federal offence, is concerned, this federal government has successfully prosecuted thousands of Boko Haram members in Kainji, as part of a continuing exercise. We are now seeking the cooperation of the judiciary to continue with the trial of arrested terrorists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister explained that while PDP claimed to have ostensibly offered suggestions to the federal government on some topical issues, especially national security by dropping the toga of politics in the national interest, the party played cheap politics.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019The party went ahead to make wild accusations against the president and his government. For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a government of exclusion.\n\n\u2018\u2019The opposition party then went ahead to reel out a number of suggestions as a way out of the current challenges facing the nation. Unfortunately, the recommendations by the PDP have exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry, and the fact that it was merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\n\u2018\u2019Had it not been so, and had it done its homework properly, the PDP would have known that most of those same recommendations were already contained in the outcome of the federal government\u2019s town hall meeting on national security, which was held in Kaduna on April 8, 2021,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\n\nAbductors Free One More Kaduna Student\n\nMeanwhile, one of the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, has been released.\n\nThe mother of the released student, Mrs. Lauretta Attahiru, confirmed this yesterday to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nShe, however, declined to make further comments on how her son was released.\n\nThe police could not also be reached to confirm the release of the student as Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police command, did not respond to telephone calls and a text message.\n\nThe parents had earlier said the bandits had been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20 million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students remained uncertain yesterday, especially given the bandits\u2019 threat to kill them over the inability to ransom them.\n\nAlso yesterday, the President of the National Association of Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTA), Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, pleaded with the bandits to spare the lives of their victims.\n\nDanjuma told journalists in Kaduna that the parents of the affected students and Nigerians had been gripped by fear and tension following the threat by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cWe are simply begging them not to kill any other student in view of the fact that they are innocent.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is really worrisome and we as parents, are concerned and worried over the lives of our students and teachers of the university,\u201d he said.\n\nA former senator who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, also appealed to Fulani socio-cultural groups to intercede to secure the release of the students.\n\nSani tweeted that he had privately appealed to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore to help secure the release of the students.\n\nSecurity Council Meeting Continues Today\n\nMeanwhile, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja, to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting, which will be the third in less than a week, will as usual be presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIndications that the meeting will continue today was emerged when yesterday\u2019s meeting ended without any media briefing or press statement issued.\n\nAlso, the President of the Senate, Dr .Ahmad Lawan, at Senate plenary on why the CDS and the service chiefs could not appear before the senators yesterday, said at the commencement of plenary that the military top brass could not honour invitation due to the National Security Council meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, the National Security Council is continuing its meeting that it started last week. Therefore the invited security heads will not be able to come for the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure if they will finish their meeting today (Tuesday). We assume it could spill to Wednesday too,\u201d he added.\n\nLawan, however, said the CDS and the service chiefs would brief the Senate tomorrow on the security situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have now fixed the date for the briefing to be Thursday, May 6,\u201d adding that the briefing will enrich the knowledge of his colleagues about security issues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Mergers of MDAs, budget review on the card\n\n\u2022Akabueze proposes six-region structure\n\nNdubuisi Francis, Olawale Ajimotokan and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has initiated a raft of measures to cut the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue occasioned by the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant global economic tailspin.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said yesterday in Abuja that the measures were targeted at reducing recurrent expenditure, which is projected to gulp about 41.5 per cent of the total provisions of N13.588 trillion in the 2021 budget, amounting to N5.64 trillion.\n\nShe stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the salaries and wages committee to review the payroll of public servants as well as consider the merger of some agencies.\n\nBesides, the government will also remove some unnecessary items from the budget as a move to cut the cost of governance.\n\nAhmed spoke at a policy dialogue on \u2018corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practice and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nAlso at the occasion, the Director-General, Budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, proposed a constitutional amendment to pave the way for the restructuring of the country into six regions instead of the present 36 states structure. This, he said, would help to reduce the rising cost of governance.\n\nAhmed stated that the proposed cost-saving measures was aimed at streamlining government expenditure with revenue.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue.\u201d\n\nShe urged all government agencies to come together to trim the cost amid the country\u2019s dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the nation\u2019s budgets are filled every year with projects that are recycled and that are also not necessary.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair, work together with the head of service and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister said the federal government would also review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates, adding that the government will consider merging two agencies with the same mandate.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe need to work together; all agencies of the government to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures\u2013expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year-in-year out with projects that we see over and over again and also projects that are not necessary.\u201d\n\nAkabueze, in a paper titled: \u2018Reducing the Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 described the country\u2019s current system of democratic governance as very expansive and expensive.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that mandated the president to appoint a minister from at least each of the 36 states, should be amended to reduce the number of federal cabinet members.\n\nHe cited the large federal structure to be one of the drivers of the high cost of governance and engendering public outcry that government spending is largely on recurrent activities at the expense of capital projects.\n\nWhile describing the subsisting fiscal policy as unsustainable, Akabueze said the persistent call for the reduction of governance cost had continued to gain momentum in view of its impact on government fiscal situation.\n\nHe stated that the cost of governance is considerably cheaper in the United States from where Nigeria copied the presidential system of government.\n\nAccording to him, the general cost of administration in the United States is less than 10 per cent of the total annual budgets while the United States, with a higher population than Nigeria, has only 15 secretaries and executive departments as against Nigeria, which has 27 ministers, 16 ministers of state and 27 ministries.\n\nHe lamented that the federal government is maintaining 943 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) with many of them having duplicated functions.\n\n\u201cThere are 541 federal government-owned public corporations and enterprises. We need to cut these in order to install efficiency in governance. Also, we have a bloated civil service. The current civil service structure and size is clearly unsustainable for Nigeria\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warned against the tendency where the civil service is accorded political, ethnic and religious patronage.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive staff auditing and job available is imperative to determine the right size of the federal civil service without having any adverse effect on the service. And to avoid duplication in the civil service, the staff rationalisation programme should be gradual,\u201d he added.\n\nAkabueze said the federal government\u2019s recurrent spending accounted for more than 75 per cent of the actual MDAs expenditure between 2011 and 2020, in addition to personnel cost which accounted for government significant spending.\n\nHe accused the MDAs of incurring excessive personnel costs and wilfully indulging in wide range of underhand practices that are driving governance cost out of the ordinary.\n\nAccording to him, in 2016, personnel cost was N1.87 trillion while at the moment the same cost has spiralled to over N3 trillion.\n\nThe effect of the rising cost of running government, Akabueze added, is the reason why only 30 per cent of the budget is available for capital project and the cause behind many abandoned capital projects nationwide.\n\nHe said: \u201cPersonnel cost accounted for 31 per cent and 63 per cent of the total spending and retained revenue in 2020. In the USA, the general administration cost is less than 10 per cent of total budget.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe challenged Nigerians to task themselves on governance, saying that the success story of the Asian Tiger was a product of sound leadership and determination.\n\nICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, described the cost of governance as the driver of corruption in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government was committed to improving the country\u2019s revenue by focusing on new and existing sources and by streamlining payroll.\n\nHe added that the federal government would also ensure removal of subsidies and reduction in the cost of contracts and procurement are for the benefits of the vulnerable.\n\nHe listed critical area of concern to include payroll padding and the phenomenon of ghost workers.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s intended cost-cutting approach is coming amid a report by a public finance transparency advocacy firm, BudgIT that the 2021 federal budget contains over 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion.\n\nBudgIT, a public finance transparency advocacy firm, said in a report that the duplication of projects was just one among other loopholes for corruption in the budget.\n\nIt added that there were no audit records of N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\n\nIt said: \u201cOur investigations into the 2021 budget revealed at least 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion, with 115 of those duplicate projects occurring in the Ministry of Health. This is very disturbing, especially considering the health infrastructure deficit and the raging COVID-19 pandemic affecting Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBudgIT also found zero audit records of the N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\u201d\n\nIt also alleged that budgetary provisions were made for agencies for projects that are beyond their execution. It added: \u201cEven worse, agencies now receive allocations for capital projects they cannot execute. For example, the National Agriculture Seed Council has an allocation for N400m to construct solar street lights across all six geopolitical zones, while the Federal College of Forestry in Ibadan in Oyo State got N50m for the construction of street lights in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThese are aberrations that need to be corrected.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Don Jazzy, CEO of Mavin Records, says his views about marriage are always changing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with BBC Pidgin, the 38-year-old music producer also opened up on his failed marriage to Michelle Jackson whom he divorced at 22.\n\n\u201cMy views about marriage? It\u2019s not easy. It is always changing. Sometimes, I\u2019m up for it. Other times, I\u2019m like, \u2018are we even supposed to get married?\u2019 After I married young, it looked as though the music was picking gradually,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d started seeing minute signs. But late nights in the studio, going on road trips for performances had you leaving your wife at home. It\u2019s hard to explain. I was lucky the person I married understood that music meant a lot to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that it wouldn\u2019t be easy for me to combine that with always having to go back home to family. And I was still young. So I had to make that decision to face my music squarely and I\u2019ve been loyal to this music until now.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew but it wasn\u2019t for them to share. I\u2019ve revealed everyone I\u2019ve dated in the past. I\u2019m not hiding it. No one just felt the need to say, \u2018He used to be married.\u2019 When I\u2019m in a relationship, it\u2019s not in my nature to share it.\u201d\n\nResponding to fans\u2019 on how he felt letting his music obsession end his marriage to Michelle, Don Jazzy said: \u201cI have no regrets. I\u2019ve been able to bless life by being a success story. I don\u2019t have any child that I know of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s married and has a child now.

          "text": "Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu started Carry1st in 2018 to publish mobile games and interactive content for Africans. One of their games, Carry1st Trivia, got a lot of buzz in 2020 with about one and a half million downloads.\n\nIn the three years since its launch, Carry1st has also become a medium for bringing mobile gaming from global companies to Africa. The Cape Town-based company realised that developers have had problems with distribution and payments in Africa.\n\nThey decided to solve that by embedding a fintech solution, Pay1st, on their platform. Pay1st features popular payment methods from six African countries, giving African gamers on Carry1st the ability to pay how they want.\n\nThe result is a company that is a publishing platform for games but also a full-stack management solution for game developers seeking user acquisition, marketing and monetization in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we were able to successfully sign 7 great titles, recruit a top-notch international team, and build out our payments and digital commerce platform,\u201d Robbin-Coker, CEO of Carry1st, said in a statement.\n\nRight to Left: Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu, Carry1st co-founders. Image source: Carry1st.\n\nNow the startup is positioned to take advantage of the stability and opportunity they have found. They have announced the close of a $6 million Series A round led by Konvoy Ventures, an early-stage VC firm based in the US State of Colorado. Carry1st joins a list of other gaming companies on Konvoy\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJackson Vaughan, Managing Partner at Konvoy Ventures, joins Carry1st\u2019s board as a result of the investment. He said Carry1st\u2019s advantage is in \u201capproaching sub-regions with contextual understanding.\u201d\n\nOther investors in the round include Riot Games (the company behind \u2018League of Legends\u2019), Raine Ventures, AET Fund / Akatsuki and TTV Capital.\n\nWith this round, Carry1st has now raised $9.5m since it was founded. The most recent funding round before this was in May 2020 when they raised $2.5million from a seed round led by CRE Venture Capital.\n\nCarry1st plans to enter new partnerships with global gaming studios. Their existing partnerships cut across continents: with Raketspel in Sweden, New York-based Cosi Games, and Ethiopian developer Qene Games.\n\nThey also intend to launch new games and scale existing ones. To achieve that, they plan to hire more staff for product, engineering, and growth. The strategy is welcome by their latest investors.\n\n\u201cAt Riot, we have seen first hand the importance of partnering with local experts to bring the best possible gaming experience to players,\u201d Brendan Mulligan, Head of Corporate Development at Riot Games, said.\n\n\u201cAs the number of gamers in Africa explodes, we\u2019re excited to work with Cordel and Carry1st as they introduce game developers from all over the world to an important and passionate audience.\u201d\n\nCarry1st could be an engine for driving the mobile gaming economy in Africa, tapping into a growing global wave.\n\n36% of all mobile app downloads in 2020 were mobile games, according to App Annie, the mobile apps analytics company. 70% of all app purchases on the Apple store and Google Play in 2020 was on games.\n\nThe upward trajectory in mobile game spend is set to continue this year, reaching $120 billion.",

          "text": "Lami, a Kenyan insurtech company democratizing insurance products and services for low-income Kenyans, has raised $1.8 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Accion Venture Lab.\n\nFounded by Jihan Abass in 2018, Lami is a digital insurance platform that enables partner businesses \u2013 including banks, tech companies, and other entities to easily and seamlessly offer digital insurance products to their users via its API.\n\nLami can also be used by partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs. Through its API, users can get a quotation for motor, medical, or other tailored insurance products in seconds, then customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit their needs. They get their policy documents instantly and claims are paid in record time.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal Abass said, \u201cSimilar to a payment API/gateway, we process insurance KYC, pricing of products, underwriting of products and claims processing in real time. Let me give you an example, Jumia wanted to launch an insurance marketplace but they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of integrating with every single insurance company and they didn\u2019t want to manage the process of issuing policies. Using our API because we have 20 insurance companies on our platform, they were able to launch this marketplace with a large number of products.\u201d\n\nJulian Abbas Founder & CEO\n\nThe Insurance space in Africa\n\nWith a 3% penetration rate (except for South Africa), Africa\u2019s insurance market is lagging behind. In Kenya where Lami is based less than 20% of the population has access to health insurance.\n\nThe major cause of the low adoption is that most insurance providers on the continent fail to offer flexible, affordable and tailored insurance coverage that can provide a safety net for the African consumer. For example, under most health policies customers face restrictions on what facilities and treatments are covered, they struggle to understand coverage terms and face complicated and lengthy claims processes. This results in a longer processing cycle, poor customer satisfaction, and higher distribution costs.\n\nLami\u2019s services are enabled by its flexible insurance rating engine and direct integration with several parties and insurance companies. Lami co-designs innovative products with its underwriting partners to enable businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base, with flexible options that meet their needs and cash flows, such as monthly medical policies for startup employees.\n\nLami\u2019s CEO Jihan Abass said, \u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more people, improving our technology, and growing our presence across Africa as we can continue to address the persistent insurance gap. At Lami, our vision is to help improve the financial resilience of millions by making insurance products more accessible and affordable for underserved populations. By enabling our business partners to offer customized insurance solutions, we are helping them provide more value to their customers, while enabling large volumes of users to access insurance, often for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe Lami team at work\n\nSince its inception, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies and has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer, and Madison Insurance, distributing more than 30 products available including medical, motor, employee benefits, and device insurance. As an innovator in the digital insurance space, Lami aims to continue diversifying its business by looking for new partners and building on its core technology.\n\nMichael Schlein, President and CEO, Accion Venture Lab, said, \u201cNinety-seven percent of Africans lack access to insurance \u2013 a financial safety net that can help them build resilience against economic shocks. Lami helps address this need for consumers across Africa through its innovative approach that leverages technology and partnerships to help any business develop and sell insurance.\u201d\n\nWithin the past month Malian insurtech OKO and Nigerian insurtech Curacel raised a combined amount of $1.6 million, Lami\u2019s funding news is a reminder that there\u2019s some activity in the African insurtech space. Also, with less than 5% of venture capital going to female-led startups in 2019, it\u2019s positive news to see another female-led company being funded.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fourth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nKidato raises $1.4m | Newsbites\n\nComments",

Therefore, the way we think about university and the purpose of university must also change.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the role of technology in education and the role of technology in transforming lives. We cannot ignore that fact and continue to believe that it is not relevant.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge I am sure you will have to deal with is that of funding the university.

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has warned government officials against the duplication of projects in the national budget.\n\nIt also cautioned lawmakers against such duplication in their annual zonal Intervention projects, commonly called the constituency project.\n\nICPC chairman, Bolaji Owasanoye, issued the warning, Tuesday, at a Policy Dialogue on Corruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria in Abuja.\n\nThe event, which held virtually, was organised by the training and research arm of ICPC, Anti-Corruption Academy of Nigeria (ACAN).\n\nIt had in attendance the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, and other dignitaries.\n\nIn his presentation, Mr Owasanoye lamented that despite the millions budgeted for the funding of the over-two-decade community projects annually, thousands of these projects are left without \u201ddiligent scrutiny of need, implementation or otherwise.\n\nHe added that some of the legislative constituency projects are duplicated featuring as projects of the executive.\n\n\u2018RCCG exposed project duplication\u2019\n\nCiting a recent case of a road project duplication, the anti-graft agency\u2019s chairman identified how the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) alerted the public on a road project it had implemented as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) but was also awarded as an executive project.\n\nHe said his commission would not only track selected projects but would also digitise the records executive and constituency projects.\n\nHe said, \u201dThousands of projects are repeated annually in the budget without diligent scrutiny of need, implementation or otherwise. Some are duplicated as annual zonal intervention projects otherwise called constituency projects of the legislature while also featuring as projects of the executive.\n\n\u201dFunding is released for both insertions without any mechanism for monitoring and evaluation and reconciliation of funding. Recently the RCCG blew the whistle on a road project it had implemented as CSR but which suddenly was \u2018inadvertently\u2019 awarded as an executive project.\n\n\u201dThe incident rightly became the subject of an inquiry by the legislature. ICPC\u2019s response to this challenge is not only to track selected projects but we annually digitise executive and constituency projects and upload same on our website for citizen verification through our toll-free line.\u201d\n\nHe called on Nigerians to visit its website for the breakdown of constituency projects for 2021, urging the public to become watchdogs of projects in their communities.\n\n\u201dThe breakdown of projects for 2021 has already been uploaded on our website and we encourage the public to become watchdogs of projects in their communities. We are working with the budget office to track funding of such projects as we prepare for our 2021 tracking of the constituency and executive projects,\u201d he added.\n\nOthers speak\n\nIn his remarks, Tunde Babawale, who is the acting provost, Anti-corruption Academy of Nigeria (ACAN), said wasteful practices are often seen in the country in the forms of duplication of functions across Ministries Department and Agencies (MDAs), embezzlement of public funds, kickbacks from contracts, procurement fraud, and the diversion of public funds into private hands.\n\nThe professor said there would be significant progress in the country if the wasteful practices of public officials can be curbed.\n\nOn her part, the Finance Minister, Mrs Ahmed, said the need for the reduction of cost of governance was in line with President Buhari\u2019s policy for a review of government payroll.\n\n\u201cWhile working to increase revenue, we will work to reduce the high cost of governance and I am glad that ICPC is taking this initiative as its natural mandate is to prevent corruption,\u201d she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe revealed that her ministry had designed a strategic revenue initiative that was aimed at solving the problem of revenue deficiency by expanding revenue sources, and also reducing cost by alternating processes that give room for corruption such as IPPIS, GIFMIS.\n\nShe also stated that a transparency portal had been launched to provide access to citizens to view transactions from agencies and monitor how the government was performing its transactions.\n\nBudgIT revelation\n\nMr Owasanoye\u2019s comment comes amid a revelation by BudgIT Nigeria, a civic tech group, in its latest report issued on Tuesday, showing that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved an estimated 316 duplicated projects in the \u20a613.6 trillion 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cOur analysis of the 2021Budget reveals over 316 duplicated capital projects totalling N39.5bn, among other loopholes for corruption,\u201d BudgIT said in the report.\n\nBudgIT also said it also found zero audit records of the N10.02tn received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\n\nThe zonal intervention projects were first introduced in Nigeria during the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999. It was conceived to ensure equity in the allocation of projects sited in the constituencies of state and federal lawmakers by various Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of government in the budgets of the federation or state.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES in July 2019 reported the ICPC, saying an estimated N2 trillion was spent on constituency projects in Nigeria since the year 2000 without commensurate development at the grassroots.\n\nSimilarly, President Muhammadu Buhari had also in 2019 said there have been very little benefits to the grassroots from the \u20a61 trillion that had been earmarked for constituency projects in the last 10 years.",

Femi Gbajabiamila, advised the Federal Government to suspend the exercise till such a time the country was safe enough for it.\n\nThe resolution of the House was passed following a motion moved by a member representing Bosso/Paikoro Federal Constituency of Niger State, Rep. Shehu Beji.\n\nLeading the debate on the motion, the lawmaker told the House that several factors would work against the accuracy of the figures that would be obtained and the overall success of the exercise due largely to insecurity, according to Newsguru.\n\nFor instance, Beji said, the safety of enumerators would not be guaranteed in many parts of the country.\n\nHe also stated that many households would be unwilling to make family members available for enumeration because of the fear of the unknown.\n\nHe added that it would be unwise in the prevailing circumstances to post enumerators to some parts of the country currently considered to be volatile.\n\nBeji argued that the fact that many locations would not be reached by enumerators was enough a reason to suspend the planned exercise.\n\nThe key prayer of his motion urged the House to \u201ccall on the Federal Government to suspend the exercise until the security of the country stabilises.\u201d\n\nThe prayer was endorsed by the House in a majority voice vote.\n\nThe House also invited the Chairman of the NPC, Nasir Isa Kwarra, to explain the feasibility of conducting a population and housing census in the country amid the current security challenges.",

NALDA\u2019s Integrated Farm Estate is going to be cited in Ogun State in the three senatorial districts of the state. The Integrated Farm Estate is a concept that takes in everything from production to processing, packaging and marketing, we also have residential areas for farmers inside the integrated Farm Estate.\n\n\u201cKnowing that Ogun has the highest capacity in cassava production, our Garri Packaging Plant will be located in the state, thereby NALDA will be the off-taker from the farmers, we process it, package it accordingly and move it into the market.\n\n\u201cWe are training young Nigerians based on the President\u2019s directives on soil testing and extension services, so Ogun State is expected to nominate 200 people in the first phase. Again, Ogun is one of the states in the pilot stage of this programme, it will nominate young graduates that have agric or science related degrees that will undertake this intensive two week training.\n\n\u201cThey will be empowered by NALDA with soil test kits and implements to collect soil samples after the training and they will begin to generate money for themselves, thereby making a living from the programme,\u201d he said.\n\nHe disclosed that NALDA would not sit back and watch the state improve the worth of agriculture alone, \u201cthe Authority would also be re-activating the 700 hectares of land at Joga-Orile immediately, with the hope that the reactivation will increase the status of the state in food production\u201d.\n\nResponding, Governor Abiodun attributed the success of his administration\u2019s agriculture project to the support of the President Muhammad Buhari-led government, adding that his administration holds agriculture as a \u201ctriple barrel pillar\u201d that allows the state to feed its people, create employment, as well as generate revenue for the state.\n\nAbiodun who also noted that his administration recently started the construction of its International Cargo Airport to boost the agric sector, said that the state also won a bid to become a special agric processing zone, with the state using the advantage of the cargo airport that seats on a 5,000 hectares of land to its advantage.\n\nHe assured NALDA of administration\u2019s support, especially with provision of land for the purpose of the Integrated Farm Estate.\n\nThe governor submitted that his administration would also set up a team to look at ways of starting the Garri Packaging Plant in quick time and ensure that the youths and graduates benefit from the training programme on soil testing and extension services.",

The standards are an important measure to advance the equalization of basic public services, he added.\n\nIn recent years, China has been witnessing increasingly improved basic public services. There are 6.51 hospital beds available per 1,000 people, and the country\u2019s radio and television services cover over 99 percent of its territory. Compulsory education is developing in a balanced manner in most of China\u2019s counties. Critical illness insurance program, social assistance system, elderly care, and other major mechanisms that concern the minimum standard of living have been gradually established optimized.\n\nBesides, China has also built the world\u2019s largest social security system. As of the end of the last year, the per capita basic living allowance in urban areas of the country had reached 678 yuan ($105) per month and 5,962 yuan per year, and the number of Chinese covered by insurance against old age, medical problems, unemployment, and work injuries had reached 999 million, 1.36 billion, 217 million and 268 million, respectively.\n\nThe Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 proposed to obviously improve the equalization of basic public services by 2025, and that basic public services must be equalized by 2035.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the new standards on basic public services, local governments shall offer lifestyle and health assessment, physical examination, auxiliary examination and health guidance services for citizens aged 65 years and older once a year, and offer them traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physique analysis and health guidance once every year.\n\nIn addition, children aged between 0 and 6 can receive 13 free physical examinations, and those between 0 and 3 can get TCM recuperation twice a year.\n\nThe new standards request to offer subsidies for eligible seniors. For instance, the government shall subsidize elderly care services for seniors experiencing economic hardships, and offer nursing subsidies for those who can\u2019t take care of themselves because of illnesses. Senior citizens aged 80 years and above shall enjoy advanced age allowance.\n\nAccording to incomplete statistics, by the end of the last year, a total of more than 30 million senior citizens across China had received subsidies, which practically solved the problems faced by many seniors.\n\nThe new standards stipulate that permanent residents aged 35 years and above who suffer from primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes shall be offered free health management services by health care organizations. Such patients can visit community health care centers, township hospitals and village clinics for corresponding free health services.\n\nTo meet people\u2019s expectation for housing, the new standards specified basic public service items about public rental houses, renovation of rundown urban areas, and renovation of rural dilapidated houses, which will help meet the basic housing demand of those living in poverty.",

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nGovernor Rolls Out Medical Infrastructure Upgrade\n\nLagos State Government has embarked on a total overhaul of infrastructure across all levels of its healthcare delivery system. Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi broke the news at the ongoing inter-ministerial press briefing organised to mark the second year anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in office.\n\nThe Commissioner said the roadmap for the upgrade of infrastructure in the State-owned health facilities began last year, following the approval of the plan by the executive council.\n\nAt the event held at the Press Centre in Alausa, Abayomi also gave account of stewardship of the Ministry\u2019s activities in the last two year.\n\nThe Commissioner explained that the infrastructure roadmap was being executed by the ministry\u2019s Medical Project Implementation Unit (MPIU) in phases, revamping facilities across primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare. He said the overhaul was part of strategy to build a resilient healthcare in Lagos and increase residents\u2019 access to quality universal health coverage.\n\nAbayomi said the effort would bring about fit-for-purpose healthcare facilities that would raise the capacity of the State Government to respond to contemporary and future health challenges, while observing that the renewal effort was being carried out in short, medium- and long-term bases.\n\nPart of the new features to be seen, the Commissioner said, will include improved efficiency for physical maintenance, ease of movement, low carbon footprint,\n\nlow energy consumption, infection prevention and control as well as staff and patient comfort.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn last one year, we have embarked on phased but comprehensive revamp of our secondary health facilities as part of our medical infrastructure upgrade roadmap which is aimed at raising access to quality and bring about efficiently run health facilities. This effort commenced in the previous year and it is expected to address issues of design errors, drainage, patient flow, staff flow, water collection, infection prevention, energy and ventilations.\n\n\u201cWe have renovated and remodeled the Mainland Hospital in Yaba with future plans of making it an Institute of Research for Infectious Disease. We have also completed the remodeling and upgraded of Apapa General Hospital, just as we currently renovate Harvey Road Health Centre, Ebute Metta Health Centre, Isolo General Hospital and the General Hospital, Odan Lagos. All of these are in the effort to make health accessible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Commissioner, the Sanwo-Olu administration has completed, equipped and handed over two multi-level Maternal and Childcare Centre (MCC) in Eti-Osa and Badagry. The construction of another 110-bed MCC, he said, has been completed in Epe and is due for commissioning in the coming weeks.\n\nAbayomi noted that the upgrade was being done in a sustainable way, which would take another decade for major repairs to be done, except statutory maintenance by the hospital management and the Lagos State Asset Maintenance Agency (LASIAMA).\n\nHe disclosed executive council had also approved the construction of new hospital to bridge gaps in access and services in health sector. This, he said, is in tandem with the determination of current administration to achieve the goals set in the Health and Environment pillar of its T.H.E.M.E.S agenda.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn fulfilment of our medical infrastructure blueprint agenda, we have commenced the construction of a 280-bed General Hospital in Ojo, 150-bed New Massey Street Children\u2019s Hospital, while the Governor has also approved the construction and equipping of 1,500-bed Psychiatric Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre at Majidun in Ketu Ejinrin.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the year, we have completed the construction of a four-storey Faculty of Basic Medical and Clinical Sciences Office Block at Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM) and plans have been concluded for renovation and upgrade of some facilities at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in tandem with our medical infrastructure blueprint strategy for the tertiary health facilities.\n\n\u201cIn partnership with the private sector, we have completed and handed over an oxygen plant at Mainland and Gbagada General Hospitals. We have delivered Traige and Oxygen Centres in 10 locations across Lagos. In raising staff welfare, we have started the construction of a 24-unit Doctors\u2019 and Staff Quarters in at Gbagada General Hospital.\u201d\n\nAbayomi also disclosed that work had begun on the blueprint designs for Comprehensive Health Center, Primary Health Center and Health Posts as part of the move to rejig their operations and service delivery. This, he said, will help in adding significant bed capacity to Lagos State\u2019s healthcare infrastructure.\n\nWhile noting that the promotion and protection of the health of residents of Lagos State has a positive impact on social development and quality of life of citizens, Abayomi disclosed that the State government embarked on the greenfield medical infrastructure projects to prevent issues noticed in health infrastructure across all levels of care in the State. He added that all issues bedeviling medical health infrastructure will disappear when the medical infrastructure blueprint strategy is fully implemented.\n\n\u201cThe continuous improvement in quality of health service in the State is a core mandate of our administration and we are uniquely positioned to utilize available resources to actualize this goal. With the ongoing refurbishment and roll out of new infrastructure blueprint, the medical infrastructure landscape of the State would look completely different, giving us a step closer to achieving universal health coverage\u201d, he stated.\n\nHe averred that medical infrastructure blueprint agenda will help address the issue of brain drain, medical travels and patient welfare stressing that the State government through the strategy hoped to endear medical tourism to the State.\n\n\u201cThe prototype of the new, remodeled and upgraded healthcare infrastructure in the state will conform with key elements of global standards health facility designs which includes Natural Light/Ventilation, Sustainable Energy, Patient Flow, Infection Prevention, Noise Prevention, Flood Prevention, Identifiable standout visual features as well as scalability and modular design for expansion\u201d, Abayomi stated.\n\nThe second wave of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), which spread more rapidly across Lagos State than the first wave, would have wreaked havoc on the country, the Commissioner said. He said the response strategy put in place by the Governor efficiently curtailed the pandemic and limited fatalities.\n\nThe Commissioner said the effectiveness of the State\u2019s response strategy saved the country from negative impacts associated with the pandemic\u2019s second wave as seen in other countries. He added that EKO TELEMED \u2013 a tech-driven platform through which the State Government managed the spread of the virus \u2013 yielded efficient results in breaking the cycle of community infection.\n\nThe Commissioner said there was an ongoing effort by the State Government to prevent third wave of the pandemic, noting that Lagos had started the deployment of EKO TELEMED in the management of in-bound international travellers from high burdened countries. The tech-driven platform, he said, would be used to monitor movement and treat infected travelers.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Prominent Islamic scholar, Ahmad Gumi should be appreciated for his efforts in seeking the release of the kidnapped students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State.\n\nThe spokesman of the parents of the kidnapped students, Friday Sanni, said this on Wednesday in an interview with The PUNCH.\n\nHe asked Nigerians to stop vilifying the cleric and accusing him of speaking for the bandits, rather he should be commended and applauded.\n\nSanni noted that with the efforts made by Gumi in securing the release of the students, he and other parents recently spoke with their children.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Honourable Sheikh, we want to commend him. We went to him and when we got to him that day, he actually told us his challenges arising from the fact that the government officials in Kaduna State and some Nigerians are accusing him of having a connection with the bandits which has become one of the hindrances he has as to how to end the banditry.\n\n\u201cHe felt that the people that are ravaging the whole place need to be reached to with a message of Islam and he established contact with them and gave them an appointment, went to the bush with them and preached to them and then make them to understand that what they are doing is wrong which every well-meaning Nigerian should be able to commend him for that but we are not doing.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident (kidnapping) took place in some states outside Kaduna, he was able to reach the bandits, talk with them and mediate between them and the families or the state governments and they were able to sort it out.\n\n\u201cBut people are asking questions; how did he know where they are? Even you (interviewer) as you are, if you have an interest in knowing where the bandits are, you will get to know the place. Remember he made a statement that the government is asking how he knows where they are and he said even the government knows where they are.\n\n\u201cBecause this clergyman is coming out to tell Nigerians what is happening in the country, some people develop unnecessary hatred for him and that is why we are where we are because we don\u2019t want to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nSanni, however, condemned the Federal and Kaduna State Government for not having the political will to secure the release of their wards.\n\nThe parents\u2019 spokesman added that the government knows the bandits\u2019 whereabouts but lacks the willpower to go after them.\n\nHe asserted that the parents preferred to pay ransom to secure their children\u2019s release and have themselves arrested later on.\n\nSanni said the parents have been emotionally, psychologically, and mentally imprisoned since the kidnap of their children 56 days ago.",

          "text": "Canada\u2019s health regulator has authorized Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12 and older.\n\nDr. Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada, on Wednesday confirmed the decision for the ages to 12 to 15 and said it will help children return to a normal life. The vaccine was previously authorized for anyone 16 or older.\n\nThe announcement comes barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorized for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is also expected to authorize the vaccine for young children by next week, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year.\n\nPfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15 showing there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots.\n\nSharma said the evidence is there that the vaccine is safe and effective in that age group. It is the first vaccine approved for children in Canada.\n\nSharma said about one-fifth of all cases in Canada have occurred in children and teenagers, and having a vaccine for them is a critical part of Canada\u2019s plan.\n\nShe said while most kids don\u2019t experience serious illness from Covid-19, a vaccine also helps protect their friends and family who may be at higher risk of complications.\n\n\u201cIt will also support the return to a more normal life for our children, who have had such a hard time over the past year,\u2033 she said.\n\nKids studied had side effects similar to young adults, the company said, mainly pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s expansion of our authorization represents a significant step forward in helping the Canadian government broaden its vaccination program and begin to help protect adolescents before the start of the next school year,\u201d Fabien Paquette, vaccines lead for Pfizer Canada, said in a statement.\n\nVaccinations have ramped in Canada in months and expects to receive at least 10 million vaccines this month. More than 34% of Canadians have received at least one dose.",
