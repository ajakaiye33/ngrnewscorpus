          "title": "[BREAKING] COVID-19 Resurgence: FG re-imposes restrictions as ECOWAS fixes tests at $50",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Imposes nationwide curfew, limits gatherings to 50 persons\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nDisturbed by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government has announced the reinstitution of all extant control measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the deadly scourge.\n\nAccordingly, the Presidential Steering Committee PSC on COVID-19 has reimposed the nationwide curfew earlier put in place to control the spread of the virus.\n\nIt has also limited gatherings especially in enclosed spaces to a maximum of 50 persons, urging state governments to inaugurate mobile courts to try offenders.\n\nSpeaking at a media briefing Monday in Abuja, Secretary to the Government of the Federation SGF and Chairman of the PSC, Mr Boss Mustapha said the committee has also considered several pre-emptive measures to be taken to mitigate the likely impact of the variants of concern, should they get imported into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the PSC has produced a new Implementation Guidelines being Phase IV of our Eased restrictions of COVID-19 Lockdown in the Country.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cThis step has become compelling in view of the fragile state of our health systems, the disruption to the vaccines delivery and the lack of compliance with the extant public health measures and social measures contained in the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Health Protection Regulations 2021.\n\n\u201cThe PSC has therefore considered it imperative to re-institute the various public health measures that were put in place under the Health Protection Regulations.\n\n\u201cIn taking this step, the PSC requests the State Governments to please step up to play lead roles in the area of enforcement and sanctions. Similarly, our appeal goes to traditional, religious and community leaders to take up more ownership and responsibility for risk communication and community engagement on the virulent nature of the pandemic, concerns over the variants of concern and the need for compliance\u201d, the SGF stated.\n\nHe added that the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government has fixed the cost of COVID-19 testing, whether PCR or otherwise, at $50 (Fifty US Dollars) at all Points of Entry with effect from 17th May 2021.\n\nThe decision, he said, is to ease travel and trade among citizens of ECOWAS States travelling within the region.\n\nPSC\u2019s Head of Technical Secretariat, Dr Mukhtar Mohammed said persons without facemasks will no longer be allowed into government institutions while it directed security agencies to enforce the use of such masks and other non-pharmaceutical interventions in the transportation sector.\n\nMost government meetings are also now held virtually while only essential international travels are encouraged and that all protocols must be adhered to.\n\nMohammed was however emphatic that there are no restrictions on intra-state travels.\n\n\u201cThe PSC continues to reinforce the surveillance system at the country\u2019s points of entry. While our vaccine rollout has begun, there is a shortage in global supplies affected by the current situation in India. This translates to a delay in vaccinating a large proportion of the population and therefore a risk of a large outbreak especially in the context of poor adherence to the recommended public health and social measures.\n\n\u201cThe level of adherence to the use of facemask, physical distancing, temperature checks in public spaces, handwashing and limits on large gatherings remain very poor. In some areas, these are even nonexistent.\n\n\u201cIn line with the increasing risk of a surge in cases, the PSC is therefore maintaining the enforcement of the COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations. This is to mitigate the risk of a spike in new cases while the nationwide vaccine rollout continues.\n\n\u201cFurther to these recommendations and effective from 0001hours of Tuesday, 11th May 2021, this Phase 4 of the phased restriction of movement shall come into effect. We shall maintain restrictions in mass gatherings outside work settings with a maximum number of 50 people in an enclosed space. Approved gatherings must be held with physical distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. Enforcement of a mandatory requirement of a seven-day quarantine for all international passengers arriving from foreign destinations while institutional quarantine for international passengers arriving from the three countries of India, Brazil and Turkey.\n\n\u201cEnforced temperature checks and no mask, no entry policy in all public settings; workplace buildings, businesses and places of worship etc. Access to Government and commercial premises should be denied to persons without facemasks.\n\n\u201cThe nationwide curfew will be imposed tonight at midnight and it will run through till 4 am. No formal restrictions on movement within the country even as citizens are encouraged to refrain from non-essential movements and comply with all non-pharmaceutical interventions and guidelines. People who are above 60 and or with comorbidities are encouraged to stay at home. Only essential international travels are encouraged\u201d, Mohammed added.\n\nHe said while hotels are to remain open, they should adhere to all non-pharmaceutical interventions while schools are to deploy the use of antigen-based rapid tests as recommended in the guidelines by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control NCDC.\n\nMohammed added that all indoor recreational facilities and gyms are to close until 11th June 2021 when the situation will be reviewed. \u201cHowever, non-contact outdoor sports such as gulf, Polo, tennis etc are not affected\u201d.\n\n\u200bThe PSC said it has received reports of some returning foreign passengers who violated the mandatory quarantine requirement under the advisory by escaping from the facilities.\n\n\u201cWe deprecate such violation of the laws of our land and our hospitality. The PSC is awaiting the report of ongoing investigations and we wish to assure Nigerians that appropriate sanctions would be imposed on the violators\u201d, said Mustapha.\n\nHe said closely associated with the control measures is the issue of vaccine access and administration.\n\nAccording to him, given the challenge of vaccine nationalism compounded by the production situation in India, the PSC is exploring other options to get Nigerians vaccinated.\n\n\u201cAs of date, 1,690,719 persons have received their first dose of the vaccine in Nigeria representing 84% of the targeted persons for this phase. We appeal to States, especially those high burden areas, to push ahead with the vaccination programme\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Bandits are gradually leading the country into a tailspin and the president seems to have been bereft of ideas.\n\n\u201cWhat we experience daily now in Nigeria is enough to set the country on fire; a section of the country lording itself over other sections.\n\nYet they said we shouldn\u2019t talk, that our calls for O\u2019odua Republic were done in bad faith. How can you explain the killings, kidnappings and banditry spreading in North, East, West and South?\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest problems of this government is nepotism. One begins to wonder why Mr. President is insensitive to the plights of others, especially, to the sorrow and agony of citizens losing loved ones to bloodshed. In sane climes, love transcends ethnic, racial or political boundaries. You must blink with pain to see people die or university students being killed amounts to cold-hearted indifference.\n\n\u201cIt is a wakeup call for President Buhari to address all these issues in the interest of this country; else God will not forgive him if Nigeria disintegrates through war,\u201d he said.\n\nAPC has lost the will to secure Nigerians, says PDP treasurer\n\nMeanwhile, speaking at a different forum, the PDP treasurer, Mr. Aribisala said the APC has completely lost the will to ensure the security of lives and property of the citizens.\n\nAribisala spoke at the weekend in Ado-Ekiti, while unveiling his campaign organisation team which has a former chairman of the party in the state, Mr. Bola Olu-Ojo as the Director-General.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, we cannot travel without feeling apprehension of being kidnapped, that\u2019s how bad our security setup is. The president and his team have completely lost it.\n\n\u201cThey lied to Nigerians and we can see the damage they have done to our country across all sectors. There is poverty in the land and there is no hope because the federal government is not doing anything tangible to savage the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we need now are people with good ideology, with quality leadership, who could use their knowledge to revamp the economy, ensure security and bring succor to the people.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Anayo Okoli\n\nOHANAEZE Ndigbo has condemned the shoot-at-sight order given to Nigerian soldiers on Igbo land, warning that the Nigerian government should learn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism.\n\nOhanaeze rather advised the Buhari-led government to \u201cseek possible peaceful options that are the only solution that guarantees national unity and peaceful coexistence\u201d.\n\nOhanaeze lamented that \u201csubnational consciousness or ethnocentric nationalism which is a dangerous form of nationalism to national unity has taken over Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe apex Igbo Socio-cultural body noted that \u201cthe dream of Nigeria unity is receding and fading fast with violence, crises and conflicts\u201d.\n\nIn s statement by its spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia, the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor was quoted as being \u201cunequivocal that the current problems confronting Nigerian, eg ethnic militia, agitation for secession, insurgency, etc are a product of sustained orchestrated injustice in governance\u201d.\n\nAccording to the statement: \u201cThe attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has been drawn to the \u201cShoot at Sight Order\u201d given to the Nigerian soldiers on how to engage the Igbo youths in the oncoming week.\n\n\u201cThe report further revealed that the exercise will commence from Orlu in Imo State, South East Nigeria. This is very disturbing.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of deployment of northern military officers to the South-East lends credence to the above report. It was revealed that in preparation for the above, the Nigerian army has posted Northern Muslims as commanders over its operations and brigades in Anambra, Imo, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Benue, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra State, the Cantonment Commandant of the 302 Artillery Regiment, Onitsha, is Col. Abdulsalam Abubakar Sambo, a Hausa-Fulani Muslim; while in Imo State, the Brigade Commander of 34 Brigade, Obinze, is Brig Gen Ibrahim Tukura, another northerner; in Abia State, the Brigade Commander of 14 Brigade, Ohafia, is Brig Gen M. Ibrahim, still, a northerner; while in Akwa Ibom State, the Brigade Commander of 2 Brigade, Uyo, is Brig Gen Faruk Mijinyawa, another northerner. This is truly worrisome!\n\nREAD ALSO: Troops eliminate 53 bandits including 5 Commanders in Zamfara after clearance Operations\n\n\u201cThe President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Ambassador Prof. George Obiozor, an erudite scholar, seasoned diplomat with diverse experience in governments, has admonished the Nigerian government to \u201clearn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism but seek possible peaceful options that are the only solution that guarantees national unity and peaceful coexistence\u201d.\n\n\u201cObiozor lamented that \u201csubnational consciousness or ethnocentric nationalism which is a dangerous form of nationalism to national unity has taken over Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe dream of Nigeria unity is receding and fading fast with violence, crises and conflicts.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo is unequivocal that the current problems confronting Nigerian, eg ethnic militia, agitation for secession, insurgency, etc are a product of sustained orchestrated injustice in governance. For instance, Senator Shehu Sani, the former senator for Kaduna central, vehemently decried that the Igbo have been systematically marginalised since the civil war.\n\n\u201cSpeaking in Kaduna at a meeting organised by the Association of Eze-Ndigbo in the Diaspora on Saturday, May 8, 2021, Sani described the marginalisation as a collective punishment\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has been a systemic exclusion and marginalisation of your people, stemming from the historical Biafra war. This is a collective punishment\u201d, he declared.\n\n\u201cEvery right-thinking Nigerian, who loves the corporate existence of Nigeria, should align with the Shehu Sani position. The problem with Nigeria in general and the Igbo, in particular, is located in injustice and the simple solution lays in manifest dialogue, equity, and justice.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo warns that Shoot-at- Sight Order to soldiers on Igbo land is a call for another pogrom and genocide.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze asks the Federal Government to refrain from the use of force in resolving the present national crises.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that military and violent means to solve the national question is bound to fail as it leads to further national fractionalization, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration, as in all Empires or multi-national states or countries\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

This was conceived before covid-19.\n\n\u201cNow the joint venture was stalled because of the outbreak \u2013 when there was a lockdown and when nothing could move. So there was a lot of delay by the company in getting themselves on their feet. With the outbreak of Covid-19, all countries were looking forward to vaccine, including Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn our own home, believing that it is possible to easily find a partner to import the technology to produce our own vaccines here, the National Assembly earmarked N10 billion for the production of vaccines.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the aspiration to produce vaccines has not been fulfilled. It is not that it is abandoned; we are working on it and I have spoken with one of the members of the board of management of the bio-vaccine and we are working on getting that technology to both produce routine vaccines and also COVID-19 vaccines under license and importation of the technology and partnership for it.\u201d\n\nDirector General of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, said Nigeria carries out between 30,000 to 40,000 tests weekly, making it closer to the 2,000,000 test target.",

          "text": "\u2022States to set up revenue allocation committees\n\n\u2022New system takes effect 45 days after agreement\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government and governors of the 36 states of the federation have agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nIf the agreement is accepted by judicial and parliamentary workers, who have been on a strike for over one month to press home their demands for financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation, funds from the Federation Account due to each state are to be jointly shared among the executive, legislature and judiciary in each state.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, seeks to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that under the new template, the governors will establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nThe proposal also stipulates that the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) will invoke Executive Order 10 against any state that fails to abide by the terms of the agreement.\n\nA presidency source told THISDAY at the weekend that among the new offers made to the judiciary and legislative workers by the federal and state governments was a reassurance that state governors are committed to implementing full financial autonomy for the two arms of government.\n\n\u201cThey also agreed that they will set up all the structures necessary for the implementation of the financial autonomy, including the budget committee where the judiciaries and state legislatures will forward their expenditure estimates. That will be based on the budget envelope of the projected annual revenue earning for the arms of government as is being done at the federal level,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the source, when the executive, judiciary and legislature prepare their annual budget estimates, they will forward them to the state House of Assembly for consideration and approvals.\n\n\u201cSo when the revenue comes from the federal and the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), the State Fund Allocation Committee will now convene the State Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC), which will now oversee the disbursement of money to different arms of government,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that each state will ensure that it establishes Fund Allocation Committee for its legislature and judiciary to be headed by the head of the courts and the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe two arms of government will also be expected to set up a tenders\u2019 board to be headed by the court registrar and clerk of the state Houses Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the same structure at the federal level would be transposed down to the states.\n\nHe said the same template used by the National Judicial Council (NJC) at the federal level would be adopted in disbursing funds to the judiciary in the states.\n\nHe said under the new arrangement, state Fund Allocation Committee would be headed by the state Commissioner for Finance.\n\nAlso, state Houses of Assembly will be allocated funds in the same manner that the National Assembly receives its allocation after the budget approval.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is a breach on the part of the state government that will trigger off Executive Order 10, which empowers the Accountant-General of the Federation to remit funds directly to the state judicial and legislative arms of government. But if you are doing all that is provided in the proposed template, there will be no need to invoke the Executive Order,\u201d he said.\n\nThe striking judicial and legislative workers had earlier vowed not to compromise on their demands for the implementation of 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThe workers said last week at a meeting with a federal government team, led by Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that the issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries was a constitutional provision that did not warrant any negotiation with governors.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN had also insisted that the governors must fully implement financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation as guaranteed by the constitution before the strike would be called off.\n\nThe federal government had also pleaded with the unions to consider the efforts being made to resolve the dispute and suspend their strike to enable the court and legislatures to reopen.\n\nNgige had said last week that progress had been made in about 90 per cent of the issues in dispute.\n\nHowever, the meeting between the federal government team and the leadership of the unions had ended with an agreement that the unions should go and study the government\u2019s proposal before the next meeting, billed for tomorrow.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal yesterday indicated that it is considering extending the current equalisation scheme in the petrol supply system in the country to the movement of gas across the country to make the product more available and accessible to Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during an interactive session with energy correspondents in Abuja, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) Management Board, Mr Ahmed Bobboi, noted that when the policy becomes functional, it will help tackle inflation associated with increases in gas products.\n\nPEF\u2019s main function is to ensure price uniformity of petroleum products via the reimbursement of marketers for trucking products to filling stations anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nThe executive secretary stated that the scheme had yet to fully take off because the government was still propagating the use of gas as an alternative fuel and was yet to get its full adoption by the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that 2021 to 2030 had been declared as the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, explaining that a lot of consultations were still ongoing with all relevant agencies to make the proposal become a reality.\n\nBobboi stated that the policy was also awaiting the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) which will clearly spell out the new functions of the PEF, stressing that whatever role is assigned the petrol equalisation board will determine the next line of action on the proposed scheme.\n\n\u201cThis is the (equalisation) scheme that we are trying to extend to gas because the government has declared the decade of gas and we have seen that this has been working for the economy for over 45 years effectively.\n\n\u201cBecause things are much better and if you want to see the benefits, then look at it that in the absence of this scheme what happens to other commodities, the economy, to inflation and then many businesses would have been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s working well for petrol and government wants to promote the use of gas, if we can take the practice to gas, we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain,\u201d Bobboi argued.\n\nHe maintained that when the government extends the practice to the gas sector, it will help many Nigerian homes abandon the use of firewood and reduce deforestation.\n\nAccording to him, it will also eliminate the health hazards associated with the use of high carbon fuels like firewood, especially in rural and remote areas.\n\n\u201cThis will make the product available because we have a lot of gas in the country, it will make it affordable which will incentivise the marketers to take it to the last mile, the consumer will also be incentivised because the marketer will bring down his price. This will do a lot of good to the economy. This is our view,\u201d he noted.\n\nBobboi who took time to break down the continuing relevance of the petrol equalisation fund noted that government was not paying a dime in ensuring parity of petrol price in the country, adding that the consumer pays for it.\n\nThe executive secretary emphasised that \u201cbridging\u201d had become even more relevant because most of the pipelines that were supposed to take the products to many parts of the country had been vandalised.\n\nHe stressed that the original reason for the bridging the policy was to act as a buffer on consumers during turn-around-maintenance, adding that even the existing depots have not been functioning properly.\n\n\u201cThe pipelines have been vandalised, now instead of 30 per cent maximum bridging, it is now about 100 per cent. The cheapest we can have is 98 to 99 per cent because the movement through the pipelines is very low,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Muhammadu Buhari yesterday bemoaned the killings in the country that have worsened the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, condoled with the relatives of those who lost their lives in what he called madness going on nationwide.\n\nThe killings continued at the weekend as bandits murdered no fewer than 11 persons in Katsina and Kaduna States.\n\nAlso, gunmen sustained their attacks on police facilities in the South-east as they hit a police station in Umuahia, Abia State capital.\n\nBuhari, who called for a low-key Eid al-Fitr celebration as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic said: \u201cAs Muslims in Nigeria join others globally in preparations towards Eid al-Fitr, a day that is celebrated to mark the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, President Buhari has directed that all celebrations are limited due to the global Coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the president, first family, his personal aides, members of the cabinet and service chiefs who choose to remain in Abuja will congregate in full compliance with COVID-19 protocols at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, Abuja to observe the Eid prayers by 9:00 am.\n\n\u201cThereafter, there will be no traditional Sallah homage to the president by religious, community and political leaders\n\nas was the case last year, the president encouraged such leaders to be content with modest celebrations at home in view of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Islamic clerics and other religious leaders who continue to pray for the wellbeing of the nation and its people.\n\nThe president called on all local leaders to talk to their youths and warn them against being used to incite and foment violence, saying that \u201cif we attack institutions guarding us, who will protect us in future emergencies?\u201d\n\nBandits Kill 11, Injure Three in Kaduna, Katsina\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 11 persons were confirmed killed while three others were injured by bandits in a fresh reprisal by suspected bandits at Tsatskiya community in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State and another separate attack by gunmen in Kaduna.\n\nA retired army sergeant, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed in the Kaduna incident.\n\nThe bandits who attacked Katsina community on Saturday were believed to be avenging a mob action against two of the bandits\u2019 informants who were reportedly killed by some people in the community.\n\nThe bandits, who were said to have invaded the community in the afternoon, also wounded three others who are currently receiving treatment at a Dutsinma town hospital.\n\nResidents confirmed that the bandits were on a reprisal over the recent killing of their informants.\n\nOne of the informants was said to have been killed four days ago in a nearby community called Hakon Kartakawa.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the incident yesterday.\n\n\u201cDuring the attack, two people were equally wounded and are still receiving medical attention at Dutsinma General Hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the attack, the residents of Tsatskiya community and other neighbouring villages fled the village to Dutsinma town for safety.\n\nIn another incident, a retired army sergeant, Christopher Madaki, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed by bandits following an attack on Golkofa community, Jama\u2019a Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, his son, Mr. Clement Madaki, was only injured.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, confirmed the killings in a statement yesterday in Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the killings took place on Saturday night when bandits invaded the community.\n\nThe commissioner also said a breakdown of law and order was averted in Kachia town, headquarters of Kachia LGA following the alleged killing of one Hamidu Nura by one Abba Muhammad.\n\nAruwan said the killings in Golkofa were reported to the state government by the Kaduna State Police Command and the Defence Headquarters outfit \u201cOperation Safe Haven.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, gunmen attacked a police station, named after a former Inspector-General (IG), Mr. Mike Okiro, in Umuahia.\n\nThe news of the attack caused pandemonium in the town as churches abruptly ended their services to enable worshippers flee to safety.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state command, Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the incident while speaking with THISDAY on phone.\n\nHe said the attack occurred at 9.45 am, adding that the attackers came in a bus and two Sienna SUVs.\n\nHe stated that a police officer was shot and wounded in the leg during the attack.\n\nAccording to the PPRO, the building was not burnt as the roof did not catch fire when torched.\n\nHowever, he said the hoodlums invaded the offices and gathered files, documents and furniture and set them ablaze. Also, two vehicles and two motorcycles on the premises were burnt.\n\nThe attack on the Mike Okiro Police Station was the first such incident in Umuahia although no fewer than four police stations have been razed in the state this year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) says it is investigating \u201cpossible violation of patient and consumer rights\u201d in the deaths of Peju Ugboma, a popular pastry chef, and Omolara Omoyajowo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission broke the news in a statement by Babatunde Irukera, its chief executive officer, on Monday.\n\nPeju\u2019s family had earlier alleged that their daughter died due to negligence of health officials at Premier Specialist Medical Centre in Victoria Island where she had surgery for fibroid.\n\nOmolara was also said to have died due to alleged negligence by officials at the Beachland Specialist Hospital in Arepo axis of Ogun state where she received treatment after suffering an ulcer attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demise of the pair had provoked outrage on social media, with many Nigerians calling on relevant authorities to investigate the incidents and ensure those found guilty are brought to book.\n\nIn the statement, FCCPC said the information gathered so far was enough for the commission to open an active investigation into the two cases.\n\nThe commission also disclosed that it has already issued \u201cNotices of Commencement of Investigation and Summons to Produce (NCISP) to relevant persons and entities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt added that it is also collaborating with the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) in the investigation to determine the extent of possible violation in the cases.\n\n\u201cIn both cases, relatives and friends allege mismanagement including failure of professional standards; as well as patient care/customer service standards including timely responses to requests,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe commission in 2018, in collaboration with multiple healthcare professional associations led by the Nigerian Medical Association, and the Federal Ministry of Health promoted, created, and secured the adoption of the Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights (PBoR). The rights enshrined therein are provider obligations that otherwise exist in other enforceable instruments/codes governing healthcare delivery.\n\n\u201cFurther, and in addition, the Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA) mandates the Commission to enforce \u201cany enactment with respect to the protection of consumers, conduct investigations into matters related to consumer protection; ensure consumer interests receive due consideration, and provide redress to obnoxious practices; ensure service providers comply with local and international standards of safe service delivery\u201d Section 17(a), (e), (s) and (y).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe commission does not investigate or evaluate conduct to determine professionalism, ethics or violation of professional/ethical codes. The Commission does not make determinations with respect to the professionalism or adopted procedures of qualified and authorised professionals.\n\n\u201cHowever, the commission investigates and considers whether service providers sufficiently respect rights of consumers and applicable standards of care in compliance with those rights, including providing redress or remedies for injured consumers.\n\n\u201cInitial information gathered is sufficient for the Commission to open an active investigation into these cases. As such, the Commission has today issued Notices of Commencement of Investigation & Summons to Produce (NCISP) to relevant persons/entities.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is also communicating with the Medical & Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), to expand engagement to the extent that any pertinent conduct may be otherwise unprofessional and, or may be subject of any disciplinary process (if applicable).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission called on the public to provide useful information to aid the investigation with a view to getting justice.\n\n\u201cFinally, considering the sensitivity of these sad events, and in respect and deference to families/affected persons or reputation of both professionals and facilities, the commission advises candor and restraint in discussions and pronouncements about the occurrence and investigation,\u201d it added.\n\nThe development comes hours after the Lagos state government also ordered a probe into the circumstances that led to Peju\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "SpaceX, an American private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, is seeking necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its internet service into Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by Ryan Goodnight, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, in a meeting with Nigerian Communications Commission\u2019s (NCC) Executive Vice-Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, last Friday in Abuja.\n\nFrom L \u2013 R: Consultant to SpaceX, Levin Born; Director, Spectrum Administration, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Oluwatoyin Asaju; Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska; SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight and Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, during the SpaceX\u2019s presentation to the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Goodnight, Nigeria has been identified as a critical market in Africa. Before the face-to-face meeting happened last week, SpaceX had been discussing with the NCC virtually over the past several months.\n\nAbout Starlink\n\nIn 2002, Elon Musk founded SpaceX to revolutionize space technology and reduce space transportation costs. In 2020, the company expanded its efforts to provide satellite internet service: they called the product Starlink. As of March 2021, Starlink had more than 1,100 satellites in space.\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas.\n\nIt is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nCost and Competitors\n\nStarlink is currently in beta, meaning not everyone can sign up. Its beta service comes with a price tag of $99 (~\u20a640,000) per month. There\u2019s also a $499 (~\u20a6200,000) upfront cost to cover the Starlink kit, which includes all of the necessary hardware: a small satellite dish, a router, power supply, and mounting tripod.\n\nCredit: SpaceX\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these rates are just for beta customers. Prices could change when the service becomes more readily available.\n\nAccording to the company, over 10,000 customers currently have access to Starlink, with over 500,000 orders. It plans to expand into many service areas later in 2021.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink appears to be a more expensive option, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nWith the Nigerian government\u2019s plan to bring in 90% of its population online by 2025, it\u2019ll be open to multiple avenues to bring this to reality. There are already a number of internet initiatives such as Facebook\u2019s 2Africa, a $1 billion undersea internet cable for faster internet in Africa and Google and Econet\u2019s partnership.\n\nStarlink\u2019s presence in Nigeria is exciting, but as we\u2019ve seen from the Google Loon project, which was abandoned earlier this year, time will tell if it succeeds.",

          "text": "I\u2019m bringing Blessing Abeng to centre stage because I am inspired by her dedication to supporting Africa\u2019s rising tech talent through her role as Director of Communications at Ingressive For Good. Blessing is a go-getter who is eager to learn and isn\u2019t afraid to ask questions or have difficult conversations. I admire Blessing\u2019s courage and commitment to keep going despite the occasional obstacles life has thrown at her.\n\nBusy schedules, French verbs, and healthy work habits\n\nYou seem like a busy woman. What does a typical day look like for you?\n\nI think that\u2019s one of the hardest questions to answer. You know how lots of successful people recommend having and sticking to a routine because it helps you plan your life and whatnot? Yeah, that has never really worked for me.\n\nHaha! Really?\n\nYup! When you work in communication, no two days are the same. Some days I don\u2019t sleep. Some days I sleep and wake up at 6 am. And some days I sleep in [laughs]. So the way I plan my day is dependent on my goals and objectives. There\u2019s also the fact that I am taking French classes at the moment.\n\nPause. Tell me why you are learning French?\n\nPlease don\u2019t laugh. I want to be able to dream and think in another language that isn\u2019t English. Learning a different language opens your mind up to a myriad of possibilities and expands the way you think. Learning French has shown me that people think differently based on their first or second language.\n\nVery interesting. Where are you taking classes and how does learning French affect your day-to-day work?\n\nI\u2019m taking a 360 approach to learning French. I\u2019m taking some lessons at Alliance Francaise de Lagos \u2013 which means I\u2019m up early at 5:30 AM to plan and kick off my day before classes start at 8 AM. I also use Duolingo and practice my speaking with online videos and courses.\n\nWow. And you do this every day?\n\nEvery single day. Sometimes during class, I am on my laptop responding to emails and doing some work. As you can imagine, my French teacher teases me a lot about overworking myself. I know the way I work, for the most part, isn\u2019t healthy, and I\u2019m learning that I cannot work like this and survive.\n\nCommunication skills, learning on the job and killing myths:\n\nSpeaking of jobs, what existing skillsets did you have before you joined Ingressive?\n\nI\u2019ve always had great leadership and digital marketing skills. I know my way around offline and online marketing tactics. I\u2019m great at storytelling and one of my strengths is creating and executing strategic plans.\n\nWhat did you learn on the job?\n\nI learned how to communicate with donors. Ingressive for Good is a non-profit company, so managing donors is a different ball game. I had to learn how to speak to donors and effectively communicate what we are doing at Ingressive. I also learned how to better manage my time and allocate my minutes and hours to my job, team members, and family members. The higher you go, the more work you have to do. I had to learn how to prioritize my time effectively.\n\nWhat are some myths you think it\u2019s important to kill?\n\nDon\u2019t just do the work \u2013 show the work. What does that mean? Well, I\u2019ve met people who believe that all they need to do is build a product and their customers will find it. That\u2019s not how things work. If you only do the work, and it doesn\u2019t get in front of the people who need it, you might not grow as fast as you want to. I recommend that founders prioritize showing the work as much as doing the work. If you aren\u2019t capable of doing it yourself, hire a comms person to do it.\n\nWhat skills should aspiring communications professionals be learning?\n\nPresentation skills. Presentation is important because as you grow you\u2019re going to have to start presenting to boards, senior leaders and executives. You need to be able to capture what\u2019s important without boring them.\n\nI also recommend that they should dedicate themselves to learning and assimilating ideas and best practices that are relevant to the industry. And don\u2019t just learn; go out and put into practice what you\u2019ve been taught online or in-person.\n\nHow do you define and navigate professional failures?\n\nFirstly, I remind myself that failing at a project does not mean I am a failure. I have only failed when I stop trying or I think, \u201cI have failed so let me give up.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s a place to exit projects that aren\u2019t working the way you want them to; but I don\u2019t allow failure to kick me down or make me lose my confidence or hope in life.\n\nSecondly, failing at a project does not mean you are not excellent. Failure gives you an opportunity to take stock and figure out what went wrong and what could have been done differently.\n\nThirdly, take your time to process the failure but don\u2019t dwell on it. I also recommend keeping track of your wins and successes. I have a \u201cwin journal\u201d and it helps me remember my accomplishments.\n\nThe intersection of family and work:\n\nMy dad wanted me to be a doctor. Obviously, that didn\u2019t happen. Back in the day, my mother used to get teased about having two daughters. Her co-workers would tell her, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a child yet because you don\u2019t have a son.\u201d\n\nWhat?\n\nYes! She used to cry about it and quite frankly, I stand by the fact that she was bullied at work. She didn\u2019t let it affect the way she raised us though. She simply encouraged us to work harder and prove to naysayers that gender isn\u2019t the ultimate marker for success in our society.\n\nSo you didn\u2019t go down the medicine path. How did you find your way to branding?\n\nA friend of mine recommended that I go to branding school and turn my creativity into a professional career path. I told my dad I was leaving Abuja and moving to Lagos to learn brand management and work in an agency. Even though he wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it, he still supported me. We signed an agreement: if my chosen path didn\u2019t work out after two years, I had to come back home.\n\nTrends, insights, and the future of business and tech in Africa:\n\nWhen you think about the tech and business ecosystem in Africa, what excites you? What do you think is possible?\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t know the future and I cannot predict that any of my thoughts will be fulfilled at some point in this life.\n\nDr Ola Brown once explained that small businesses are the lifeblood of a country. SMEs help with employability and boosting the economy \u2013 which means that we need to see more support for SMEs so they can hire our growing youth population. I believe that there is hope for our employment issues to be solved in the future because of the amount of funding coming into the country. I also see that an increasing number of small businesses are going out of their way to solve problems that our leaders have ignored for too long.\n\nI\u2019m also excited about the startups that are making bold moves. I applaud businesses like Flutterwave, Bankly and Paystack for going over and beyond to change the narrative about innovation and entrepreneurship in Nigeria.",

That is also how those in the credit business make money. It would seem then that insurers can learn some tricks from credit businesses to know what levers to pull for insurance to be more appealing and adopted by customers.\n\nA lot of the buzz about digital lending is in using data to provide tailored customer products and services. If well deployed, big data and analysis could be the pillar that boosts insurance in Africa, activating a market potential estimated to be up to $68 billion by McKinsey.\n\n\n\nThe investor and startup communities seem to think this future is achievable, a signal that we could yet see more investments into the insurance sector in the latter months of 2021.",

          "text": "Following its official launch, the new Learn at Home audio e-learning platform will provide free, online, and unlimited learning access to more than 100 million Nigerian youths.\n\nThis first-of-its-kind audio e-learning platform will offer unlimited access based on the national mobile phone penetration, low-data, and basic featurephone requirements. The platform is a continuum of Data Science Nigeria\u2019s successful \u2018LearnatHome\u2019 initiative, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, that provided learning to millions of Nigerian pupils amid the COVID-19 disruptive restrictions. Learn at Home is based on an inclusive e-learning approach. It is designed to eliminate the barriers of internet access (data) cost and over-dependency on expensive smartphones in the delivery of locally relevant, convenient, and inexpensive access to quality education.\n\nThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative, www.learnathome.radio is part of an extensive effort to reduce the urban-rural learning disparities in Nigeria.\n\nMastercard Foundation says it is a continuation of efforts to ensure universal learning and improve learning outcomes across all communities in Nigeria. Already, more than 4 million students have joined audio classes with USSD/SMS support, where they receive educational materials on key subjects, based on the Nigerian Educational Research and Development (NERDC) curriculum for primary and secondary school students. \u201cThe disruption of the pandemic did not only halt learning for many, but also revealed and exacerbated existing inequalities in learning opportunities. The purpose of www.learnathome.radio is to ensure children have equal, convenient, and affordable access to quality learning,\u201d said, Chidinma Lawanson, Country Head, Mastercard Foundation Nigeria.\n\nOn the platform, pupils and students from primary 1 to Senior Secondary (SS3) will gain access to a special examination readiness series that includes a collection of solved past questions in WAEC, NECO, BECE, and Common Entrance from 2009 to 2020. Expert teachers have been engaged to provide answers and explanations to the past questions in a step-by-step and easy-to-understand format, with complementary live classes that enable each student to learn at a preferred pace irrespective of location and socioeconomic conditions.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, Toyin Adekanmbi, the Executive Director of Data Science Nigeria, described it as \u201ca creative and innovative approach to democratize learning in Nigeria and provide an effective solution to the challenge of unequal distribution of learning and education opportunities in rural and urban communities.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative will build on the clear successes we recorded in the quest to ensure ongoing learning for children during the pandemic restrictions, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, through our audio classes in several cities in Nigeria. It is specifically designed for smooth functionality on basic feature phones operating on the EDGE or 2G network and low data. For MTN users, it is absolutely free. With this, children in rural and remote communities can learn from the highest quality teachers at their own pace and prepare for important examinations with the best resources and educational aids developed based on the approved curriculum.\u201d\n\nBesides the examination preparation series, www.learnathome.radio features a wide variety of content, including amazing global facts, inspirational quotes, current affairs, common errors in the English language, and much more. Mr. Nwachukwu, one of the parents, already taking advantage of the platform, praised it as a breakthrough innovation. \u201cBefore, platforms like this one, were usually only for those who could afford expensive laptops or smartphones and daily internet subscriptions. Now, every child, everywhere can learn.\u201d\n\nAbout Data Science Nigeria\n\nData Science Nigeria is a registered non-profit organization, run and managed by the Data Scientists Network Foundation, with a vision to build a world-class Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, research and innovation ecosystem that delivers high-impact transformational research, business use applications, AI-first start-ups, support employability and social good use cases. We are poised to accelerate Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic development through a solution-oriented application of machine learning in solving social/business problems. Data Science Nigeria (DSN) non-profit has been in the forefront of data and data science skills acquisition in Nigeria.\n\nDSN runs a broad-based capacity intervention across Nigeria with broader beneficiary base through its free trainings (kids, pre-university students, professionals and business executives across states in Nigeria). These initiatives are in line with Data Science Nigeria\u2019s vision and commitment to raising one million AI talents in 10 years and thus position Nigeria as one of the top 10 AI talent/knowledge destinations with 20% GDP multiplier impact.\n\nAbout the Mastercard Foundation\n\nThe Mastercard Foundation works with visionary organizations to enable young people in Africa and in Indigenous communities in Canada to access dignified and fulfilling work. It is one of the largest, private foundations in the world with a mission to advance learning and promote financial inclusion to create an inclusive and equitable world. The Foundation was created by Mastercard in 2006 as an independent organization with its own Board of Directors and management.\n\nFor more information on the Foundation, please visit: www.mastercardfdn.org",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNdigbo Lagos, an umbrella body of Igbo people in Lagos, has dismissed as mischievous, claims by the Special Adviser to Lagos State Government on Drainage and Water Resources, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, that some \u201cIgbo\u201d youths suspected to IPOB members, were planning to attack police stations and other public facilities in Lagos.\n\nThe group\u2019s Director of Communication and Strategy, Prince Tony Eze, in a statement on Monday, described Mr. Igbokwe\u2019s claims as not only false, but also inciting and very unfortunate.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe at Ndigbo Lagos have just listened to the video making the rounds in the Social Media today 9th May 2021. In the said video Mr. Joe Igbokwe, a Political appointee of Lagos State Government and Special Adviser Drainage and Water Resources claimed insider knowledge of a clandestine plot by some Igbo youths who he believes are IPOB members, to kill, to burn down police stations and public infrastructure in Lagos.\n\n\u201cNDIGBO LAGOS the umbrella body of all Igbo organizations in Lagos, wish to state as follows:\n\n1. That we are saddened by the claims of Mr. Igbokwe, which we believe are mischievous, false, baseless and inciting.\n\n2. That the governments of the South Eastern States of Nigeria and various security agencies in the country have initiated investigations to unravel the persons behind the killings and destruction of properties in the South East, and we believe strongly in their competence and ability to unravel the masterminds and bring them to justice.\n\n3. That as usual with such serious investigations the Police and other Security Agencies expect support through information from responsible citizens of which Joe Igbokwe being a government insider is very much aware of and in a good position to comply with.\n\n4. That rather than do this, Mr. Igbokwe irresponsibly went to town with his personal conclusions on who these perpetrators are and what evil they are planning for Lagos, notwithstanding the ongoing official investigations. This probably goes to suggest that Mr. Igbokwe knows more than the ordinary eyes could see, and should be invited by the relevant security agency to clarify his source which he claims is credible.\n\n5. That the Lagos State government had initiated and conducted investigation on what happened during the EndSars protest, and are well equipped with relevant information on the perpetrators of that heinous act.\n\n6. That the Igbos were not the cause of the Biafran war, and have no intention to engage into any acts as may suggest any intention of such in the foregoing circumstance.\n\n7. That we condemn in clear terms the killings going on all over the country, including in the South East, and sympathize with the families of officers and civilians, who have had to endure the loss of their dear ones. We pray their soul to rest perfect in the bossom of our Lord!\n\n8. We wish to reiterate that Igbo youths are NOT killers, neither are they arsonists, but are positively recognized as hardworking contributors to the development of our country. We have been victims rather than perpetrators of killings, burnings and looting in Nigeria.\n\n9. That it has become expedient for us to issue this rebuttal, in the light of the hightened tension in the country, being convinced that some malevolent minds may take advantage of Mr. Joe Igbokwe\u2019s recklessness with unsubstantiated rethorics to spread mistrust, cause disunity and escalate mischief in such manner and disguise, as may cause fingers to be wrongly pointed at the Igbos in Lagos. We therefore call on Mr. Joe Igbokwe to desist from reaching hasty conclusions, and spreading of falsehood.\n\n10. We enjoin Ndigbo across Lagos to go about their normal buisness. And should not engage in any unlawful acts that would endanger the good relationship we enjoy with the people of Lagos State.\n\n11. Finally, we want to remind Mr. Igbokwe that respect for the elderly is one of the cornerstone of Igbo values and civilized behavior. Hence, we call upon him to retrace his steps and apologize to Chief Mbazulike Amechi for the unconscionable remarks he made against him.\u201d",

This contribution is about 6.1% of the GDP of Nigeria and eleven times the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for 2019.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 it is estimated that the Diaspora Home Remittances to Nigeria stood at about $20 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that the Federal Government has taken some strategic initiatives to exploit the immense potentials of Nigerians in Diaspora, which included the establishment of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM); National Diaspora Policy; Constitution of Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Diaspora Affairs, building and strengthening ties with the Diaspora; Diaspora Voting; National Diaspora Day Celebration, and Establishment of the State Diaspora Focal Point Officers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister said the outcome of the the initiatives has led to the numerous contributions from Diaspora on health, education, sports, entertainment, ICT and griculture.\n\nDada, therefore, urged Nigerians in the Diaspora not to be discouraged by the challenges facing the nation such as insecurity, infrastructure deficits and poor investment, but to join hands with the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to fix the problems.\n\nAlso speaking during the webinar, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, assured Nigerians both home and in the Diaspora that the far-reaching reforms embarked upon by the Ministry and its agencies particularly the Nigerian Immigrations Service (NIS), will resolve some of the difficulties they encounter in processing their passports.\n\nHe said government has established Front Offices in some selected airports in Nigeria and promised that the issue of backlog of passports will be resolved by May 31, adding that the shortage of passports will be adequately resolved very soon.\n\nHe noted that all passport applications will be made online and the processing will take two weeks, stressing that applicants will be informed via emails even as the affiliates which have passport support centers will assist in this regard.\n\nAlso speaking, the chaiman/CEO of NIDCOM, Hon.

          "text": "Two ex-students of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok in Borno state, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu, who escaped from Boko Haram militants in 2014, have graduated from Southeastern University in the United States.\n\nBishara and Pogu were among the 276 girls first kidnapped by the insurgent group on April 14, 2014.\n\nThe duo managed to escape captivity by jumping off the truck while they were being taken away by the kidnappers.\n\nBishara bagged a degree in social work, while Pogu earned a degree in legal studies; both graduated on April 30.\n\nREAD ALSO: Eid-Al-Fitr: FG declares Wednesday, Thursday public holidays\n\nCommenting on their ordeal and success, Bishara recalled how in a few seconds, she had to decide if she was going to die from an accident or in the hands of the insurgents.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking about what my mum would do at that moment then I prayed. I just remembered a voice in my head saying \u2018jump out\u2019. I knew I was going to die either way. I chose to die and that was how I jumped out,\u201d Bishara told GMA3.\n\nAsked how she felt on the day of her graduation, she said: \u201cIt was awesome, I felt great. I remember being told that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to finish high school; that I was dumb. I never gave up or listened to all the negative talks.\n\nIt was exciting to walk on that stage after being told \u2018you can\u2019t do it\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to walk on that stage after being told you can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Pogu said she had decided against going back to school after her escape until she was contacted by the US embassy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get my master\u2019s in human services and going back to law school when I\u2019m done with my master\u2019s,\u201d Pogu said.\n\nBoth girls had graduated from Canyonville Christian Academy in Oregon in February 2017, after which they met with ex-President Donald Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, 112 of the Chibok girls are still in Boko Haram captivity.",

          "text": "By Tom Okpe\n\nMinority Caucus in the House of Representatives is alarmed by the alleged looting of over N165 billion operating surplus as well as other diverted funds running into billions of naira, by top officials of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), calling for the nations\u2019 anti-graft body to investigate the Organization.\n\nThe lawmakers described as \u2018another sad commentary on the brimming corruption in the APC administration,\u2019 mindless lootings of such stupendous resources at a time the country was writhing in the throes of worsening insecurity.\n\nIt, therefore asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to immediately take in the indicted Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, and commence a system-wide investigation with a view to prosecuting her, if found wanting.\n\nThe Caucus in a statement signed by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu (PDP Delta) on Monday, insisted that such huge economic crime against the nation should not be left to an administrative panel of enquiry, but committed to an anti-graft agency for independent investigation.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers expressed concern that by committing the alleged NPA looting to an administrative panel, political manipulations and partisan influences had taken precedence over what should have been a system-wide investigation into a monumental fraud.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the recourse to an administrative, instead of a full-scale criminal investigation can nly serve as decoy to shield some other APC government officials involved in the looting spree at NPA and other affiliated agencies in the transport sector.\n\n\u201cApart from the unremitted N165 billion cited by the Minister, other documents and reports from the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation had also uncovered several sleaze, including unremitted deduction to Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) amounting to N3,667,750,470. $148,845,745.04, Euro 4,891,449.50 and \u00a3252,682.14.\n\n\u201cOur Caucus holds that the mere suspension of the indicted Managing Director of the NPA, Hadiza Bala Usman, and the resort to an administrative panel of enquiry even after the report by the Supervising Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, exposed an unremitted and possibly diverted operating surplus of N165 billion, amounts to romancing and perfuming corruption by the APC-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to audit query of N15.18 billion allegedly stolen through inflated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects/programmes under the watch of the suspended NPA Managing Director.\n\nREAD ALSO: Eddie Hearn confirms Anthony Joshua vs Tyson Fury will be announced this week\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the suffering people of Nigeria, our Caucus is particularly very worried that such monumental lootings are going on at a time terrorists, bandits, unknown gunmen, and criminal militias are reigning supreme across the length and breath of the country and life has consequently become the cheapest article in the country.\n\n\u201cWe imagine that such resources if channelled to the security sector and well managed would have made a world of difference in addressing the problem of insecurity in the country,\u201d the caucus stated.\n\nIt further stressed that the APC administration had crippled the national economy and brought untold hardship and suffering to Nigerians, therefore demanded more drastic step by anti-graft agencies to recover the stolen funds as well as prosecute all, involved in the looting spree.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that a party that came to power with the promise of fighting corruption, build the economy, and fight insecurity has ended up destroying whatever gains that were made before it came to power.\u201d",

The Resident Electoral Commissioner for the State, Dr. Joseph Iloh, reported that INEC\u2019s recently renovated office in Ohafia Local Government Area has been set ablaze.\n\n\u201cThe incident occurred late on Sunday night, 9th May 2021. There are no casualties on the part of our staff on guard duty but the building was virtually destroyed. Apart from furniture items, all electoral materials and office equipment were destroyed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe matter has been reported to the police for investigation.\n\n\u201cIt will be recalled that only last week, the Commission reported an attack on its office in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and expressed anxiety about the impact of such attacks on electoral activities, including the ongoing expansion of voter access to Polling Units, resumption of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), pending bye-elections, end-of-tenure elections and ultimately the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cThe latest incident in Abia State is one too many. This is not the first attack on the Commission\u2019s facilities in the State in recent times. Five months ago on 13th December 2020, the INEC LGA office in Aba South was completely burnt down while that of Arochukwu LGA was vandalised and ransacked in October 2020.\n\n\u201cThese facilities are national assets, which must be protected. Accordingly, the Commission is convening an emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) next week to discuss this disturbing trend.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Commission wishes to reassure Nigerians that all activities in relation to the ongoing expansion of voter access to Polling Units and preparations for the resumption of CVR as well as all scheduled elections will proceed as planned.\u201d",
