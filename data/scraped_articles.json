I got to her parlour and met a lot of people as usual, but she told me to move into the room.\n\n\u201cWe spoke for long and even cracked jokes. I am driving to the burial ground no matter how late because even in death, I respect her.\u201d\n\nThe state governor, Darius Ishaku, who also spoke while receiving a delegation from Adamawa State, said his relationship with the deceased defied political leaning.\n\nAlso read :\n\nHe recalled that after the 2019 elections, Alhassan who contested against him told him she was ready to work with him in the interest of the people of Taraba.\n\nThis he explained she (Alhassan) remained committed until her death.\n\nThe delegation from Adamawa, led by the state Commissioner for Works, Adamu Atiku-Abubakar, noted that Taraba had indeed lost an icon.\n\nThe Presidency also sent a delegation to the state Tuesday led by the Minister of State Works, Abubakar Aliyu, and accompanied by Minister of State, Science and Technology, Mohammed Abdullahi, and Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu.\n\nThe state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, also bid farewell to the ex-minister who in 2019 moved to the party.\n\nThe party through its Publicity Secretary, Andeta\u2019rang Irammae, described her death as a monumental loss not only to her immediate family but the country at large.\n\nHe said, \u201cSenator Aisha Jummai Alhassan, an accomplished civil servant, political icon and a grassroots mobilizer, was a founding member of the party in Taraba State.\n\n\u201cHer return to the party after the last elections boosted our standing in the political space and affirmed her love for the party.\n\n\u201cWe recall with nostalgia her roles and commitment when she served as the Chairperson of PDP Assessment Committee in Taraba North Senatorial District recently and turned in a report that has greatly strengthen the party\u2019s cohesiveness in the state. \u201cSenator Aisha strongly believed in the institutionalization of the PDP not just in Taraba State, but also in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHer loss is monumental to not just the Pa Alh.

Virtually every community in the senatorial district is feeling the impact of Omo-Agege.\n\nOmo-Agege, who was elected into the Senate in 2015, has proved himself to be a true voice of the people of Delta Central compared to what the people had from the inception until 2015.\n\nHe influenced the establishment of a Federal Polytechnic in Orogun, Defence Space School, Orogun, 45 transformers, 700 stands of street lights and renovation/rehabilitation of a good number of secondary schools across the senatorial district.\n\nThe senator has also influenced the repair/rehabilitation of failed portions of Warri-Abraka road, furnishing of primary and secondary schools in Ughelli North and Ughelli South, Ethiope East and Ethiope West, Okpe and Uvwie, Udu and Sapele Local Government Areas.\n\nAlso read:\n\nOmo-Agege also gave motorcycles to constituents in Ethiope East and Ughelli North while some got tricycles in Uvwie and Ughelli. He also gave out grinding machines to constituents in Ughelli North.\n\nAlso to his credit are the construction of 50,000 Gallons Braithwaite Steel Tank with Solar Powered Water Supply Scheme completed with Pipeline Network in Oghara-Eki, Ethiope West; construction of 50,000 Gallons Braithwaite Steel Tank with Solar Powered Water Supply Scheme completed with Pipeline Network in Adeje and Okpe LGAs.\n\nA few days ago, he attracted the construction of a Niger Delta Power Holding Company, NDPHC, distribution substation to Orogun.\n\nOmo-Agege, who spoke during the groundbreaking ceremony of the construction of the substation, expressed appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the project for the community and the environs.\n\nHe held that the groundbreaking ceremony \u201csignposts the near end of energy crisis and energy poverty that we have witnessed in this clime with a negative impact on the livelihood of the people and the economy of the area\u201d, saying he had no doubt that the establishment of the substation would promote research and development of the Federal Polytechnic, Orogun.\n\nWhile noting that the Buhari administration was currently making significant efforts aimed at reducing the energy deficit \u201cthat has over the years impacted negatively on economic development and public health\u201d, he said, \u201cThe objective has been to ensure that the number of people who use modern energy should increase to reduce social costs and to increase social benefits.\n\n\u201cThe establishment of this power substation is one of the several initiatives of this administration aimed at addressing the energy poverty in our nation.\n\n\u201cEarlier, we have leveraged on the vision of this administration in this sector to provide transformers for several communities in our senatorial district to improve the energy availability and supply in their areas.\n\n\u201cWe have already provided solar-powered streetlights across most communities in Delta Central. We are looking forward to doing more once the implementation of the 2021 budget begins.\u201d\n\nEmphasizing that substations play a critical role in the power industry, Omo-Agege noted that \u201cSubstations support the transmission grid in moving power from generation sources to customers\u2019 load, while electrical utilities use them for system protection, switching capabilities and more importantly, voltage transformations.\n\n\u201cIt is thus my hope that the construction of the power substation will boost access to energy in the region and consequently bring about enhanced economic activities and poverty reduction through enhanced income, health, education and improved environment\u201d.\n\nHe called on the Benin Electricity Distribution Company, BEDC, to make good use of the facility when completed to boost power supply to the communities, urging the Disco to ensure that meters are provided for individual customers.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Benjamin Onwuka disclosed their plans in a statement he made available to journalists.\n\nOnwuka said sit-at-home had never helped the Biafra struggle, adding that the people should rather come out on May 30 for a Biafra parade.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be sitting at home since 2013 without a result. Sitting at home will not deliver independence to Biafra. India invented sit at home, and we must know that this is not India, it won\u2019t work anything here.\n\n\u201cOn May 30, Biafrans will not sit at home, they will come for a Biafra parade at Michael Okpara Square, Enugu, where I will take the salute. It will be a unique event,\u201d he claimed.\n\nWhile further claiming that he has the backing of the United States of America, Onwuka said, \u201cat the moment, Nigeria is no longer with the world powers. They have abandoned Nigeria, and that is why Biafra is no longer subjected to international isolation.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the US for its support. I have always said that what Biafra needs is international recognition. We lost the war weapons, and I don\u2019t mean physical weapons, I mean international diplomacy and support, that is the greatest weapon, the 5 UN permanent members of the Security Council were not with us. We won\u2019t make such a mistake again.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have been able to engage with the Biden administration, and we are happy for the outcome.\u201d\n\nHe said the people of the area had suffered several cases of injustice and deprivations from the Nigerian Government, stressing that \u201call these gave rise to all that are happening today, including the activities of the Unknown Gunmen.\n\n\u201cAll these years, they militarized our place with security operatives, even Customs are always seen chasing people to villages, searching booths of vehicles looking for rice. Where else do such things happen except Southern Nigeria? The extortion and oppression by the police was also in the highest level, so they gave birth to the Unknown Gunmen.\n\n\u201cIn all these, Zionists are urging our people not to be cowed down, the Biafrans will be liberated and they will enjoy total freedom.\u201d\n\nOn whether he was not afraid that the Federal Government would clamp him into detention again, Onwuka quipped: \u201cwe are not worried, we have international diplomacy, the US is with us.\u201d",

It is the beginning of struggle of labour, hope our politicians will cooperate with us to ensure we protect our democracy by delivering its dividends to the citizens including workers.\n\n\u201cMore than 90 per cent of Nigerians are living in abject poverty and that is why insecurity and other social vices have increased in the country.\u201d\n\nWabba assured that the organized labour is in Kaduna to tell the world the truth of what the workers, pensioners, students and other citizens in the state are going through besides the lies being peddled by media platforms on El-Rufai\u2019s payroll.\n\nHe explained that the situation of the workers in the state is so pathetic that thousands of them have been laid off from their sources of livelihood without the state government making any effort to pay them their entitlements.\n\nHe added that worse still, El-Rufai has gone further to increase the school fees thereby making the children of those sacked from their working place without payment to become dropouts.\n\nThe labour leader lamented that workers in the state were being sacked from their jobs without following the due process, adding that no constituted labour union was contacted by Governor El-Rufai before sacking the action.\n\n\u201cIt is only in Kaduna state out of the other states in the country that throw workers out of their jobs without any regards of the labour law and that is why we are here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that political elites are elected to respect the law of the land and uphold the provisions of the land, lamenting, \u201cHere we have a governor that is not respecting the law but violating the law with impunity. He has sacked thousands of workers in the state. Over 20,000 workers in the state have not been paid their April salary.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter sacking the workers from their jobs, governor Nasir El-Rufai has gone on to increase the school fees to also throw the students away from school whose parents have been sacked that have not been paid and as well as the pensioners,\u201d he added.\n\nHe refuted allegations made by the Governor that he had invited labour before sacking workers.\n\nHe also said that traders are not left behind as their shops have been demolished to deny them their means of livelihood, adding that with the policies of the state government, insecurity has become the order of the day in the state.\n\nWabba thanked other union leaders for cooperating with the NLC towards ensuring full compliance to the warning strike in the state, assuring that the organized labour would declare a five-day national strike across the country to ensure that their demands are met.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigerians should expect an increase in the pump price of Premium Motor Spirt (PMS), popularly called petrol anytime soon as the Petroleum Equalisation Fund(PEF), has concluded plans to increase petroleum transportation pricing template from N3.89k per litre to N9.11k, Daily Sun investigation has revealed.\n\nBut the Executive Secretary of PEF, Mr. Ahmed Bobboi, said the pricing template was delayed due to ongoing negotiations between labour and government.\n\nUnder the National Transportation Code(NTA) supervised by PEF, an organ of the Ministry of Petroleum, collections and claims settlement under NTA is mainly collected from two kinds of product transactions; Bridged products and Local transactions.\n\nNTA) on Bridged products are deducted at source from Marketers that are within Zone 1 and 2 (Claim Zone); while those within Zone 3-9 (Contribution Zone), are reimbursed for both the NTA and Bridging elements of their transactions.\n\nAn industry source who pleaded anonymity because of the political nature of PEF and fear of victimisation said should PEF increase NTA, price of fuel will increase. The source who lamented that PEF was a scam said that those that are meant to be contributing to PEF fund in zone 1 and 2 were not doing so, while those that are filling claims for zones 3-9 were not actually landing products at those locations.\n\nData from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC) shows that the North West region consumed more volume of petrol at 985,974,850 litres in QI 2020 compared to the Southeast region with 599,821,058 litres within the same period\n\nThe source said the idea of PEF was meant to stabilise petroleum product prices across the country, so that prices are not at variance from one location to the other.\n\n\u2018\u2018But the irony is that prices of petrol across the country have never been the same. The price you buy a litre of petrol in Enugu is not the same as Yobe. And this is what PEF meant to address. You will find that that those that were meant to transport petrol to Maiduguri, actually sell same in Lagos but make transport claim for same under a Maiduguri depot.\n\n\u201cThey forge documents and get the delivery papers signed to show that the products were actually delivered at Maiduguri. So over time, those that are supposed to be contributing to the fund in zones 1 and 2 were not fully complying and this created funding challenges for PEF that those they were meant to be reimbursed could not get it due to funding constraints.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe source added that those in zone 1 and 2 were the ones funding the fuel cost for those in very far location.\n\nHe added that this a practice that should be discouraged because it is fraud and should not have had a place if the sector have been deregulated.\n\n\u2018\u2018Technically, this is another form of subsidy. Nobody subsidies the cost of cows, goats, beans pepper and onions that are brought from the Northern part of the country to Lagos. The price you get these items in the North is different from that of Lagos.\n\nTo make matters worse, larger chunk of the petroleum products that PEF is subsiding, eventually finds its way to other neighboring countries which included; Niger, Chad, among others.",

          "title": "Eight Southern States Set to Enact Anti-Open Grazing Law",
          "text": "\u2022Ekiti, Abia, Ebonyi, Oyo, Bayelsa face implementation challenges\n\n\u2022Southern speakers, Ohanaeze back 17 govs\u2019 resolutions\n\nOur Reporters\n\nFollowing the resolution of the 17 governors of the Southern states banning open grazing of cattle in the three geopolitical zones in the South, no fewer than eight states are now set to enact anti-open grazing law to give legislative backing to the governors\u2019 pronouncement, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed.\n\nSome of these states include: Akwa Ibom, Ondo, Enugu, Edo, Imo, Ogun, Delta and Anambra,\n\nThis is coming as the apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the southern states\u2019 legislatures have declared their support for the resolutions of the 17 southern governors on open grazing and restructuring.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that states that already have the anti-open grazing law in place are facing challenges of implementation due to lack of commitment of the Police to enforce the law.\n\nThe affected states include: Ekiti, Abia, Ebonyi, Oyo and Bayelsa.\n\nIn Ekiti State, the anti-grazing law was passed under the acronym : \u201cProhibition of Cattle and Other Ruminants Grazing Law 2016\u201d.\n\nBut the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, told THISDAY that the federal government\u2019s recalcitrant posture on the creation of State police was stalling the enforcement of the state\u2019s Anti-Open Grazing Law.\n\nAfuye said the law, passed in 2016 under the former Governor Ayodele Fayose, with the present Kayode Fayemi-led government strengthening the law further, could have been better implemented, but for unitary nature of the Nigerian Police.\n\nAfuye appealed to the National Assembly to accede to the request for the creation of State Police in the impending Constitutionl\n\nReview to be undertaken by the 9th National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe police seem to be firmly under the control of the federal even when the governors are the chief security officers. This is an aberration under a federation.\n\n\u201cBut if all the states have their own police that can be controlled by the governors, a law like this promulgated by states can be enforced easily.\n\n\u201cBut we have the Amotekun Corps that has been trying to checkmate some of these suspected herders destroying our farms and causing food scarcity.\u201d\n\nIn Abia State, the anti-open grazing law has been in existence for nearly three years.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Control of Nomadic Cattle Rearing and Prohibition of Grazing Routes/Reserves Bill 2016 was passed into law by the State House of Assembly in June 2018.\n\nThe law provides that the entry of trade cattle into the state shall be by rail or by road haulage.\n\nIt further stipulates that movement of trade cattle to major towns in the state shall be by truck, trailers/vehicles or pick-up vans.\n\nIt provides that defaulters, if convicted, shall be punished with a fine of N200,000 or six months imprisonment or both.\n\nHowever, the anti-open grazing law has been largely ignored by the police and other federal security agencies.\n\nGovernor Okezie Ikpeazu had publicly expressed his frustration with the security agencies\u2019 failure or even outright refusal to enforce the anti-open grazing law.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu told THISDAY that the attitude of federal- controlled security agencies to take orders only from federal authorities has further reinforced the clamour for the establishment of state police.\n\nIn Oyo State, the state House of Assembly in October 2019 passed a bill titled: \u2018Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Law\u2019, which has been signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde,.\n\nThe law states, among others, that anyone who engages in open rearing or grazing of livestock is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for five years or a fine of N500,000 or both.\n\nSubsequent offenders shall upon conviction be liable to 10-year imprisonment or a fine of N2 million or both.\n\nSpeaking on the challenges facing its implementation in the state, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, told THISDAY that the state has not been able to implement the law because the security agencies with the power to enforce it are under the control of the federal government.\n\nHe said the challenge was due to the fact that the country is not practising federalism.\n\n\u201cWhile the anti-open grazing law has become fully operational in the state, however there is no doubt that there is problem in its implementation with the state not in control of the security agencies who have the force of law to enforce it. Indeed, the implementation is been hampered by the slow response by the police to enforce the law,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso despite the enactment of the anti-open grazing law by the Bayelsa State Government to keep cattle within the Bayelsa Oil Palm Estate, Elebele near Yenagoa, farmers in the state have continued to complain that herdsmen still moved their cattle around and encroached on farmlands.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the police in the state were not committed to the enforcement of the law.\n\nBut the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Ayiba Fuba, told THISDAY that the state government would view seriously any case of herders of cattle in the state flouting the law.\n\nEbonyi State government had also enacted law on Anti-open grazing in 2018.\n\nBut since legislation: \u201cLaw No. 010 of 2018: Ebonyi State Miscellaneous Offences Law, 2018,\u201d was assented to by the Governor David Umahi, the law has become dormant due to non-implementation even with the constant clashes between herders and farmers in the state .\n\nA top official of the state government told THISDAY at the weekend that the state government has no means of enforcing the law in the state.\n\n\u201cThe anti-open grazing law has been passed. But you know that it is not part of the rules of engagement of the federal police or any other security agencies to enforce. So, it\u2019s hopeful that with the formation of Ebube Agu security outfit, they can begin to enforce the law in the state,\u201d he said\n\nEight Southern States Set to Enact Law\n\nDespite the challenges in the implementation of the law by the states that had enacted it, no fewer than eight states are now set to enact anti-open grazing law following the pronouncement of the 17 southern governors.\n\nIn Ondo State, the anti-open grazing law has passed through the public hearing stage at the Ondo State House of Assembly.\n\nThe Chairman, House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Gbenga Omole, told THISDAY at the weekend that the proposed law, was committed for public hearing after it had passed through the First and Second Reading.\n\nHe said the proposed law had been committed to committee level and would have been passed if not for the strike by Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN).\n\nThe lawmaker said the proposed law, when passed would replace the former Western State Forestry Law, that is no longer useful for the current situation concerning grazing.\n\nIn Enugu State, the state lawmakers said they were eagerly awaiting the Executive Bill expected to herald the anti-grazing law in the state.\n\nChairman of the House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Jeff Mba told THISDAY that the 24 members of the assembly were ready to support any move to protect the lives and property of the people.\n\nHe explained that since it would be an executive bill, the legislators were eagerly expecting the executive arm of government to do the needful.\n\nIn Edo State, the state House of Assembly said it already had a private bill against open grazing, which was kept in abeyance because of its sensitive nature.\n\nThe lawmakers said they were waiting for Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s Executive Bill against open grazing to fine-tune it.\n\n\u201cThe private bill was Kept in View (KIV) because we want to conduct a public hearing\u201d, Edo State Speaker, Hon. Marcus Onobu, told THISDAY on Friday.\n\nOnobu however, added that with the outcome and resolution of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum in Asaba, Delta State, the assembly was more determined to work on the anti-open grazing bill by passing it into law as soon as possible.\n\nOsun State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode told THISDAY that the state had already put a law in place, which places duty on owners of livestock to take proper care of their livestock and keep them in check within perimeter fencing to prevent them from roaming and disturbing other people\u2019s properties or damaging crops .\n\nShe further disclosed that the state government is ready to review the law to accommodate other current realities if the need arises.\n\n\u201cAccording to Section 27(4) of the Law, any person who violates the provision of the law is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe disclosed that Osun State has always been supportive of stakeholders in agribusiness and farmers , whether those in crop farming or livestock farming know this.\n\n\u201cThe existing law discourages open-grazing. To further ensure peaceful co-existence in our agribusiness sector, the state also has a committee in place where herders and crop farmers relate and resolve issues before they spiral out of control. We have been able to manage the sector because Governor Oyetola is particularly interested in growing agriculture as a business.\u201d\n\nHowever the commissioner stressed that \u201cif there is a need to review the existing Livestock Roaming Law to accommodate new sections or current realities, you can be rest assured that our response will be swift. We are all about safety and security of citizens of Osun, livestock farmers, crop farmers, everybody counts in Osun\u201d\n\nAlso in his own submission the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon Timothy Owoeye who spoke through to THISDAY through the lawmakers\u2019 image maker, Hon. Kunle Alabi confirmed that the state has a law that prohibits open grazing of livestocks.\n\nThe Cross River State Government is also planning to enact the anti-open grazing law.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the state lawmakers had through a resolution urged the state government to reject open grazing by cattle and other animals because it was against an established environmental law of the state.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Hon. Eteng Jonah William, told THISDAY that \u201cthe resolution subsists and the lawmakers remain opposed to open grazing.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the resolution of the Southern governors\u2019 forum was just an affirmation of the position held by the lawmakers.\n\nThough the Cross River State Government was not represented at the Southern Governors\u2019 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, where open grazing was banned, the Special Adviser on Media and Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ben Ayade, Mr. Christian Nta, told THISDAY that the state was part of the decision, and would wait for modalities to be worked out before enacting any law.\n\nAyade had introduced the cultivation of special specie of grass known as \u201cKing Grass,\u201d to be exported to other parts of the country to feed livestocks.\n\nIn Anambra State, there is no law banning open grazing of cattle but a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, who spoke to THISDAY said the lawmakers were awaiting executive bill on the issue to curb the frequent clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nImo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Declan Emelumba referred THISDAY to the state house of Assembly, noting that it was the house of Assembly that has right to talk on the subject matter.\n\nA member of the House of Assembly told THISDAY that the lawmakers will initiate the bill as soon as the security challenges in the state are resolved.\n\nSouthern Speakers, Ohanaeze Back 17 govs\u2019 Resolutions\n\nMeanwhile, the apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the southern states\u2019 legislatures have declared their support for the resolutions of the 17 southern governors on open grazing and restructuring.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mr. Alex Ogbonnia told journalists in Enugu at the weekend that the move would go a long way in dealing with the prolonged clashes between herdsmen and farmers.\n\nHe regretted that the herdsmen have been allowed to carry guns over the years which has often given them the courage to always attack communities that do not allow them to destroy their farms.\n\n\u201cEverything they talked about during the meeting is in line with the position of Ohanaeze and we are very comfortable with it because open grazing has been the source of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nOn reactions by some northern elements over the ban, he said \u201cit is normal for people to protest against moves, whether good or bad. Change comes with a level of resistance. But we hope they will come to realize the importance of the ban and queue in because it is something that has to be done\u201d.\n\nOn their part, the speakers commended the Southern Governors \u201cfor coming together to speak with one voice\u201d, saying the resolutions of the Southern Governors were pathways to resolving the plethora of problems facing the country, including insecurity.\n\nThey said that the issues that prompted the resolutions reached by the governors in the recent meeting in Asaba were too well known to all Nigerians, that all that was required was for the federal government to take appropriate steps urgently to address the issues canvassed by the southern governors.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists, the lawmakers vowed to use their position to give the resolutions by the governors the needed legislative backing or support.\n\nThe Speakers in a statement made available to THISDAY in Asaba, said: \u201cWe the Speakers of State Legislatures in Southern Nigeria commend the Governors of the Southern States for their patriotism and firm belief in the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cWe adopt all the positions in the communique and reiterate the call for the ban on open grazing of cattle in the South.\n\n\u201cWe support the call for the restructuring of the country to enthrone true federalism and therefore the convocation of a National Dialogue is inevitable,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cWe also urge the Governors to send bills to the (respective) Legislature, where necessary, to address some of the issues in the communiqu\u00e9\u201d.\n\nThey hailed the Governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, for providing the platform for the meeting of the governors.\n\nThe speakers\u2019 resolution was signed by Chief Sheriff F.O Oborevwori, Deputy National Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria; Mr Aniekan Bassey, Vice-Chairman South-South, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria; Francis O.Nwifuru, Vice-Chairman South East, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria; and, Prince Olakunle Taiwo Oluomo, Vice-Chairman South-West, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nAs Nigeria grapples with the challenge of a looming threat of third wave of COVID-19 hitting the country, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and a renowned professor of Virology and infectious disease control, Prof. Olawale Tomori, have cautioned the federal government not to allow complacency to stall measures being taken to check the outbreak of a third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, stressing that averting the scourge goes beyond just issuing travel advisory.\n\nThey noted that the most important steps would be the enforcement and implementation of the measures put in place.\n\nThey however commended the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 on the recently issued international travel advisory and the re-introduction of restrictions, all aimed at averting the third wave of the infection.\n\nNMA\u2019s President, Prof. Innocent Ujah told THISDAY at the weekend that the federal government should ensure adequate enforcement and monitoring of the measures it recently announced to check the importation of a more deadly variant of COVID-19 virus from other countries.\n\n\u201cI want to say that NMA is very happy and we commend federal government for taken proactive steps to respond to the threat of a third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, by issuing timely health advisory regarding those passengers coming from Turkey, India and Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is a very commendable effort because this is what we had advocated for early in 2020 shortly before COVID-19 came in, that we should close our borders so that we don\u2019t have any importation of the virus, but unfortunately before they did that, it was late and therefore many of our people got infected. However, this time , the advisory note issued by the federal government is very important and NMA commends it,\u201d he said..\n\nThe NMA boss spoke on the aspect of the travel restrictions contained in the government\u2019s COVID-19 health advisory, describing it as good decision.\n\nHe, however pointed out that the authorities should not stop at that but should ensure that the recommended health protocols be strictly enforced to make the response effective.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is strict enforcement and monitoring so that anybody coming into the country must be made to go through a protocol and then be quarantined and if tested positive, kept in isolation centre.\n\n\u201cThis requires strict monitoring because science monitoring. When they monitor and discover that many people coming in, test positive then they can effect a travel ban to those countries.\n\nOn the suggestion that government should go further to impose outright travel ban on countries proven to be witnessing resurgent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Ujah said NMA would go for a systematic approach that would be based on correct analysis of the present situation.\n\n\u201cWe need to systematically follow the issue because COVID-19 has socio-economic consequences. So, I think we should be very careful and be able to enforce the health protocols \u2013 for instance, ensuring that people take precautionary measures such as putting on facemasks and observing social distancing\u201d.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of revamping the vaccine production factory in Nigeria, Ujah said it was a good plan.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with the setting up of the joint venture facility between May and Baker and Bio-vaccine, NMA believed the country was on verge of establishing the local vaccine manufacturing facility.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the federal government to do something to revamp the vaccine production company in Yaba, Lagos State so that Nigeria can be able to produce vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cNigerians are talented and hard-working and all they need is encouragement,\u201d Ujah said.\n\nWhile reacting to the delay in actualising the resuscitation of the vaccine factory, Ujah said that the problem may be due to lack of confidence by foreign partners and the security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cWe need to build confidence. Nigerian government should be able to provide a conducive environment; the security situation must improve because nobody wants to invest in a country where there is violence, kidnapping, maiming, Boko Haram, and armed robbery. These are some of the things that probably may be making other countries to be hesitant to come and partner with us . But you see, partnership and collaboration is what we need if we are to reestablish and reactivate vaccine production in Nigeria,\u201d he said .\n\nWhile supporting NMA\u2019s position, Tomori said the problem with the country\u2019s efforts to check the spread of COVID-19 virus were that of poor compliance and poor enforcement of the health advisory.\n\nTomori told THISDAY that whether the country would relapse into another wave of COVID-19 pandemic or not would depend on how the people cooperate with government to maintain non-pharmaceutical protocols.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe do not have the third wave yet. but it may come. Government has done the right thing by this selective targeting of activities likely to contribute to the spread of the disease. It is now in our hands to make sure we do not allow the virus to spread.\n\n\u201cThrough our carelessness and disregard of non-pharmaceutucal interventions, we got the second wave. If we continue, the third wave is sure to come\u201d.\n\nWhile assessing the measures rolled out by the federal government, Tomori said the steps were good but needed to be embraced by all the citizens for it to be more effective in checking the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFor now, the measures are okay. The need for additional measures depends on whether we, the citizens collaborate with government in adhering to the guidelines or not. We should get involved and play an active role by encouraging and ensuring the participation of every citizen.\n\n\u201cThe government has already suspended flights from some countries. I am sure the situation is being monitored by the government,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u202212 countries also beneficiaries\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has picked 26 foreign and local companies as well as 12 countries to lift the country\u2019s crude oil for the next two years.\n\nThe crude term contracts, expected to run from 2021 through 2023, would see the firms and the selected nations, which would operate on a Government-to-Government (G2G) basis to purchase the commodity from the national oil company.\n\nThe deal is coming less than a week after the corporation chose 16 oil and gas consortia for its new crude-for-fuel swap contracts for one year starting in August.\n\nThe contracts, known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP) are high-stakes agreements used to supply nearly all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol needs as well as cover some of its diesel and jet fuel consumption.\n\nHowever, in the fresh crude oil term agreements, it was observed that the names of majority of the companies involved in the DSDP deal also appeared in the list of those picked by the national oil company for the crude term contracts.\n\nThe list sighted by THISDAY showed that the preferred companies included Sahara Energy Resources Limited, Oando, Duke oil (an NNPC subsidiary), Petrogas, AA Rano, MRS, Mercuria and Vitol.\n\nOther oil and gas concerns which scaled the NNPC selection hurdle were Oceanbed Trading Limited, Levene Energy, Bono Energy , Mocoh Energy, BP Oil, West Africa Gas Limited, Litasco SA, Emadeb, Hyde, Matrix and Brittania-U.\n\nOther names listed by the NNPC as having qualified for the contracts included Masters, AMG, Casiva, Barbedos, Trafigura, Hindustan and Patermina.\n\nNNPC has its own equity share of crude oil from its Joint Ventures (JVs), usually shared on a 60 to 40 basis and thereafter appoints companies and issues licences to lift its share of the oil on a Free on Board (FOB) basis.\n\nThe companies and countries nominate ships that transport the crude which is sold in the international market. Sometimes, the NNPC also awards contracts to governments to carry out the business.\n\nIn the document approving the qualified countries, China, Niger, Cote D\u2019voire, Ghana, India, Togo, South Africa came tops, while Sierra Leone, Liberia, Turkey, Senegal, and Fujaira also made the cut.\n\nTypically, entities qualified to take part in the contract bid are divided into four categories, namely a bonafide end user who owns a refinery and or retail outlets that can process Nigerian crude oil grades.\n\nFor the government to government contracts, or what is termed \u201cbilateral relationships\u201d, with what the corporation terms \u201chigh energy consuming nations\u201d, bidding nations must provide proof that the entity is wholly owned by the relevant country or provide evidence of a bilateral agreement with the designated nation.\n\nThe third category is the internationally established and globally recognised large volume crude oil traders, while the fourth classification are indigenous companies engaged in Nigeria oil and gas downstream business activities.\n\nIn addition, qualifying foreign companies must demonstrate a minimum annual turnover of $500 million or the naira equivalent and a net worth of not less than $250 million or the naira equivalent for the previous financial year.\n\nFor indigenous firms, they are required to have a minimum turnover of $200 million or the naira equivalent and a net worth of $100 million for the preceding financial year ending.\n\nBidders are also to show their ability to handle supplies of crude and must list facilities and products processed or sold over the last three years, in addition to disclosing links to NNPC or the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPE) and confirming that directors have not been convicted of fraud or financial impropriety.\n\nAs with all Nigerian tenders, NNPC also highlights that the local content law must be strictly adhered to in terms of, among others, the use of Nigerian shipping companies, insurance and banks where possible.\n\nIn the past, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the country\u2019s oil and gas space had argued that G2G contracts with smaller, non-refining countries have high governance risks and low policy benefits for Nigeria.\n\nFor instance the Nigeria Natural Resource Charter (NNRC) has asked that term contracts should be carried out through a transparent and competitive tender process that includes robust pre-qualification standards and an end of sales to smaller non-refining countries unless NNPC can publicly explain the deals\u2019 policy benefits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We are being chased out of Nasarawa State, and we are appealing to the governor not to allow the seemingly planned elimination of the Tiv community succeed under his watch.\u201d\n\nHowever, when contacted, the state Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Ramhan Nansel, said there was no report of such killings at the Giza Division of the state police command.\n\nIn a related development, four people were on Saturday killed when herdsmen attacked Yelwata community of Guma Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nAccording to a local source, those killed were teenagers who were working on their farm when the herdsmen stormed the area and killed them.\n\nFollowing the attack, angry youths in the area who recovered the corpses of the victims blocked the Makurdi-Lafia highway for several hours.\n\nEfforts by the military, the police and other security agencies to get the angry youths off the road were said to have been rebuffed causing heavy traffic gridlock on the major highway.\n\nAccording to the Chairman of Guma Local Government, Caleb Abah, three of the young men were killed on the farm while the fourth person died after one of the security personnel accidentally fired a shot at the angry crowd.\n\n\u201cSadly, in an attempt to disperse the angry youths who were resisting, there was a shot by the security agencies and unfortunately, one of the protesters was hit by a bullet and killed.\n\n\u201cAs we speak right now, calm has been restored to the area and we are already making arrangements for the dead to be buried,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe acknowledged the efforts of Governor Samuel Ortom who quickly mobilized some government functionaries to the troubled area to calm frayed nerves, which resulted in the quick resolution of the matter.\n\nHowever, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene could not be reached as at the time of filing this report as she did not pick or return calls.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Absolutely nothing has been done and yet you see increasing failure of the state to protect citizens,\u201d he had said\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to the call for the president\u2019s impeachment, Ogun, while speaking with Arise TV on Monday, said tribalism will hinder the process at the national assembly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to get enough signatures to impeach the president anytime soon. We tried that in the eighth assembly and I, personally, signed. But we didn\u2019t have enough signatures,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\n\u201cAnd I said a colleague of mine said, then, why should he support the impeachment of a Fulani Man or somebody from the north to the advantage of somebody from the south-west. Basically saying he doesn\u2019t like the president but why should he support his impeachment for a Yoruba man to take over. That was the sentiment then and it\u2019s even stronger today. So I don\u2019t think we are going to get any traction there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOgun also said the president resigning is not realistic, adding that there will be a counter-campaign even if he eventually concedes to pressure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president will resign, this is Nigeria. If there\u2019s enough pressure for him to resign, you\u2019re going to have people who are going to be paid and mobilised to protest for him to stay. And we don\u2019t need that right now with all the insecurity,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t come out right, they blame the editors.\u201d\n\nChuks Oteke had had enough of the complaints about his work. In 2012, he set up his video production studio where he provided visual effects and video editing services, but every now and then he received complaints from clients who were dissatisfied with his work. To them, Oteke was the problem but to him, the problem was the raw video cuts he got from his clients.\n\nThe shots taken on set didn\u2019t really tell the story and the clients believed that any shortcoming could be fixed in post-production.\n\nWhen he couldn\u2019t take it anymore he decided to look into why the shots were poor. He took on different camera operator jobs on different video shoot sets. At the end of his research, he came to the conclusion that the camera operators didn\u2019t have the right tools to get the right shots.\n\n\u201cTo tell a good story, it\u2019s not just about the camera. You need to position the lighting right, you also need to frame the shots appropriately. If a character is feeling depressed, the camera angle should help depict depression. High angles help with this by making the actor seem small or overwhelmed. On the contrary, a low angle helps in depicting joy or happiness,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some cases, a crane is needed to achieve these shots but how many people can afford it?\n\nThis informed his decision to go into creating tools for shooting videos. He started with making prototypes of DIY tools. It didn\u2019t officially become a business until some people offered to pay him for the tools.\n\n\u201cSo I started making noise on Instagram and Facebook about how I make customised DIY tools and the response was good. It got to a point where there was so much demand I just couldn\u2019t meet up with it.\u201d\n\nThis birthed Film Anatomie, one of the few African companies designing and manufacturing filming equipment. It caters for a wide range of clients such as independent content creators, filmmakers, television studios and even equipment rental companies.\n\nA component of the slider created by Film Anatomie\n\nGetting into General Electric (GE) Garage\n\nHigh demand could have fooled someone else to think they were in business but not Oteke. He quickly realised that he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable enough to turn his interest into a business so he enrolled in the General Electric (GE) Garage Program in 2014. During the training program, which spanned across a few years, his mind was opened to advanced manufacturing techniques, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc.\n\nHe remarked that simply learning about product design influenced the design of his products.\n\nDuring the program, Oteke met other participants who were into robotics, aviation, STEM education and biomedicine.\n\nAt the end, he had access to over a thousand local and foreign mentors in the tech space.\n\n\u201cI now had this network of people I can contact at any time and say, \u2018I have this problem, how can I solve it?\u2019 Definitely, there\u2019ll be somebody who knows somebody else who can help.\u201d\n\nDifficulty in getting funding\n\nArmed with this knowledge and network, he set out to run a better business. He knew where and how to get raw materials. It wasn\u2019t possible to make everything locally but with 80% local raw materials the cost of production was low.\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle was finance. He needed a business partner as well as capital.\n\n\u201cI am a techie. I\u2019m not a business person. So I was looking for investors who\u2019d provide capital and also business advice. It took a while for me; other participants had already gotten investments.\u201d\n\nGraduates of the GE Garage Program were introduced to a pool of investors in their fields. While many of the other participants had business ideas that were seen as important, Oteke\u2019s idea was seen as a nice-to-have. Investors showed little to no interest in him until the movie Lionheart was released.\n\nHow Lionheart changed everything\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know Genevieve, I\u2019ve never met her, but she doesn\u2019t know what she has done for me.\u201d\n\nGenevieve Nnaji\u2019s Lionheart made headlines in 2018 for its milestone as a pioneering Nigerian Netflix original. Finally, investors started paying attention to the creative industry. Oteke started getting some attention.\n\nIn an industry that barely has ready data, Oteke had to crowdsource and develop a realistic projection for his business. He found out that the Nigerian movie industry produces about 50 movies per week and generates an impressive $590million in revenue annually.\n\nHis pitch to investors was simple: the filming industry market is smaller than it will be in a few years time, it\u2019s easier to gain a large market share now.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s creative industry doesn\u2019t have a repository but with Netflix you could see the views and how much was being paid. Lionheart was reportedly bought for $3.8m.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, while it was easier to get overall industry statistics, he still had issues getting numbers because his target audience are moviemakers, not actors. He reached out to different production teams to get a sense of how much they spent on equipment and what the demand was like.\n\n\u201cI reached out to friends in film production and film schools. I established a relationship with Dell York, Jeta Amata and Olu Jacobs\u2019 film school. I\u2019m trying to establish one with Ebony life. We hope to grow to the point where you can come to us when you need the numbers for Africa\u2019s creative industry.\u201d\n\nA member of Film Anatomie working on a new product\n\nGetting Investment\n\nAfter one of Oteke\u2019s pitches at GE garage, an investor from Platform capital* reached out to him. The conversation, unlike others, looked promising.\n\n\u201cI remember I told him \u2018I\u2019m not really much of a business person, and I know you can help. You also have access to other markets like Asia, America and the UK\u2019. He was quite open and he wanted to build a film academy, a production company, and [had] a lot of other creative ideas.\u201d\n\nOteke finally got investment just before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made it difficult to get a few necessary things but was also a blessing because at that time they pivoted to making face masks with their 3D printers. It was a business opportunity that kept the lights on for a while before they returned back to their main focus: creating film equipment.\n\nA sample of the Face Mask made with 3D printer\n\nOteke and some team members at work\n\nOffering free products to get customers\n\nAs the effects of the pandemic waned and filming activities began, Oteke and his team were tasked with finding customers. Unlike other popular filming equipment, people were hesitant towards trusting their expensive cameras and filming gadgets with less popular locally made equipment. Building trust was the next hurdle they had to jump.\n\n\u201cWe found a way to mitigate that problem by offering our products for free. We targeted selected customers who could help us publicize our brand. For instance, I took my slider to where some big filmmakers were filming. I let them use my own on one camera while they use their own slider on the main camera. At the end of the shoot, I\u2019d ask them \u2018what do you think I can do to make this tool better?\u2019 They\u2019d tell me and we\u2019d make the adjustments.\u201d\n\nA number of them were often satisfied, when they asked for the price, the price difference made Film Anatomie\u2019s products more appealing. His sliders cost about \u20a6100,000 (~$220) while the existing more popular sliders with the same features are more expensive, costing between $500 \u2013 $1,000.\n\nOteke discussing with a team member, while making reference to a 3D computer-aided design\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nOteke might have started making equipment for the film industry but at the heart of what he does is manufacturing where there\u2019s a need. The goal for him is to manufacture for other sectors like 3D printing for car parts and household materials.\n\nA 3D printer built by Chuks Oteke. He built it using some parts created by the first 3D printer he bought.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we don\u2019t make anything, we just consume. There has been some success in the fintech space and agricultural space, but in the hardware manufacturing space we still worship China.\u201d\n\nHe believes the future is in designing and manufacturing in Africa.\n\nOteke\u2019s big project for the year is an electric vehicle that would be used for site inspections in real estate and for video shoots. The car would be able to ride on regular roads and on rough terrains.\n\nA 3D computer-aided design of the electric car\n\nThe frame of the electric car in the workshop\n\nFor Oteke and his team at Film Anatomie, the vision to create homegrown solutions is massive. They\u2019re focused on building and collaborating with others thinking in the same line.\n\n*Platform Capital is an investor in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "text": "Airtel Africa, the holding company for Bharti Airtel\u2019s operations in Africa, has released its financial report for the year ended March 31, 2021. One of the report highlights is that the company\u2019s revenues are up by 14.2% to $3.8 billion.\n\nOn the back of this revenue, Airtel Africa also posted net profits of $415 million, a slight growth of 1.8% from the previous year where it made $408 million in profits after tax.\n\nDespite the flat profit growth, it is still an impressive result for the business in a year where Covid-19 has stalled economic growth across Africa. Additionally, in Nigeria, the company\u2019s biggest market, a ban on SIM card registration stifled growth.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s CEO, Raghunath Mandava, said in a statement, \u201cIn these challenging times, I want to say a huge thank you to all our employees, our business partners, and governments and regulators who have supported us, and in turn facilitated our continued support to the economies and communities we serve.\n\nOur performance has been strong, \u201cwith reported growth of 13.6% in underlying revenue and 18.3% in underlying EBITDA, and constant currency growth of 19.4% and 25.2%, respectively. Contributions to this growth came across all regions, with particular improvement in Francophone Africa, and across all our major services, with mobile money, data and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nA look at the company\u2019s significant services shows that voice revenue continues to lead the way, bringing in more than half its revenue. Yet, that does not tell the whole story, as the growth in voice revenue has slowed over the last few years.\n\nData and mobile money revenue are the real stars of the show. Data contributed 35% to the revenue as it continues to show promise as Airtel deepens its investment in internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cData usage per customer reached 2.6 GB per customer (from 1.8 GB per customer) led by an increase in smartphone penetration and expansion of our home broadband and enterprise customers. This helped us grow data revenue 31.2% in constant currency. Growing penetration and usage of 3G and 4G data customers helped us grow data ARPU 8.2%. 4G data usage more than doubled in the year, contributing 62.2% of total data usage on the network in Q4\u201921.\u201d\n\nAirtel Money is also seeing significant growth, adding $401 million to revenue compared to the $311 million it added last year. According to Airtel, \u201cWe have increased the number of mobile money agents by 30.7%, kiosks by 68.8% and mobile money branches by 95%. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, both through partnerships with leading financial institutions and through expansion of our merchant ecosystem, have further strengthened our mobile money propositions.\u201d\n\nAnother important update from the report is a leadership change at Airtel Africa as Mandava will retire from his post and as a director on 30 September. Olusegun Ogunsanya will take over as the new managing director and CEO.",

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users.

Users are also able to create multiple cards instantly and can easily dedicate each card to one web platform.\n\nFundall \u2013 run by a company of the same name founded in 2019 \u2013 is on a mission to provide all things money in one place to their customers.

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nEmmanuel here.\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nAmazon-M-Pesa integration\n\nNigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub\n\nNigerian Startup Bill proposal\n\nAmazon-M-Pesa integration\n\nM\u2013Pesa users would soon be able to pay for items on Amazon as Safaricom executives disclose that they\u2019re in talks with the eCommerce giant on a possible partnership. There are not many details on how the integration would work or when it would be finalised.\n\nContext: Founded in 2007 and now owned by South Africa\u2019s Vodacom and Kenya\u2019s telecom giant, Safaricom, M-Pesa has grown to become one of the world\u2019s largest mobile money services, with over 40 million subscribers.\n\nThe service is available in seven countries: Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Lesotho.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe big picture: While this partnership could ease payments for M-Pesa users, it doesn\u2019t solve the problem of deliveries (shipping) since most items on Amazon do not directly ship to Africa or are priced very high.\n\nThird-party importers also help ease this problem, but their services often do not come cheap.\n\nBut then, Safaricom could be using this to position M-Pesa as a globally acceptable payments service. In 2019, the company partnered with eCommerce giant AliExpress, and it has also secured partnerships with the likes of Visa and PayPal.\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s revenue dropped 2.1% in 2020, a first for the brand, and it seems to be exploring more ways to expand its market share.\n\nNigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub\n\nOn Saturday, May 8, 2021, the first dedicated Nigerian blockchain hub, Convexity Blockchain Hub (CBHUB), was inaugurated in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city.\n\nAdedeji Owonibi, CBHUB Founder, says the aim is to create a hub ecosystem where people can come and just focus in a space dedicated to blockchain technology, a space to innovate and create solutions within Nigeria using blockchain.\n\nInteresting use cases: The hub will be used to develop solutions like creating transparency for humanitarian aid distributions, reducing certificate counterfeiting in schools, and improving security, among others.\n\nSome context: Nigeria has become one of the world\u2019s most popular destinations for cryptocurrency, blockchain technology\u2019s most popular product. But other sub-sectors are still fledgeling for a technology that has been likened to the Internet itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut was Convexity truly the first? Our reporter, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo, delved more into the story. In case you missed it.\n\nA Startup Bill for Nigeria\n\n\n\nSome Nigerian startup founders and some key government executives are currently discussing a Startup Bill.\n\nPer TechCabal, Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian president on digital transformation; Ife Adebayo, Special Assistant to the vice president on innovation and entrepreneurship, and some Nigerian tech entrepreneurs and investors were at the meeting.\n\nDespite a very troubling policy history featuring a ban that almost crippled the mobility and logistics sector (thank you innovation), the government executives say this time would be different; entrepreneurs are seemingly hopeful.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has assured of plans to connect residential areas and 70km street lights to the 55MW CCETC-Ossiomo Power Plant in Benin City, for supply of 24-hour electricity.\n\nObaseki gave the assurance during the Edo State Town Hall Meeting with the Transition Committee Members and the state\u2019s stakeholders from across the world via Zoom meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cOssiomo Power is on. It is what is being used in Government House. We are trying to create an electricity commission with laws that will allow them to sell to people outside of the state government facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Secretariat building and Government House are being powered by Ossiomo. It is on and working. We have a project to put about 70km of street lights around Benin City. The contractors are working on that. It is going to be powered by Ossiomo Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to change the laws to enable a distribution company to move the power from Ossiomo to your own homes; that is what we are working on now. Before long, the law should be passed, with the necessary regulatory permits obtained so that we can get power to individuals. Be rest assured that the turbines are there and are firing,\u201d the governor added.\n\nOn the dualisation of the Ekehuan Road project, the Obaseki noted, \u201cwe are not owing the contractors; we have enough money to complete the project. Major work has been done. It is just left for surfacing; the paving has been done. I won\u2019t be surprised if they come to site to finish up on time.\n\n\u201cThe rains particularly in April were quite treacherous and may have slowed down the pace of work for them. I want to assure you that funding is not a problem for the project. We have raised the bond early this year and part of the fund is for the project.\n\nThe money is there in the bank to fund the contractor.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "The remains of renowned cardiologist cum military historian, Nowamagbe Omoigui, was on Saturday interred at the Greenlawn Memorial Park, Columbia, USA.\n\nAs a part of his final obsequies, a double-headed funeral service was held at St. John Neumann Church, Columbia, USA as well as a traditional farewell at his ancestral home in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nMr Omoigui who excelled as a cardiologist was renowned for his ingenuity in documenting stories about the Nigerian military.\n\nBorn March 28, 1959, the cardiologist, who set records everywhere he went, died on April 18, aged 62.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, both dates were set aside to mark an annual event in his memory at an event where friends and family paid tributes to him.\n\nA memorial lecture will be held on April 18 every year to commemorate the day of his passing. Likewise, an annual art and history exhibition will be held on 28th March every year to mark the day of his birth.\n\nAs part of measures to preserve his legacy, an art and history centre was launched to immortalize his scholarly works and interest.\n\nIn an emotionally charged tribute, family, associates, friends, and admirers recalled moments they shared with the man who many called \u201ca man of many parts\u201d because of his versatility and insatiable thirst for knowledge.\n\nA schoolmate and close friend of Mr Omoigui, Augustine Onwukwe, described him as \u201ca man with great wit and intelligence\u201d who it would be \u201cdemeaning to call (just) a cardiologist\u201d because of how \u201cbecame famous and an authority on military history\u201d\n\nAlthough a cardiologist by training, the late Mr Omoigui demonstrated how vast he was about the history of his country, particularly during the military era where coups, countercoups and a deadly civil war nearly tore the country apart.\n\nA teary brother of the deceased, Nosa Omoigui, praised his sibling\u2019s drive for knowledge by saying, \u201cNowa reads and comprehends because he enjoys it. He was always loyal,\u201d recalling how the deceased paid attention to details as he could recall pages of books he read with the exact information on the page.\n\nOne of his schoolmates at the University Teaching Hospital, Ibadan, Emil Mondoa, described him as a down-to-earth person, one who could interact with anyone below him without barriers.\n\n\u201cHe has lots of medical books, but even more military books,\u201d Mr Mondoa said in the virtual event. \u201cHe connected with everyone at every level. He would do so many things that you wonder if he has time for medical work.\u201d\n\nGodwin Odia, a retired captain, had planned to visit the late Mr Omoigui on May 15 but was shell shocked to hear of his passing.\n\n\u201cTwo to three weeks ago, he told me he was going for a second Covid-19 shot. We spoke with each other for more than 25 minutes. Never did I imagine that I was coming to his funeral on May 15.\u201d\n\nBefore becoming close family friends, no love was lost between the two men, the captain recalled.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut we fought ourselves to brotherhood,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwhen we meet, we discuss family, we discuss life, we discuss school.\u201d\n\n\u201cNowa is human. When you meet you will forget the academic excellence he has attained. No one was too small to talk to Nowa. He will come to your level.\u201d\n\nEkiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, also paid tribute to the departed, saying when it comes to the history of the Nigerian military, he knew no one who had a mastery of it than Mr Omoigui.\n\n\u201cWhether he was writing about the civil war or the military coup or about military personalities, you were never in doubt about the depth of his knowledge,\u201d Mr Fayemi said.\n\n\u201cWe will miss Nowa Omoigui. We will miss him for his knowledge, for his passion for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAt a time that our military is confronted with the task to tackle insecurity in the country amidst the trend of violence, we could all imagine the contribution Mr Omoigui could have on the discourse,\u201d the governor noted.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nCompelled by growing pressure occasioned by unrestrained attacks by bandits and sundry non-state actors, fast gaining a foothold in a region that once thought itself immune to terrorism, governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states, last week, in a move that may well be a turning point in the country\u2019s chequered journey to nationhood, met in Asaba, Delta State capital.\n\nAfter nearly five hours of deliberations, they threw away the niceties of formal political discourse, and came up with a bold, definitive communique that has continued to rattle the country\u2019s political space.\n\nThe three-page communique signed by governors of all the 17 states of the country\u2019s south, including Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Willie Obiano of Anambra, Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom, Seyi Makinde of Oyo; others were Hope Uzodinma of Imo and Ben Ayade of Cross River, who sent representatives, addressed contemporary issues in the polity. Gov. Gbeyega Oyetade of Osun state was away on lesser hajj.\n\nIt made bold calls that have widely resonated with a populace that had begun to lose confidence in their elected leaders amid a barrage of attacks by criminals identified mostly as Fulani herdsmen. But, at the same, it time incurred the rage of Nigeria\u2019s core Northern constituency, which, understandably, saw the move as an attack on its interest. It has set up a debate that many say, could define Nigeria\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cSouthern governors have made us proud! I commend and salute their courage! This is the first step on the road to freedom, equity and justice,\u201d declared former minister of aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode. \u201cThis is the beginning of a new Nigeria and a signal to the world that the South can no longer be taken for granted and has come of age.\u201d\n\nOf the recommendations in the said communique, two have stood out. The ban on open grazing by herders in the entire region and demand for restructuring of the country, both of which have generated heated exchange between the South and the North.\n\nThe governors had said they, \u201cobserved that the incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security. Consequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey noted that \u201cdevelopment and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South. Given this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South (including cattle movement to the South by foot),\u201d while recommending that \u201cthe Federal Government should support WILLING States to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\u201d\n\nOn the thorny issue of restructuring, the governors were unequivocal, even as they called President Muhammadu Buhari out on the lopsided appointments that many say, has characterised his administration since inception in 2015.\n\nAccording to them, they \u201cagreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism.\u201d\n\nThey thus, \u201crecommended that in view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nThe state chief executives further recommended that, \u201cin deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect federal character as Nigerias overall population is heterogenous; and resolved to foster cooperation among the Southern States and the nation at large.\u201d\n\nThe governors\u2019 meeting, first of its kind, is significant on many fronts. It is the first time political leaders of the South will be coming together to present a common demand of Nigeria, a suggestion, observers say, that courtesy of Buhari\u2019s expressly pro-North policies, and his perceived unwillingness to reign in on Fulani bandits perpetrating criminal activities across the country, the South in general, and more importantly, the region\u2019s two most populous groups, the Igbo and the Yoruba, who have historically been political adversaries, have been compelled to close ranks, a scenario they believe, presents huge threat to the existing status quo of Northern domination of the country\u2019s political space.\n\n\u201cIf Buhari had not been president, if his incompetence had not been exposed to the uninitiated, Nigeria would have continued its zigzag path. The one-step-forward, two-steps-backwards trajectory would have continued unabated,\u201d wrote Prof. Akinyemi Onigbinde, Senior Research Fellow, Institute of African Studies, University of Ghana, in a now viral article. \u201cThus, Buhari helped the unrestructured Nigeria to confront its foreseeable future. That is Buharis first legacy.\u201d\n\nOnigbinde argued that it would be impossible for the Nigerian state to fight, successfully, the Yoruba and the Igbo at the same time, and for him, Buhari\u2019s greatest legacy is that he has brought Nigeria to a point where it cannot fight the two groups at the same time.\n\n\u201cAnyone with functioning ears can hear the splitting threads from miles away. High above the deepest part of the valley, Nigeria barely holds on to Buharis back. Two things will happen: Either Nigeria loses its grip on Buharis back and falls into the valley of death, or the rope rips and both Nigeria and Buhari plunge down the valley. Either way, death is the expected end,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cThe only miracle on the horizon is to get Nigeria to a place where it cannot fight the Igbo and the Yoruba nations simultaneously.\n\nAngered by what they perceive as Buhari government\u2019s nepotism, and a general feeling of hidden agenda in the president\u2019s seeming unwillingness to confront bandits killing, kidnapping, raping and displacing communities, separatist tendencies is widely growing across the South.\n\nIn the South West where any talk secession could have been stringently rebuffed five years ago, quest for a separate Oduwa Republic, spearheaded by elder statesman, Prof. Banji Akintoye, is fast gaining momentum.\n\nYoruba nationalist, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho, who achieved prominence earlier in the year for confronting herdsmen accused of perpetrating criminality, particularly in Oyo communities, have since metamorphosed into a separatist activist, leading protest marches to rally support for Oduduwa country in various cities of the South West.\n\nOn Saturday, he was in Oshogbo, the Osun State capital, where he told hundreds of supporters that Oduduwa was not negotiable. According to him, the Yoruba were ready to have their own country, are not intimidated and will not participate in subsequent elections in the country.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be cowed or intimidated. They said I would be arrested. Who would dare do that? We are no longer part of Nigeria. We won\u2019t have anything to do with them again. There is no election again in Yorubaland until we have a Yoruba nation. Those in authority initially thought we were joking when we demanded an independent Yoruba nation,\u201d Igboho declared.\n\n\u201cAll our governors are with us. From Oyo, Ogun and Ondo to Ekiti, Lagos and Osun, they are supporting us, but they can\u2019t do it openly. Allocation they give them in Abuja may stop if they do it openly. So, don\u2019t abuse them again. Governor (Gboyega) Oyetola was informed I will be in Osun and he allowed us to come here. All our monarchs are with us.\n\n\u201cWe are also demanding an immediate end to the prosecution of OPC men that were arrested in Ibarapa land. That is part of the injustice we are talking about. They are still locked up. They didn\u2019t commit any crime. They only stopped and arrested criminals. All the heads of the military, paramilitary and police are Fulani men. We won\u2019t have anything to do with them again.\u201d\n\nIn the South East, the quest for a separate state of Biafra has remained prevalent since the early 2000s. A wing of the agitators under the guise of Eastern Security Network (ESN), a branch of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), have since taken up arms, ostensibly to drive away criminal herdsmen inhabiting forests and bushes in the region, from where they launch attacks on communities.\n\nBoth groups have since closed ranks. And with separatist agitations gathering momentum in both regions of the South, observers say it would be nearly impossible for Nigerian state to confront both at the same time, even as the move by the governors is understood to be a desperate attempt to seek to address some of the underlying issues in order to avoid the worst.\n\n\u201cIn a one-on-one fight, Nigeria may defeat any of its components. Nigeria may defeat the Igbo. Nigeria may run over the Yoruba, argued Onigbinde. \u201cNigeria cannot defeat the Igbo and the Yoruba at the same time. In a fight between Nigeria on one side and an Igbo-Yoruba alliance on the other, many ethnic minority groups will take the side of the alliance.\u201d\n\nAs may have been expected, however, the governors\u2019 resolution is has continued to attract backlash from some individuals in the North, even as they have continued to receive support from the South, in what has since turned into a North versus South brickbat.\n\nFormer vice president and presidential hopeful, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, from Adamawa, North East, was more statesmanly in his response. In a statement on Sunday, he pointed noted that the underlying reasons for the governor\u2019s meeting was understandable, as he admitted that the country was fast drifting, but argued that they cannot solve the problem by promoting \u2018region\u2019 as opposed to \u2018national.\u2019\n\n\u201cGovernors representing some states have met. And I completely understand the necessity of their meeting and the wisdom of their decisions. But no matter how much you try to clap with one hand, the vibrations will not be the same as when you clap with two hands,\u201d Atiku said.\n\n\u201cWe have a national challenge. And as Albert Einstein said, \u201cWe cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\u201d These problems were created by those with a regional mindset, and will not be solved by those with a similar mindset.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president, who ran a presidential campaign under the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019 on the plank of restructuring, has however, received backlash, by many who pointed out that he never preached same message to Northern governors who had been meeting and taking positions on national issues for ages, and never thought it necessary to speak up when the Buhari government decided to back Dr. Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Communications Minister, busted for showing support for terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cThere has been Northern gov\u2019s forum since I can remember. Just one southern gov\u2019s meeting and you\u2019re sewing thread,\u201d said Twitter user, @_Soludo\n\nThere has been Northern gov's forum since I can remember. Just one southern gov's meeting and you're sewing thread like obioma. Ndi uchu https://t.co/O4X4yoWGzY \u2014 SOLUDO (@_Soludo) May 17, 2021\n\n\u201cAtiku and his selective opposition tweets. When @DrIsaPantami was exposed for his extreme views, he was silent,\u201d pointed out another user, Adetutu Balogun, MBA @Tutsy22.\n\nBut other individuals from the North been more confrontational in their response. Last week, Borno South senator, Ali Ndume, insisted that the ban on open grazing could not stand, as according to him, The governors are deviating from the matter. The problem is not about open grazing. The problem is security. Most of the insecurity problem confronting Nigeria is not in the bush.\u201d\n\nProf. Usman Yusuf, former executive secretary and chief executive officer of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), insisted that the governors cannot take a decision on open grazing without consulting the herders.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the apex Northern socio-political group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), in a statement by its spokesperson, Emmanuel Yawe, while agreeing with the ban on open grazing, argued that the call for restructuring was tantamount to asking for the breakup of the country.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Keffi, Nasarawa State same Thursday, Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, and former governor of the state, Abdullahi Adamu, accused the governors of betrayal and of playing to the gallery with their demand for restructuring.\n\nThe recent meeting of the Southern Governors Forum is an act of betrayal of the trust Nigerians reposed in them. Each governor pledged and swore to an oath and they emphasised loyalty to the sovereignty of this country. They also pledged their loyalty to the President of the country. Thats their oath of office,\u201d said Adamu.\n\nWhile we accept the fact that we have freedom of association and freedom of expression as citizens, they have failed to express their views through the right channel. They are members of the National Council of State. Every governor is a member of the NCS. It also included former presidents who are still living.\n\nThere is no better forum at their level to take a joint decision than such a forum. The fact that they have taken a decision as a divisive move does not speak well of their intention. I feel it is a betrayal of trust. I think they are just playing to the gallery.\n\nSame Thursday, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, while speaking to state house correspondents, insisted that the governors were wrong in advising Buhari to restructure the country, when, according to him, they have not allowed restructuring in their states.\n\nLawan went on to advise the governors against joining the agitations for secession or calling for restructuring of the country.\n\nThe call for secession or the call for restructuring many are genuine calls even though I never believe that someone who is calling for secession means well or is a misguided person,\u201d he said. But I believe that when somebody calls for improving the structure that we have is a genuine call.\n\nBut I want to advice here, I believe that as leaders those of us who were elected must not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing because even if you are a governor you are supposed to be working hard in your state to ensure that this restructuring you are calling for at the federal level you have done it in your state as well.\n\nThis is because what you may accuse the federal government of whatever it is, you may also be accused of the same thing in your state. So, we are supposed to ensure that we have a complete and total way of ensuring that our systems at the federal, state and even local government work for the people, and that we allow people to participate in governance so that whoever feels that he has something to offer to make Nigeria better does so freely without any hindrance.\n\nThe Senate President had since gotten a dose of his own medicine from his fellow lawmakers, notably from the House of Representatives, who reminded him that the country could not continue to do the same thing and expect a different result.\n\nLawmakers from the South, notably Southern senators, have also thrown their weight behind the governors, part of a growing solidarity in a region seemingly determined to make its own case in faltering union, gradually caving to mounting insecurity.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, jointly signed by its Chairman, Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti); Secretary General, Matthew Urhoghide (Edo) and Publicity Secretary, Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu), Southern senators forum, consisting of senators from all political parties from the region, hailed the governors \u201cfor ruminating on the expediency and the need for speedy restructuring of the highly lopsided Nigerian nation, saying this will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\u201d\n\nThe senators noted that pursuing equity and justice, will wipe out ethnic tension, restore peace and stability and ward off agitations for secession that are now gaining tractions across the land.\n\nThe senators equally noted that the deft and unanimous policy of the ban on open cattle grazing would help in reining in those hiding under cattle grazing to unleash terror of kidnapping and killing on the residents of the region. They applauded the step taken by the Governors, saying it would serve as a buffer to wanton destruction of farmlands, kidnappings and carnages.\n\nThe Senators lamented how the Southern farmers were losing hundreds of millions of Naira to plundering of food crops through encroachments on farmlands and exposing the region to famine and acute food scarcity.\n\nAt this critical point of our national life when the economy was being bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens, the senators said.\n\nAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\nMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping, raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\nWith this uniform resolve by our Governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigerias amalgamation in 1914.\u201d\n\nSupport also came the way of the governors, from their Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom, whose state, as well the rest of the Middle Belt, has witnessed most attacks from the herders. Ortom who was the first governor to ban open grazing, stated that his southern colleagues had made the right move, while arguing that those opposing their decision, have hidden agenda.\n\nSupport have equally come from the apex Igbo socio cultural group, Ohanaeze, and leading Yoruba group, Afenifere, including such other groups as Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the Coalition of Southern Groups (CSG).\n\nSpeaking at during Afenifere meeting held at his Ogbo residence in Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State, the group\u2019s leader, PA Ayo Adebanjo, said Buhari should ensure Nigeria is restructured before the next election, as according to him there must be a country before an election.\n\nThe governors\u2019 resolution, has further emboldened the South, and escalated the debate on Nigeria\u2019s future. Still, amid the backlash that has greeted it from the North; the governors say it\u2019s only the beginning and that their resolution is sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cThe meeting has started, and it\u2019s going to go ahead.\u201dDeclared Ondo State governor and convener of the forum while appearing in Arise TV on Friday, said \u201cWhat we said is very clear, that in all Southern states, there is a ban on open grazing. We will do a former letter to Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe are also discussing with our legislators, we want to build elite consensus. Buhari has to listen to us. The number of governors involved is not something you can push aside.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, at a civic reception organized in his honour by the Ogoni Ethnic Nationality of Rivers State in Bori, headquarters of Khana Local Government Area on Saturday, the state governor, Wike said the decision ban open grazing was cast in stone, maintaining that Southerners cannot be second class citizens in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLook, I have been in government, I am in opposition, nobody can cow me. Magnus (Abe), they know, their government cannot cow me. I will say what I will say and I will do what is right for my people. Nobody will anything to me. I will die the day God says it is my day. Nobody can take my life when it is not time for me to die. So, let nobody be afraid,\u201d Wike said.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to say, all those who are saying why should Southern Governors ban grazing \u2013 I have taken further steps to fulfill what the Southern Governors said in Asaba. If anybody wants to die, go and die and hang yourself on electric pole.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a position and we are not going back. Enough is enough; we are not second class of citizens of this country. We also own this country and we must partake in what is happening in this country.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Delta governor, Okowa, while addressing party members in Asaba at the weekend, maintained that the ban was sacrosanct, even as he said their for devolution of powers was most in order.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard a lot about the southern governors meeting. We thank God for that meeting. We thank God for bringing us together. The things that we said aren\u2019t new. We\u2019re only re-echoing what our people have been agitating for,\u201d Okowa said.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately I read that somebody said we ought not to talk about certain things as elected people. If the voice of your people is out always and as an elected person you shy away from giving further voice to their voices, then you ought not to be in the position you occupy.\n\n\u201cSo, I thank our people in the House of Reps who have responded to the speech made by their colleagues,\u201d he enthused.\n\nOkowa argued that there was no reason for any region or individual to be afraid of the governors\u2019 stance as a non-issue relating to dismembering the country was discussed at the forum.\n\n\u201cAs I did say, there\u2019s none of the things we\u2019ve discussed that\u2019s against the unity of this country. We believe in the unity of our country as elected leaders. But we also went ahead to advance for some things that must be done to give strength to the unity.\n\n\u201cWe talked about restructuring which has been on the table for too long. Both the voices of the PDP and the APC have been on restructuring.\n\n\u201cAnd restructuring is all-inclusive and all-encompassing. We all have different views on it. But when we all sit at a round table, we\u2019ll agree on what\u2019s best for us all.\n\n\u201cThe conversations have started and our people are talking and when we do not give backing to their voices, then we\u2019re giving room for further crisis.\n\n\u201cOther leaders should thank the southern governors for giving further voices to the conversation which can bring about a country with fairness, equity and trust among the people,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAlso affirming the stance, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia at the weekend, reiterated the state\u2019s commitment to enforce the ban on open grazing of cattle in Abia.\n\nThe governor who spoke during a zoom meeting with newsmen of Abia extraction under the aegis of Abia Media Forum, said that a bill was already in place to enforce the ban and to check the activities of criminal elements disguising as nomads.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the point of making sure that we enforce and implement it and even in doing that I must also share what I see as a challenge to the enforcement of that law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe law is in place and we are taking steps to enforce it. It has become imperative that we enforce that law strictly because we just noticed that we have big time trouble in our hands.\n\n\u201cWe have those that we refer to as criminal herdsmen; they are different from the ordinary herdsmen that we have been living with all these years. We now have in our mist bandits that have infiltrated from the rest of West Africa and other parts of Africa and their assignment is to come here rape, kill and kidnap people for money. It is now very imperative that we enforce that law,\u2019\u2019 he added",

          "text": "Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has said his administration is prioritizing the needs of the people in terms of infrastructure development of the state.\n\nThe governor made this known during a zoom meeting organized by the Abia Media Forum.\n\nAccording to him, resources of the state must be properly channeled to address fundamental needs of the people. He further stressed the importance of a dry port at Ntigha to facilitate ease of doing business in Aba and the state at large. Governor Ikpeazu who said the state will not embark on building an airport just to impress people simply because other States in the region have done so stated that \u201cwe are looking at viability here, economy is key. Only about 5% of our population have interest in flying while the other 95% use road to move their goods and services.\n\n\u201cWe must look at the needs of our people before embarking on any project\u201d, he said.\n\nThe governor also said his administration is working closely with sister States to address the issue of insecurity in the region. He reiterated the importance of the Ebubeagu Security outfit and said it would help address the security challenges faced in the region.\n\nHe noted that the idea behind the Ebubeagu Security outfit is to collaborate and maximize the comparative advantage in each state of the region, enable the region procure modern technology to facilitate monitoring of movement of persons and to effectively tackle the challenges headlong. Dr. Ikpeazu said the launch of the new security outfit couldn\u2019t have come at a better time and that the State already had in place the Homeland Security Unit with a mandate to protect lives and property of people of the State.\n\nWhile stating that the state was deepening the Ebubeagu security outfit by recruiting at the ward and community levels citizens who would help in the area of information and intelligence gathering at the grassroots level, the State Chief Executive said \u201cthe State will soon organize a stakeholders forum which will have in attendance all stakeholders in the security sector.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing together stakeholders in the security sector to help us evaluate the template we have; this will enable us tackle the security challenges we are faced with. Our target is to create a security architecture robust enough to secure our state.\u201d\n\nWhile addressing the issue of criminal herdsmen in the State, the Governor said his administration took proactive measure by enacting a bill through the State Assembly to ban open grazing in the State. This he said has helped the state in addressing the issue of herders and farmers clashes in the State.\n\n\u201cWe have a law on open grazing. Aside Benue State, Abia was the first to pass the Anti-Open Grazing law in the country. We are tackling criminal herdsmen from other parts of the country and sub-region. We are enforcing the law\u201d, he said.\n\nHe called for the decentralization of the nation\u2019s security architecture and the creation of State Police to enable states tackle their peculiar challenges.\n\nWhile reiterating the need to address the issue of perceived injustice in the country, the Governor said there are complaints of injustice, lopsidedness in appointments, lack of consideration of the feelings of those occupying the Nigerian territory in critical decision making of the country etc, he called for inclusiveness in the appointment of personnel: For example, in our security architecture of the country, the southeast doesn\u2019t have any security representative in the security council meeting. There is a need to have an all inclusive government in order to assuage the feelings of those agitating.\u201d\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu used the occasion to reiterate his government\u2019s mission to leave Abia State better than he met it. \u201cI want to be remembered as someone who came and tackled intractable issues; I want to be remembered as the Governor who tackled unworkable roads like Faulks, Ama Ikonne, and the governor who added to the road infrastructural stock of the state.\n\n\u201cMost of the roads we constructed are still standing and would stand the test of time. We have affected positively all facet of state infrastructure: education, health care, road, agriculture, SME, etc. Our aim is to leave the state better than we met it,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe Tony Elumelu-led Heirs Oil & Gas (HHOG), recently strengthened the pursuit of its leadership goal in the Nigerian Oil & Gas sector with assemblage of industry figures, with decades of considerable global and regional experience.\n\nThe move which saw the appointment of OsayandeIgieho, a former vice-president of Royal Dutch Shell in Hague, Netherlands and former chairman and CEO of Shell Garbon, as Chief Executive Officer, effective May 4, also announced a non-executive board, with Elumelu himself as chairman.\n\nThis comes barely four months after Heirs Holdings Limited\u2019s (HH) portfolio company, HHOG, completed the acquisition of OML17 in January 2021, in one of the largest oil and gas financings in Africa in more than a decade, with a financing component of US$1.1 billion.\n\nThe transaction represents a further implementation of the HH Group strategy of creating the leading integrated energy business in Africa through a series of strategic portfolio holdings.\n\nShell had announced in 2018 its plan to put certain Nigerian assets under review, including the OML17 block. Elumelu, who was already a favourite candidate at the time, has since raised the necessary funds to expand his oil and gas assets.\n\nKnown for his activities in the field of power generation, Elumelu is already present through various companies in the upstream oil sector. Transcorp thus operates in association with Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) the small onshore block OPL 281.\n\nTenoil, a subsidiary of Heirs, also owns the marginal Ata field, which is expected to come on stream soon (3,500 barrels per day expected by mid-2021).\n\nA capacity of 27,000 barrels/day\n\nShell, through its Nigerian subsidiary SPDC, was the operator of the license, which is also 55% owned by the NNPC. The operation was carried out through TNOG Oil & Gas Limited, a subsidiary of the two main groups in the Elumelu\u2019s galaxy, namely the private company Heirs Holding and the Transcorp group listed on the floor of the Nigeria Stock Exchange.\n\nThe OML 17 block, which holds oil and gas reserves, has a production capacity of 27,000 barrels/day. Its 2P reserves (proved and potential) amount to 1.2 billion barrels, according to TNOG. It has 15 gas and oil wells, six of which are producing, according to Wood Mackenzie, a research company.\n\nDominated by the NNPC, the local Nigerian oil sector has about twenty domestic operators ensuring (before the Covid-19 crisis) about 20% of the production of the country with, among its leaders, Aiteo Eastern E&P Co (Benedict Peters) or Seplat.\n\nElumelu\u2019s transactions have already received the approval of the government of President MuhammaduBuhari. For several years, the federal government faced with the stagnation of the country\u2019s production and the inefficiency of NNPC, have been pushing through various measures to increase the local content of projects as well as structure the private oil sector. This goal has been reaffirmed several times in recent months by Minister of Petroleum, Timipre Sylva.\n\nNigeria\u2019s overall long-term objective is to reach a production of 4 million barrels per day, a very old target that has never been met. At the beginning of 2020, the country was producing only 1.76 million barrels per day, a figure that has since fallen to 1.4 million barrels due to the global crisis.\n\nTo boost the sector, Nigeria is finalizing a new Petroleum Industry Bill, currently under final discussion at the National Assembly. While international companies have made heavy investments in recent years in the Nigerian offshore, the reform of the sector comes against the backdrop of a certain disengagement of these operators from onshore blocks, as in the case of the sale of OML17 by Shell, Total and ENI.\n\nTaming the gangs\n\nMr. Elumelu is not unmindful the risk associated onshore asset of this nature in terms of security and compliance in a region marked by sporadic actions of armed groups. The Niger Delta region is also known for its frequent environmental problems, often linked to the actions of armed gangs or smugglers.\n\nLittle wonder in a tweet commenting on his acquisition of OML17 Elumelu stated that \u201cas a native of the Delta, I have always believed that the region deserves better (\u2026). With TNOG our approach to Afrocapitalism underlines our commitment to inclusive development and shared prosperity with our host communities.\u201d\n\nFor oil analyst Antony Goldman, the opportunity ahead is for Tony Elumelu to \u201cshow a capacity for managing costs, transparency and environmental and community issues that ultimately make the licence unattractive for Shell and its partners.\u201d\n\nBut Chief Executive Officer of Heirs Oil and Gas, Samuel Nwanze, believes those risks can be mitigated by diversification into other parts of the energy sector.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the Nigerian economy means that it continues to be reliant on oil \u2013 and truly, we need to get power, robust, accessible, reliable, and plentiful, to industries, to services and to consumers. This is why our Group has developed the largest installed electricity production capacity in Nigeria, the recent purchases of the Afam Power Plants, our turnaround of the Transcorp Power Plant, our work on our other oil and gas assets, all leading to a single goal \u2013 sustainable, robust, and widely available power, that will drive schools, hospitals, and industries,\u201d Nwanze told the media.\n\n\u201cWe were leading supporters of President Obama\u2019s \u2018Power African Initiative\u2019 where Heirs Holdings committed $2.5bn to increase affordable and accessible power in Africa and was the single largest private sector investor in this initiative \u2013 and we welcome the Biden Administration\u2019s renewed focus on Africa.\n\n\u201cOn the oil price, we cannot predict \u2013 what we are focused on is ensuring that we have a business which is sustainable, creating economic and social wealth and delivering on our strategy to power Africa.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier written statement, Elumelu stated that: \u201cThe acquisition of such a high-quality asset, with significant potential for further growth, is a strong statement of our confidence in Nigeria, the Nigerian oil and gas sector\u2026We see significant benefits from integrating our production, with our ability to power Nigeria, through Transcorp, and deliver value across the energy value chain.\u201d\n\nThe team\n\nThe MD, Igiehon joins from the Royal Dutch Shell (Shell), where he was previously a vice-president with the Group in the Hague, He brings over 27 years of experience and expertise in the oil and gas sector with Shell, where he held a series of senior management positions.\n\nMr. Igiehon previously served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Shell Gabon, where he led the successful turnaround of the operational, safety and financial performance.\n\nThe Board of HHOG is made up of distinguished private sector and senior industry leaders. Tony O. Elumelu, who serves as the chairman is also the Chairman of Heirs Holdings, the United Bank for Africa (UBA), Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp), and Founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\n\nSally Udoma previously served as general counsel for Chevron Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East Exploration and Production. She was general counsel for Sasol Chevron Consulting Limited and managing counsel at the London Legal Service Centre for Chevron Global Upstream and Gas. She has also served as general counsel and general manager for Chevron Nigeria Limited.\n\nAnil Dua is a founding partner at Gateway Partners Limited, a private equity fund specialising in dynamic growth markets, including Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Prior to this, Mr. Dua worked for over 35 years with Standard Chartered Bank in Asia, Africa, Europe and the US, where he held various roles, including Regional CEO West Africa and Regional Head of Origination and Client Coverage, Africa.\n\nAhmadu Kida Musa, who previously served as Deputy Managing Director of Total Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited, has over 32 years of experience in the Oil and Gas industry and brings considerable expertise in Nigerian oil and gas.\n\nStanley Lawson currently serves on the board of Transcorp. He is Managing Partner at Financial Advisory & Investment Consultants Ltd. Dr Lawson previously occupied the position of Group Executive Director-Finance & Accounts at NNPC.\n\nSamuel Nwanze is the Chief Finance Officer at Heirs Oil and Gas.

          "title": "Adefarasin\u2019s Plan B and elite illusion",
          "text": "By Uche Chris\n\nNigerian elite do not stop to amaze me; often their words and action give clear indication of how removed they are from reality and their inconsideration and lack of empathy for the people they supposedly lead. Usually our pastime is the political elite who serve themselves and only remember the people during elections for their votes. So the enemies of the people are the politicians who we all love to hate because of our envy of their new status of power and wealth, and many would easily trade positions with them if given the slightest opportunity.\n\nEven the preachers have found a new subject for popular sermons: Politician and the political crisis in the country. Preachers have become the unofficial opposition to the ills of politicians. A burial of an Ambassador last week in Ibadan proved this point: Virtually most people in the church were indifferent to the powerful sermon by the Anglican Bishop until he turned to the subject of thieving politicians and divine judgment awaiting them. Suddenly, the \u2018Amen\u2019 was ear-piercing.\n\nLast week\u2019s viral video of Pastor Paul Adefarasin of the House on the Rock church fits into this narrative. The man of God had in the video admonished his congregation and anybody, who cares to listen, after a careful review of the growing insecurity in the country, to develop a Plan B for surviving the Nigeria situation. Our situation is becoming so dire and intolerable that people should prepare to relocate to any other country around us for the peace and safety of their lives.\n\nComing from such a respected and high brow preacher makes the suggestion not only insensitive and perplexing, but indeed laughable. Comically, the suggestion may be the result of exasperation and impatience with the state of the nation and the indifference and incapacity of the government to deal decisively with it for whatever reasons.\n\nObviously most people are already fed up with the worsening situation, and desire an immediate response to halt further degeneration, as southern governors expressed last week after a meeting in Asaba Delta State.\n\nHowever, Pastor Adefarasin\u2019s Plan B is nothing but a disingenuous flight of faith and political cowardice. As a pastor and preacher of the gospel, he is not the expected person to advise such political capitulation and escapism from a problem that is both religious and political in nature. So, where is his faith in urging people to flee to neighbouring countries which are engrossed in even worse situations than Nigeria?\n\nIf every Nigerian were to leave the country for the marauders who are seeking to conquer the land, who would be there to defend it? He wants us to escape because we don\u2019t want to die for our ancestral homes; yet we will return to inherit a country built on the blood of others. That is not only selfish but amoral; and completely unbecoming of a pastor.\n\nWhile other pastors and preachers, such as Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, President of CAN, Bishop David Oyedepo, and even Rev. Father Mabkah, are challenging the government publicly at the risk to their lives and reputation, as their vocation demands, Adefarasin is asking us to become refugees in other countries, rather fighting to salvage ours. This is very curious.\n\nAt least, he could ask us to pray; or has God stopped answering prayers? Has Nigeria\u2019s situation become so irredeemably hopeless that we should all pull stakes? There are dozens of countries even in Africa, which are not comparable in terms of social, economic and political conditions to Nigeria. Somalia has been on the violent boil for over 30 years, yet they are still hopeful of a resolution. Hope is the ultimate expression of faith, because faith without hope is useless \u2013 hope does not make ashamed.\n\nIt may be argued that he who fights and runs away lives to fight another day. But what if there is no other day to resume the unfinished fight? Nigeria is facing an existential threat and it is a once in a lifetime fight. Christians desire that Nigeria should remain a secular and multi-religious nation, but they have to fight for it; otherwise, they will lose both and there will be no second chance to fight for them. We should look at the history of Christianity in Africa and determine the future before us. As late Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro once declared, \u201cThis is the only country we have\u2026\u201d\n\nAbout 1000 years ago the entire North Africa was Christian; even in the last century, Turkey and entire Eastern Europe, where Apostle Paul spent most of his ministry life, was Christian. Lebanon in my life time was Christian; today a Christian can never run the country again. Unless Christianity does not mean anything to Pastor Paul Adefarasin other than amassing wealth and building a huge cathedral, then his call for exodus of Christians from Nigeria is ungodly and irresponsible.\n\nIt means he does not understand the issues at stake and is only concerned with self preservation. After serving his God, does it bother him that his child may not be free to do so? Or is he among those who still deluded themselves that there is no religious agenda in the crisis? His position reflects the inanity and egotism of the Nigerian elite who are generally amoral and bereft of higher principles and ideals of better society.\n\nIt shows generally that a Nigerian is a Nigerian regardless of what he professes. Although this is not to paint everybody with a tar brush, but the fact remains that there are bad Nigerians in the church as there are also in politics; and he that is without sin let him cast the first stone. Come to think of it, how many Nigerians can afford to escape to another country in the present economic situation?\n\nPastor Paul does not know this because the church guarantees his income every Sunday. As one born with silver spoon, he may not understand what poverty looks like because he has never experienced it. Majority of the members of his church who come every Sunday to offer their Widow\u2019s mite, are having sleepless nights on how to pay rent, school fees and even feed themselves.\n\nThis is the Nigerian situation and his Plan B is an illusion of which only very few can dream.",

          "text": "Adamu Garba, a former presidential candidate, claims that cattle are worth more than the entire oil and gas reserve in Southern Nigeria.\n\nGarba made the statement in response to the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Bauchi State Branch, which advised its members to leave 17 southern Nigerian states.\n\nREAD ALSO: DSS operatives clash with Sunday Igboho\u2019s supporters in Ataoja\u2019s palace\n\nMACBAN gave the advice following a ban on open grazing issued by governors of the region after a meeting in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nReacting, Garba said on Twitter, \u201cI perfectly agree with this proposal. All Fulani present in Southern Nigeria should come back. We shall use the cattle, process the resources, and sell all over the world as finished goods.\n\n\u201cCattle have more economic value than the entire oil and gas reserve we have in Nigeria. Our major stakeholders in the North must admit cows as business opportunities not just culture & invest heavily to bring #CowToCurrency to reality. Cows alone can solve all Northen problems.\n\n\u201cThe job opportunities, the manufacturing centers, & the connection to global hubs of demands for the best cattle meats can open more doors and set for the liberation of Northern Nigeria from cheap and somewhat, useless oil assets. We must invest in harvesting the value of cattle.\n\n\u201cA litter of Cow at N350 is much more than the value of a litre of oil at N145. With over 20 million cows, take 1/3 as milk-producing female on average of 5 litres a day, we\u2019ll have almost N12Bn/day from cow milk. That\u2019s about N700M/state/day. About N21Bn/State/Month.\n\n\u201cThat is much higher than the Monthly Allocation the largest state receives in the North. Again, each cow can generate a minimum of 3 Jobs. Rearing, Slughtring, Processing, marketing, Selling, and management. 5M cows =15M jobs. I marvel at the laziness of Northern Governors.\n\n\u201cNorthern Governors think awarding contracts for building roads, taking their cuts is all they need for themselves. Doing so has subjected the North to condescension and dehumanization from some elements in the South. The time is now for them to wake up to our potentials.\n\n\u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that the 2023 election is a game between cattle states and non-cattle states. Let\u2019s be blunt about this. If Northern leaders do not wake up to this urgent reality, the target will not just be the cow, but the cow harboring states and their adherents.\u201d",

And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019ll continue to do until everybody is free and until every corrupt individual is either in the grave or be hanged or is in the prison.\n\n\u201cThe difference between us and some of you is that when we say things, we do it. But, you there keep grumbling and murmuring \u2018things are bad o, things are bad.\u2019 We are to make our dreams a reality, not because we are better than any other person but because Elohim is on the throne.\n\n\u201cMiyetti Allah was a full fledged terror group n Ebonyi, but IPOB and ESN drove them out, that\u2019s why the DSS (Department of State Services) is labelling ESN a terrorist group, because we forbade Fulani murderers on our ancestral lands.\n\n\u201cAnd before I came on air this evening, I had confirmation that they are now in Lagos. That was what they were cleverly trying to disguise as IPOB attacks on Lagos. I want to let you understand that if I tell you that we have a terror group in Lagos, you\u2019ll marvel,\u201d Kanu said.\n\nWhen he also spoke about the meeting of the Southern Governors who unanimously prohibited open grazing in their respective states, Kanu said the IPOB and ESN will begin to restrict the oppression of their members by the DSS.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to tag the ESN terror group. Why? Because we defeated them in the East. We rendered them useless. Because of the work that Eastern Security Network did in the past, is doing now and will continue to do.\n\n\u201cThat is the why the southern governors came together only last week to announce a ban on open grazing. To try for the very first time in their life to confront head-on this Fulani Islamic hegemony as a result of the bravery and sacrifice of the Eastern Security Network.\n\n\u201cEvery DSS office that we know must be placed under surveillance and we must begin to deal with them as we lay our hands on them,\u201d Kanu said.",

          "title": "Dami Duro to FEM: Analysing Davido\u2019s 10 years of making smashing hits back to back",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nTen years ago, an 18-year-old stormed the Nigerian music industry with \u2018Back When\u2019 and \u2018Dami Duro\u2019 tracks that swept across Africa.\n\nFor many, it seemed like the regular case of a new artiste hitting luck in quick succession. But for those who had known the teenage sensation, this was the birth of a new star.\n\nThe first track, \u201cBack When\u201d was a faux attempt to explore a struggle narrative. But fortunately, David Adeleke redirected his narrative and embraced his privileged status with Dami Duro.\n\nAnd \u201cDami Duro\u201d, co-produced by Shizzi, was the perfect introduction to Davido. As one from an affluent family, his background afforded him the leeway to pursue music as a hobbie, but with Dami Duro, Davido stood in our faces, shouting at the top of his lungs \u201cI am from a rich family, I own my representation and no one can stop me\u201d\n\n10 years on, and Davido has walked the talk. He has had an enviable career laden with multiple hit tracks and lots of real awards to brag with.\n\nDavido\u2019s story is one that deserves to be told and this week, NewsWireNGR had a chat with Obinna Agwu, a music executive and talent manager to analyse Davido\u2019s success and detail how his career has been a win for the Afrobeats community.\n\nWhat is the Afrobeat genre?\n\nThere\u2019s Afrobeat and there\u2019s Afrobeats. Afrobeat without the \u2018S\u2019 is the music that Fela worked tirelessly to develop over a long period. From his own band Koola Lobitos to finally refining it to where he started Egypt 80 and everything, and it was because he schooled out there in the West, he took in a lot of their sound and all of that. But at some point, Fela felt the need to really stand apart from the music he had learnt and he wanted to make it more African than more make it more authentic.\n\nSo Afrobeat is the music today that emerged from the genius who spent tireless time in developing and working on it in the 60s.\n\nSo now to the Afrobeats with the \u2018S\u2019. A lot of people are going to say to you that unlike Afrobeat that is a distinct sound with elements, Afrobeats music isn\u2019t particularly a genre. It is just the overarching umbrella sound of the music out of West Africa.\n\nAnother funny thing is that the word Afrobeat was first coined or used by a Ghanaian-based DJ in the UK called DJ Atlantic. He was on radio at a time, and he had a show on a certain radio station and at that point he introduced a lot of African music. I guess after some time he felt the need to call it something, so that\u2019s where Afrobeat came from. Afrobeat is pretty much a sound from West Africa, the overarching sound of the umbrella music from West Africa.\n\nAfrobeats looks like the biggest export from Africa to the world right now, can give us a rundown of the evolution of the genre?\n\nWhen you talk about Afrobeats music, there are a lot of elements and a lot of people to thank. For example In 2005, people like MTV Base made their entry into Nigeria and to Africa. What those platforms did was that they gave us an avenue to expose our music to a bigger and wider audience within Africa and the world.\n\nHowever, at that time what we know as Afrobeats hasn\u2019t quite started to happen so at that time We had the 9ice, we had the P-Square, Naeto C, Ikechukwu, Mo\u2019 Hits, MI and all these people things, so as our music continued to grow I would say it was in early 2010 that Afrobeat started to form and shape up into something, especially with people like Wizkid, and there\u2019s really no way we would talk about Afrobeat victory without bringing the UK into it.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately because the UK ended up playing a huge role that helped in disseminating the sound support, and it was very obvious because we have a lot of Nigerians out there, a lot of Africans out there. So the UK is really much like an annex of Africa, so the UK and the regions of the UK and the people of the UK definitely played the huge role in helping to disseminate the sound support just like in everything, as you start to earn success, more people want to tap in, more people want to understand what you\u2019re doing. So before we knew it people like Drake came in and wanted to do stuff, J Hus plenty people, Skepta, so many people started to identify with the sound and these people came with their own huge following and their own audience. I\u2019d say that Afrobeat as a sound or as a musical consciousness , pretty much started in the 2010s and yes, we are like ten years deep into all of that now. So shout-out to Davido, shout out to Wizkid , shout to all these people who helped to push the sounds up.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Afrobeats rise without mentioning Davido, a man who recently clocks a decade in the industry. What do you think has defined his career so far in the industry?\n\nResilience and Passion. At the initial stage a lot of people did not consider David to be the most obviously talented person.\n\nBut one thing you could tell from David was that this kid was hungry, this kid wanted this thing, this Kid is going to do anything to get it , as God would have it he seems to have financial support on his path, but why I would not talk so much about that is that before David and even after David, we have seen a lot of rich kid , right? So money is not the only reason David is such a star. As a manager and an administrator, I have run with people who have money but their money is for their lifestyle and it\u2019s not for the music and when it\u2019s time to invest in music they would not, but with David , David realised that okay, I have the wherewithal to do what I need to do, he really put his money where his mouth is and he went all out for it.\n\nSo I would say resilience and passion first of all and over time we have seen this guy improve and get better and better. So it\u2019s not hard to say that David has been growing because over time he has shown us that.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Davido has undergone a lot of evolution to stay relevant. What has been the biggest?\n\nFor me, his biggest evolution has been his ability to spot great songs. His ability to work with amazingly gifted people and you must understand that sometimes these people are not necessarily the most affordable people to work it but David has displayed creative maturity over time.\n\nIn Nigeria a lot of people at his level wouldn\u2019t be open to come and say \u2018somebody wrote this song with me, or I took the song from somebody\u2019. But, we have seen David do that from time to time . From \u2018Gobe\u2019 to T Spize that wrote \u2018Aye\u2019 to collaborating with Peruzzi on a lot of songs, to working with Adekunle Gold on One Milli , so you can tell that David has a mentality that a lot of his peers and people do not have.\n\nHe is open , he understands music, he goes to a place and hears a song and says Yo, this song, I want this song, I need to sing this song, I would buy this song off you, what is it going to take , so over time David has shown that he is an incredible Musician and he has the ear for good music and also likes working with with gifted people.\n\nA lot of people say his special sauce is creating monster hits, how true is this? And how easy is it?\n\nHis special sauce is recognising monster hit, so when somebody tries to downplay David\u2019s greatness and say he is not talented, I\u2019m like yoo, it takes a lot of talent to spot hit, it was this boy who spotted \u2018Gobe\u2019 and he bought it, this guy who spotted \u2018Aye\u2019, and he bought it, he spotted even \u2018Fem\u2019.\n\nHe said some people were working at his studio, the song was not even meant for him, he now pulled up, he heard it and he was like yoo I\u2019m using this work, it takes talent to be able to spot those things you know and the ability to collaborate with very gifted people, all these things are talent, these are things his father\u2019s money cannot afford him. So yeah, Davido definitely has superpower for creating songs that are amazing.\n\n\u2018IF\u2019 was written by Tekno so you can tell that this guy is actually steps ahead of his peers. He is able to collaborate with the right people and he is able to spot amazing songs and say so you know what we are going to do with this one.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference in delivery even when one buy songs\n\nDefinitely, and he does that well. Like \u2018Gobe\u2019, he ended up not using the actual beat and he got.bI think he got Chizzi, and David has done so many things like this with his songs. So you can tell that this guy really has something, he knows something, something that can\u2019t just be learnt, something his father\u2019s money can\u2019t buy.\n\nWhat other elements of music marketing has Davido mastered to keep him going for over ten years?\n\nI think his use of social media has been very impressive over the years and that\u2019s why If I am not mistaken I think he even has more followers than Wizkid on Instagram.\n\nThat says a lot because Wizkid is quite a superstar. But for some reason, that followers count means that more people are trying to see something on David\u2019s side than on Wiz\u2019s side and it\u2019s just that when people love you and they admire you , they want to know more about you and David let\u2019s you in. You see his friends, you see his travels, you see his kids and even when he\u2019s ranting he puts it up there and another thing, David is so giving off his platform, that\u2019s something we have seen over time, I\u2019ve seen and then when he sees something that\u2019s amazing, he is always making sure he finds a way behind it through his platform I think in some way these things get to people and they love you more and support you.\n\nAlso, David is actually a businessman and he is very clinical about these things. If you get on YouTube and say you want to sit down and watch David\u2019s videos, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time there. And you know that these videos are shot by Clarence Peters. If you put it into naira and kobo, you would see that we are talking about hundreds of millions so a lot of people make money and they struggle putting that money back into their business but not David.\n\nHe\u2019s a great businessman and his use of social media has been very impressive and he has a heart of working with the right people.\n\nA lot of people have pointed at his humility in recalling Asa, as a key moment in his career\n\nYou see what he displayed, these are the things people love about David. David\u2019s ability to be honest and to just come out of a situation and say this is what it is.\n\nLike the project he did with Sony, that international project, David would openly say to you, I don\u2019t like that project, that project carries my name but I do not like it, I don\u2019t think it was me, I don\u2019t think I was allowed to do what I really wanted to do. It\u2019s not a lot of artistes who are able to look at their work and say ohhh I do not like this work .\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big level of honesty and sincerity and I think people can really connect with that. And on a human level when you have that type of understanding, it puts you in a place where you can learn and get better.\n\nTo Asa, I happen to be there to some extent. Asa started out working for his uncle\u2019s record company, Storm records, and of course you know Storm records at the time in Nigeria were like the biggest record label Nigeria. So that gave him a platform, that gave him access to do a lot of things and meet a lot of people. So I remember there was a time when Asa was hosting club nights in a lot of big clubs or Storm was handling PR for a lot of big clubs and it was him who would directly manage that relationship. So overtime, this guy had a strong contact base and I saw him first hand deploy all of this to push his music forward.\n\nAnd David is very clinical in his actions. He knows what he wants to do and he goes for it. We talked about \u201cBack When\u201d, do you know that he paid Naeto C for that feature? One would think that because Asa is his little cousin things would come easily, no, that feature was paid for and it was business, at that point how many people were paid? I think he paid about a million naira for him to do the audio and then be on the video. The video was shot by Clarence Peters, and over time we have seen how many more Clarence Peters videos he has made. Meaning that he wants the quality of the work to be good every step of his way .\n\nI can\u2019t say how the disagreement happened, but these things happen, at some point they fell in and then Kamal came in and a lot of things. But it takes a lot of honesty and sincerity for you to look at something and say, I should go back to this guy, this really loves me and was out for my best interest and he did just that.\n\nAnd from a manager\u2019s point of view, that was for me a key moment in the industry because I don\u2019t remember seeing stuff like that happen a lot of times. When an artiste falls out with his manager, and they go back to do their thing and honestly say \u2018you\u2019re the person who can do this thing, I\u2019m sorry about everything, let us just keep going\u2019. I strongly believe that as we celebrate David we ought to celebrate Asa as well.\n\nA lot of people think 2016 was Davido\u2019s biggest moment. I saw a video on twitter and it was a thread of different renowned celebrities singing those 2016 fire songs, FIA, IF and Fall. There was even a Kanye West sample. How did David crack the international scene with those songs?\n\nLike I said, David is very passionate, very driven, when he feels like it\u2019s time to get things done, he goes out to get it. Yes, he was already shutting things down on the Africa front, but that \u2018IF\u2019 victory was a calculated promo plan on their path.\n\nI\u2019m sure he must have sent them back some decent dollars to some announcers in American and possibly gotten some help with the international labels he was in at that time. This was someone basically saying I think it\u2019s about time we get this thing done and he went all out and then made it happen. It took some time but eventually the figures and everything started to add up. That was another coordinated plan by David and his team.\n\nDavido has amassed over a billion streams so far and I think that\u2019s very rich, how critical is digital streaming to the growth of Afrobeats?\n\nVery critical, and it is not like we have a choice because digital streaming is where the parties are right now. There\u2019s nobody who is trying to engage with your physical products anymore and there\u2019s nobody trying to buy your VHS or anything.\n\nSo it\u2019s not like we have a choice but it\u2019s a good thing people think that we were deemed enough to engage in those platforms and we woke up to the right technology and partnership of technology early enough. Imagine that we made all these things happen without our own numbers being registered on platforms like Spotify. Spotify just only came to Nigeria this year. So it just shows that despite all the numbers you have been seeing on Spotify, Nigerians in Nigeria our numbers are not even there.\n\nIt just shows how much better these things are going to be, and we have Audiomack, we have YouTube, we have Apple music, we have Spotify these brands have also realised that we Nigerians are an important market. And shout out to Nigerians in diaspora, they continue to push the culture forward. I like to think that they are the unsung heroes of Afrobeats music, because Nigerians everywhere and we can make music everywhere. Maybe that\u2019s the advantage we have over other countries because of the chances that you\u2019re going to find Nigerians everywhere. We are always travelling so It\u2019s easy for our music to travel as well. Hopefully, the internet data can get cheaper and more people can be able to access smart phones and all these gadgets and then stream it down and more people can be able to jam in and help grow this ecosystem.\n\nBurnaboy and Wizkid, recently bagged the grammy awards, will Davido get one soon?\n\nI think David is very close to it, because away from the music, the Grammy sometimes can tend to be like a popularity contest sometimes and, David is quite high up there and more than anything this dude has shown us that he has the ability to continue to bag out this heat. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any stopping that soon. This guy is not even 30 years old yet so David definitely has a lot of time on his clock to go out there and make it happen. He has the pedigree, he has the connections, he has the finance, he has everything, and ultimately he has music.\n\nI like to think eventually, David is going to be on his stage, hold his neck and say \u2018E choke\u2019 at some point.\n\nIn a recent interview with Ebuka, Davido said stuff like, Grammy no be by force. Do you think he can be as intentional as Burna Boy was or probably deviate from his light hearted niche?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think David has found his sweet spot. It\u2019s almost like we have forgotten but the huge positive uprising that happened last year, which is the EndSARS movement, David\u2019s song ended up being the song track for that whole movement.\n\nSo this man makes impactful music, he has the pedigree to back it up, He has the fanbase, he has the people, he has everything. So David has found his sweet spot. I don\u2019t think everyone has to sound the same.\n\nFor Burnaboy from the job, for those of us who were following him, everyone saw the view that at some point this guy called Burna Boy is going to win a Grammy. I\u2019m one of those people who wasn\u2019t surprised. I was literally just counting down to the day, he\u2019s that gifted, and his international appeal and his close relationship with Atlantic. Atlantic realised they had a gem in their hand and they really went out to position him like one.\n\nHow do you make an album like that and you do not have a Grammy? It\u2019s impossible. Diddy is your executive producer, Anderson Park is playing drums in there and Youssou N\u2019Dour is in there, you know, and all this other thing, and then you have the world\u2019s famous Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin\u2019s on that record. So every step of the way, you know this was a Grammy product, this was positioned for that and it eventually got it. Besides, a year before he had gotten a nomination, the one that he lost to another African legend Angelique Kidjo, so everybody just knew that it\u2019s only a matter of time, this guy is gonna get this nomination again and he\u2019s going to win. So, I have no doubt in my mind that as long as David continues to do his thing, he is going to win it at some point.\n\nWould there be any career regret if Davido never wins a Grammy?\n\nNo, there will be none. He is an accomplished artiste as it is. It was this year that Nas got his Grammy for the first time and there are plenty of other people that never got the Grammy but we know that these people are some of the finest artistes. Do you know Snoop Dogg never won a Grammy?\n\nSo there are plenty of other people like that, so sometimes these things happen. Maybe you dropped a project in a year, well then just so happened to be like a bigger or more popular project and then, you know there are those variables and these things that happen. So in my opinion David is really an accomplished musician, he has traveled round the world, he has met everybody, he has made money, he has made a clout, I mean what else is there to do? At this point he just needs to keep making music because that is what he has feelings for.\n\nWhat can young hungry artistes out there learn from Davido?\n\nBe open to collaboration. Know that using a songwriter does not mean you\u2019re a terrible musician, sometimes you write alone, sometimes you need to sing somebody\u2019s perspective to give your music that bit of freshness.\n\nSecond, you need to show that you want it, you need to be hungry about this thing, like I said before, David is not the first rich kid we have seen, but we have seen plenty of them who didn\u2019t seem to have that fight in them.\n\nThird, you have to be passionate, this is what you love, submit to it. One vibe you get from David is that this brother has genuine love for music. Just follow your heart, be passionate, be hardworking and if you have money to put in, put it in, be an entrepreneur.\n\nI want to add something else, just in case we don\u2019t get to touch that. Let us not forget that in the history of artistes who run record labels, we possibly have not had anyone that has been successful as DMW. So away from being an artiste, even as an executive or a label guy, David has been hugely successful, Mayorkun is big, Perruzi is big, Dremo, all these other people, so unlike all other guys who have tried to start a label, even the people he\u2019s competing with, a lot of them do not have anything going on that level, but away from David being this guy, he has also successfully built a platform that is huge as well, so David the executive also deserves a lot of kudos.\n\nHas Afrobeats peaked with this Grammy win and its present level of influence?\n\nI do not think so. If anything, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re just getting started. I was recently saying to someone, these days it appears like the producers outside Nigeria are even starting to make better Afrobeats production or songs than us. People like Jay Five, people like P2J, there\u2019s this guy in Los Angeles who does work for Tiwa savage and Seyi Shay plenty of these people, these guys are making incredible stuff. You know how a black American cannot really really say hip hop is our thing anymore because in Asia they now make hip hop, Africans make hip hop, a lot of people make hip hop, so that\u2019s the beauty of your tradition on your product going across. It sort of gets to a place where it feels like it\u2019s no longer yours anymore because a lot of people have now bought into your product and they love it so I see that happening with Afrobeats.\n\nAnother thing is that these guys are still young and they\u2019re going to continue making music. Wizkid is a big superstar, look at what he did with Made in Lagos, so projects like that help to reinforce the importance of this genre, people like Burna Boy, Burna Boy is only just getting started, Davido is a young man, he\u2019s just getting started, let\u2019s not even talk about the younger people who are coming behind them, Buju, Joeboy, Fireboy DML, Tems, all these people, so I think we\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nHow can the government key into the million dollars Afrobeats industry now and provide active and actual beneficial support to the growth of the industry now?\n\nMaybe that ship might have sailed because before we got into this digital age, we used to beg the government to come and help us stop piracy, come and help us stop this people who are creating our CDs and selling, come and help us stop these people in Alaba who are faking our products, but now with digital, nobody even cares about them anymore, so you find out that more and more we don\u2019t even need to talk to these people, we don\u2019t need them for anything. The labels have stepped up, were getting investments, international labels are coming in to partner with our local guys here, we have big artiste development and artiste relation companies like Platoon, like ONErpm, like Empire, like Orchard and all this people coming to Nigeria to set up shop, so it appears that through our own sheer determination and hard work, we have taken this thing to a level where it has really taken off, all the government can do is to congratulate people where the would help us.\n\nSo there\u2019s no role left for the government now?\n\nPerhaps that ship has sailed, so maybe they should perhaps help us add more event centres, you know just put in laws and regulations that help people to do business more easily. But generally, the success has gone beyond them.\n\nFans of Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy are always pitching against themselves on social media. Is this beneficial to the artistes or can it be very damaging to their career and industry growth in the long term?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Because these people are the people who speak up and drum up support for these people that helps to take them to the next level. So now the onus is on the artistes and their handlers to understand that hey, you people must remain friends ooh. You must know that these people would always come with these competitive problems but you guys must know that hey, fans are just doing what fans do.\n\nHowever the competitiveness is what makes it fun. A lot of times, if there\u2019s no competition people are not really bothered to go the extra mile, so there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\nDavido coming to tweet and say \u2018Yo, my fans stop doing this doesn\u2019t change anything\u2019, yeah, you get on Twitter you would discover that there are a lot of handles that are dedicated solely to these guys and all they do is talk about them, tweet them and drop fights and everything. So at that point it is out of your hand, it is just up to you to understand that now it\u2019s part of the game, but these people are my brothers and we should not let what the fans say make us enemies but however, the noise that the fans are making out is important.\n\nObinna Agwu is a music executive and talent manager who has had in his clientele MI Abaga amid a plethora of other artistes.\n\nListen to his expert analysis of happenings in the entertainment industry on Listening Session Podcast",

          "title": "The Economist: Nigeria\u2019s economy is stuck in a rut",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 4\n\nRising oil prices will bring short-term relief, butmay delay essential reforms.\n\nTALK THAT everything is expensive fills the air at a market in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital. Since February the minibus fare from home to the market has doubled, says Emmanuel Mokwe, who sells kitchen utensils. So has the price of food, he adds grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos,\u201d says Dotun Babande, who runs a juice shop across town.\n\nInflation is running at 18%. For food it is 23%, the highest in two decades. More than half of Nigerians are underemployed or unemployed. Before covid-19 about 80m of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic andpopulation growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023,says the World Bank.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic woes also help explain a vertiginous rise in crime. More people were kidnapped in the first four months of this year thanall of last year, according to Jose Luengo-Cabrera of the World Bank.This has added to worsening violence around three flashpoints: thejihadists of Boko Haram in the north-east; a long-standing conflict between farmers and cattle- herders across central Nigeria; and fighting between government forces and Igbo separatists in the south-east.\n\nCovid-19 has slammed economies everywhere, but Nigeria\u2019s economicmalaise predates the pandemic. GDP per person has fallen every yearsince 2015, when oil prices slumped (see chart). The World Bank reckons that by the end of the year real income per person in Nigeria, home to one in six of sub- Saharan Africa\u2019s people, will be at the same level as it was in the 1980s. Reform is desperately needed, but fiendishly difficult to enact.\n\nAlthough oil makes up about 9% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, it accounts for 80% of export earnings and about half of government revenues. A long slump in its price\u2014from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to less than half thatfor most of last year\u2014has squeezed the supply of foreign exchange.\n\nNormally economies would adjust by letting their exchange rates fall, making imports more expensive. This can be painful in the short term since it fuels inflation. But usually it helps boost exports by making them more competitive. If Nigeria could make, grow or mine more forexport, it would be less vulnerable to swings in the oil price.\n\nInstead, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has restricted imports in an effort to prop up the currency, which he sees asa measure of Nigeria\u2019s strength. In an attempt to conserve dollars, thecentral bank has banned those intending to import almost 50 items from buying foreign currency. Last month wheat and sugar were added to the list. In 2019 Mr Buhari closed Nigeria\u2019s land borders to goods to stop smugglers undermining local producers. Both moves have fuelled food-price inflation.\n\nThey have also hobbled manufacturing firms by making it hard for themto obtain inputs. Manufacturers would be lucky if they get 20% of the forex they request, says Muda Yusuf of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ajibade Oluwabukunmi imports medical equipment and uses the volatile black market, where dollars cost almost 30% more than the official rate. \u201cNigeria is in a shambles,\u201d he laments. Despite all its unorthodox controls, the central bank was forced to devalue the naira twice last year. Businesses are getting neither a stable currency nor access to dollars.\n\nThe government may slowly be changing its tune. Bismarck Rewane, an economist who is also on the president\u2019s council of economic advisers, says that \u201cthe futility of a Robinson Crusoe economy became very clear for everybody\u201d. The government is starting to pay more attention to exporters, he claims, pointing to the partial reopening of land bordersfor goods in December and Nigeria\u2019s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2019.\n\nYet sustained growth in exports requires more than just opening the border. Many firms are uncompetitive because they are hampered by red tape and government failures. \u201cGovernment is the biggest problem for business in Nigeria,\u201d says Bashir Abdulrahman of Credent Capital and Advisory, an investment bank.\n\nElectricity blackouts are maddeningly frequent. Roads are often poor and ports clogged up. Moving a container 20km from the port of Lagosto the city can cost $4,000, almost as much as shipping it 12,000km from China. Nigeria ranks 131st out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s ease-of- doing-business index. Although some industries, such as information technology, are growing, this is \u201cin spite of the government\u201d, says Tayo Oviosu of Paga, a mobile-payments company.\n\nThe government has tried to give the poor more aid to get them through the pandemic. It also promises to improve infrastructure. But spending on salaries and other annual costs chews up 75% of the federal budget, leaving little money to invest in roads or railways. With a view to freeing funds for infrastructure, the government last year promised to cut costly fuel subsidies. Yet that has been halted in the face of opposition.\n\nThe stalled reform is typical of Nigeria\u2019s troubles. For decades cash from oil has been used to subsidise things like fuel and electricity. The easy revenue also allowed the federal and state governments to getaway with abysmal tax collection. Worse, it fostered corruption.\n\nMany Nigerians have had enough. Between 2014 and 2018 the percentage who want to emigrate rose from 36% to 52%, one of thehighest levels in Africa. Rising oil prices this year will ease the shortages and boost government finances. Yet that may reduce the pressure to fix deeper economic problems, admits Kayode Fayemi, a state governor. Nonetheless, he believes there is an \u201calmost overwhelming consensus\u201d on the need to restructure the economy. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it,\u201d he warns, \u201cwe run the risk of disintegration.\u201d ?\n\nThis article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \u201cStuck in a rut\u201d for the Economist Magazine.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Alkasim Abdulkadir provides rare insight into the fight against insurgency, nation building and why Nigerian youths must chase money",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",
          "summary": "Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility.\nResearching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest.\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this dayBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore.\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city.\nIt does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

          "text": "Former President Goodluck Jonathan has warned the international community against taking sides in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine.\n\nIn total, 197 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including at least 58 children, and more than 1,200 wounded since Israel launched its air campaign against Hamas, a terrorist organisation on May 10 after the group fired rockets. The heaviest exchange of fire in years was sparked by unrest in Jerusalem.\n\nBut taking to Twitter on Monday, the ex-President said the conflict can only be resolved when those living within the borders of Israel and Palestine take the time to understand each other until they come to a place where they can coexist, co-prosper, and eventually cooperate.\n\nHe also called for peace on both sides, adding that the international community should work towards ensuring a ceasefire.\n\n\u201cI sue for peace in both Israel and Palestine, and urge that every international support should be towards deescalating the conflict, rather than escalating it,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Becoming A Governor Made Me Even Poorer,\u2019 Okorocha Denies Corruption Allegation\n\n\u201cThe present conflict in that part of the world can never be resolved by nations and institutions taking sides. It can only be resolved by those living within the borders of Israel and Palestine taking time to understand each other until they come to a place where they can coexist, co-prosper and eventually cooperate.\n\n\u201cFor that to happen, what is needed, in the immediate term, is a ceasefire, followed by massive confidence building on both sides. That is what the international community should aim for. Peace. It is achievable.\u201d\n\nI have been to both Israel and Palestine, and as a result, I have some understanding and appreciation of the human angles on both divides. Borders are often human constructs, but the Divine instruction we have is to love our neighbour as ourselves. \u2014 Goodluck E. Jonathan (@GEJonathan) May 17, 2021\n\nOvernight Sunday to Monday, Israel launched dozens of strikes in the space of a few minutes across the crowded coastal Palestinian enclave controlled by Islamist group Hamas, according to AFP journalists and the army.\n\nFlames lit up the sky as explosions shook Gaza city.\n\nThe strikes caused widespread power cuts and damaged hundreds of buildings, local authorities said. No casualties were immediately reported.\n\nWest Gaza resident Mad Abed Rabbo, 39, expressed \u201chorror and fear\u201d at the intensity of the onslaught.\n\n\u201cThere have never been strikes of this magnitude,\u201d he said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s army said in a statement that it hit the homes of nine \u201chigh-ranking\u201d Hamas commanders, without providing details on casualties.\n\nThe overnight bombardment also included the third round of strikes on what the army calls the \u201cMetro,\u201d its term for a Hamas underground tunnel network.\n\nFifty-four fighter jets pounded 15 kilometers (nine miles) of tunnels, which the army has previously acknowledged runs in part through civilian areas.\n\nGazan Mani Qazaat said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cshould realise we\u2019re civilians, not fighters\u201d, adding \u201cI felt like I was dying\u201d.\n\n\u2018Legitimate\u2019\n\nThe renewed strikes come a day after 42 Palestinians in Gaza \u2014 including at least eight children and two doctors, according to the health ministry \u2014 were killed in the worst daily death toll in the enclave since the bombardments began.\n\nIn Israel, 10 people, including one child, have been killed and 294 wounded by rocket fire launched by armed groups in Gaza.\n\nIsrael\u2019s army said about 3,100 rockets had been fired since last Monday from Gaza \u2014 the highest rate ever recorded \u2014 but added its Iron Dome anti-missile system had intercepted over 1,000.\n\nNetanyahu said in a televised address Sunday that Israel\u2019s \u201ccampaign against the terrorist organisations is continuing with full force\u201d and would \u201ctake time\u201d to finish.\n\nThe Israeli army said it had targeted the infrastructure of Hamas and armed group Islamic Jihad, weapons factories and storage sites.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes also hit the home of Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas\u2019s political wing in Gaza, the army said, releasing footage of plumes of smoke and intense damage, but without saying if he was killed.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel gave journalists from Al Jazeera and AP news agency an hour to evacuate their offices before launching airstrikes, turning their tower block into piles of smoking rubble.\n\nNetanyahu on Sunday said the building also hosted a Palestinian \u201cterrorist\u201d intelligence office.\n\n\u201cIt is a perfectly legitimate target,\u201d he said.\n\nInter-communal clashes\n\nThe violence between Hamas and Israel is the worst since 2014 when Israel launched a military operation on the Gaza Strip with the stated aim of ending rocket fire and destroying tunnels used for smuggling.\n\nThe war left 2,251 dead on the Palestinian side, mostly civilians, and 74 on the Israeli side, mostly soldiers.\n\nOpening the first session of the UN Security Council on the renewed violence on Sunday, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the fighting \u201cutterly appalling\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt must stop immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the UN talks, already delayed by Israel\u2019s ally the United States, resulted in little action, with Washington opposing a resolution.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration says it is working behind the scenes, and that a Security Council statement could backfire.\n\nIsrael is also trying to contain inter-communal violence between Jews and Arab-Israelis, as well as deadly clashes in the occupied West Bank, where 19 Palestinians have been killed since May 10, according to a toll from Palestinian authorities.\n\nMajor clashes broke out at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2014 one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites \u2014 on May 7 following a crackdown against protests over planned expulsions of Palestinians in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.\n\nSheikh Jarrah has been at the heart of the flareup, seeing weeks of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces.\n\nOn Sunday, a car-ramming attack in Sheikh Jarrah wounded seven police officers, police said, adding that the attacker had been killed.\n\nPolice also said \u201ca number of suspects\u201d had been arrested during clashes in another east Jerusalem neighbourhood overnight Sunday to Monday.\n\nGuterres warned the fighting could have far-reaching consequences if not stopped immediately.\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel but in the region as a whole.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria: Apapa Traffic Gridlock May Hurt AfCFTA\u2019s Gains, Operators Warn",
          "text": "Some members of the organised private sector (OPS) have decried the lack of political will to address the perennial traffic congestion around the Apapa ports, saying the gridlock could hurt the expected gains from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement.\n\nSpeaking in separate interviews with THISDAY, they stressed that the challenges associated with moving cargoes in and outside the ports could defeat the federal government\u2019s desire to diversify the economy and affect the expected benefits from Nigeria\u2019s participation in the AfCFTA agreement.\n\nTraffic has worsened in Apapa and its environs in the past few weeks following the disruption of the electronic call-up system (ETO) introduced about two months ago by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) with the support of the Lagos State Government to ensure free flow of vehicular movements.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation had revealed that security agents, who were said to have frustrated all efforts to restore sanity to the port city, were cashing in on the situation to extort articulated vehicles\u2019 drivers.\n\nEven the efforts of a presidential task team failed.\n\nBut the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf, told THISDAY yesterday that, \u201cif the Apapa traffic gridlock continues, our international trade process stands the risk of being completely paralysed.\n\n\u201cThe Apapa corridor accounts for an estimated 70 per cent of international merchandise trade- imports and exports. Therefore, this portends disturbing signals for the outlook for Nigeria\u2019s participation in the AFCFTA. It is impossible to undertake any meaningful trade without an efficient maritime logistics chain.\u201d\n\nThe LCCI added that the burdensome processes and traffic jam at the Apapa ports have continued to stifle productivity of the real sector of the economy and have, \u201cworsened the plight of many importers, exporters, traders, and manufacturer, as movement in and out of the ports remain a challenge and escalating haulage fees.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, the Director General of the Nigeria-America Chamber of Commerce (NACC), Mr. Sola Obadimu, told THISDAY that the economic effects of the traffic gridlock in Apapa axis is multi-dimensional and wondered why \u201cthere is no political will to confront it.\u201d\n\nObadimu stated that Nigeria\u2019s participation in the AfCFTA would not make sense if the country could not ensure effective port processes and services for export of its manufactured goods at efficient cost.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria can never be competitive under the AfCFTA by having its functioning ports in Lagos alone. The question is why struggle with the ports in Lagos when we have a coast line that stretches from Badagry to Calabar and could have developed at least five standard ports that can take any vessel if they are well dredged.\n\n\u201cThe basic principle is that we need to earn foreign exchange by exporting more. But with the situation as it is, the country will be losing opportunity to earn foreign exchange and by so doing the Naira will be losing value; inflation will be going up and the economy will be crumbling. Moreover, the intention to diversify the economy will remain a lip service.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of the Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, also told THISDAY that the telling consequences of the Apapa traffic gridlock on businesses could only be imagined, especially for those involved in the importation of sensitive raw materials for manufacture of finished products.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe note that when these goods and raw materials are finally retrieved, they may have been destroyed due to temperature excursions and assuming that they are not destroyed, the long exposure to the elements raised serious quality challenges on those imported raw materials and finished products.\u201d\n\nHe urged government to give the problem the serious attention it deserved, adding that the initial euphoria that greeted the introduction of the e-call-up system to solve the logjam quickly fizzled out and the gridlock appeared to be worsening by the day.\n\nThe NECA urged government \u201cto consider train services within Apapa axis and from Apapa to other parts of the country because of its positive economic implications.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, the Director General of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Mr. Laoye Jaiyesola, stated that as long as the Apapa traffic jam remained, Nigerian made goods would never be competitive in both the domestic and foreign markets.\n\nJaiyesola said: \u201cFor us we have been pleading that it should be resolved. It is very sad that it has remained the way it is and in fact has gotten worse. We never had it so bad.\n\n\u201cBut the solution is to develop other ports. Apart from Lagos there is Onne Port, there is Warri Port. Why will these ports not become operational so that Lagos would be decongested? Secondly, what is holding back linking these ports with rail services?\u201d\n\nFor the Director General of Institute of Directors (IoD) Nigeria, Mr. Dele Alani, the gridlock at Apapa seemed to be a problem that has defied all solutions that were proffered by previous and current administrations.\n\nAlani said: \u201cWhat is not in doubt is that the gridlock in Apapa has adversely affected businesses. Incidentally, for an import dependent economy like Nigeria, the effect of the Apapa gridlock is felt by virtually all sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\nHe called for the identification of the root causes of the problem to avoid proffering and applying cosmetic solutions and suggested the resuscitation of ports located outside Lagos State as the most effective solution.\n\nSimilarly, The Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, noted that \u201cthe impact of current situation on the economy is crippling. And as the voice of business in Nigeria, we call on governments to find an enduring solution to this problem because of its negative impact on the economy,\u201d adding that \u201cit is sad that government allowed the traffic gridlock in Apapa area to last this long.\u201d\n\nOlukanni proposed regular roundtable by heads of freight forwarders, maritime transport union, customs and Federal Road Safety Commission to discuss issues as they arise and ensure that truck drivers obey the laws.\n\nHe also requested that the rail system, which is now coming up, should be expedited to help in moving cargo in and out of ports and that trucks without the Terminal Delivery Order should not be allowed into the port while \u201cother sea ports in the country should be utilised,\u201d he said.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",
