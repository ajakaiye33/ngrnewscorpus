          "text": "For the first time in months, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), stepped out together with his wife, Mrs Aisha Buhari, on Thursday, to celebrate this year\u2019s Eid-el Fitr and completion of one-month Ramadan fast.\n\nIn a series of photos shared via Buhari\u2019s social media handles, the President and the First Lady were seen flanked by their children and their spouses. In separate photos, the President was also seen with lads young enough to be his grandchildren.\n\nBuhari, in a string of tweets, congratulated all Muslims on the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid festival and prayed that it will bring with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst others.\n\nThe retired major general also stressed on \u201cunity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians\u201d, adding that these virtues are imperative \u201cespecially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one\u201d.\n\nSignificantly, The PUNCH observed that today marked the first time the President and the First Lady were seen together in public or together in photos.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that Mrs Buhari left the Presidential Villa, Abuja, for Dubai in September 2020 and stayed there for about six months before she quietly returned to the country in March 2021.\n\nThe First Lady\u2019s aides claimed she had gone to Dubai for medical treatment but Mrs Buhari, whom many have described as a fearless and outspoken critic of her husband\u2019s government, especially on the matter of security, has been at loggerheads with the President\u2019s aides and close relatives in recent time.\n\nIn 2019, she accused the President\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura, of hijacking the Presidency, adding that the President\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, had even issued statements on behalf of the President without his knowledge but based on instructions from Daura.\n\nIn 2020, passions reached a climax when security aides to a relative and Personal Assistant to the President, Tunde Sabiu, fired shots inside the Presidential Villa during an altercation with Aisha\u2019s aides.\n\nThe PUNCH had also reported that the President sent out birthday wishes to at least over six notable Nigerians in February 2021 but did not wish his wife, who attained the milestone age of 50, a happy birthday on February 17, 2021.\n\nThe President was also not present at the public presentation of the biography of Mrs Aisha at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on April 8, 2021.\n\nThe First Lady had launched a book, titled, \u2018Aisha Buhari: Being Different\u2019, which was written by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Administration and Women Affairs, Dr Hajo Sani.\n\nThe President, who was in London for medical check-up at the time, did not speak virtually during the launch and his aides didn\u2019t issue any statement recognising the feat by Mrs Buhari, leaving many to wonder if the relationship between the first couple have gone frosty.",

The carnival has now been adopted as a yearly event by the people of Ondo town.\n\nThe meeting ended on a successful note with the governor not only signing on Akinboboye as a strategic partner and arrowhead of Ondo State tourism project, but he also unfolded his dream for tourism and what he intends to achieve with it for the state.\n\nREAD ALSO NUPENG directs members to shut down services in Kaduna State\n\n\u2018\u2018To realise our dream for the development of Ondo\u2019s tourism and entertainment industry, we have entered into a strategic alliance with a much-lauded private sector practitioner, Otunba (Dr.) Wanle Akinboboye, the founder of La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort, who is also a son of the soil from Ondo town,\u2019\u2019 disclosed Governor Akeredolu.\n\n\u2018\u2018Otunba Akinboboye has been in the tourism industry for over three decades and has shown his mettle via the creation of his flagship resort in Ikegun Village Lagos State. He was also involved in the initial creation of the Mare Festival and recently the Asun Carnival launched by Destination Ondo, an initiative created by him this month for his town and by extension, our state.\n\n\u2018\u2018We believe that with this alliance, our expectation for tourism, and entertainment development, will be realised and our Sunshine State will once again set the pace on finding unique and creative solutions to our challenges as a people.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe is very clear where he is headed with his tourism dream as he said to Akinboboye that: \u2018\u2018We believe that the employment generated by the type of tourism industry we envisaged for our state will provide opportunities for all.\n\nThis is because it does not focus solely on educational achievements. Rather it embraces an understanding of our culture, the ability to showcase our music and dance and a willingness to display our pride in the talents and heritage of our great people.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo underscore the fact that he is on top of his game and knows where attention should be focused, he then outlined a number of the tourist attractions of the state that he wants to put on the global tourism map for the benefit of his beloved people.\n\n\u2018\u2018As you are aware, our glorious state is filled with many natural attractions. These attractions include an expanse of coastline of sandy beaches, countless mountains, rivers and the famous Idanre Hills, where mountains came to host a conference and then refused to leave.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ondo State also has a rich cultural heritage that embraces unique music and dance. Our state must harness her natural features, culture and talents to create and operate a tourism and entertainment industry that focuses on showcasing the best of Ondo State\u2019s culture and natural features while creating wealth and hope for our youths.\u2019\u2019\n\nBesides, he stated that as part of the commitment to the tourism project, he has created an atmosphere for peace and security to thrive in the state through empowering a security outfit for the state, known as Amotekun.\n\n\u2018\u2018In Nigeria today, two key issues that require intense focus by the government are security and youth engagement, employment and empowerment.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was with this in mind that the Ondo State government, under my leadership, established and is operating the Amotekun Security Force, which has introduced and maintains a security network that leverages off the security skills of our people to assist in making Ondo State a more secure state.\n\n\u2018\u2018Simultaneously with this initiative, our government is also focusing on job creation and youth empowerment. In this regard, we are acutely aware that the major part of the security challenges in Nigeria arise from the disenfranchisement felt by millions of our youths, who are unable to find gainful employment to generate the income they require to cater for their basic needs and the dreams to which they are entitled.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs he takes this tentative step with Akinboboye on the driver\u2019s seat, Akeredolu is calling on the people of the state to take a ride with him on the Destination Ondo\u2019s tourism bus.\n\n\u2018\u2018I would also encourage others from Ondo State who have made their marks in their various areas of endeavours to lend their support to the development of our great state and people so that they can be proud not only of where they are now but also of where they originated from.\u2019\u2019\n\nPIX CAPTION( Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State with Otunba (Dr.) Wanle Akinboboye, the founder of La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

His remains have been deposited at the Air Force Hospital in Jos.\n\nDogoyaro was a member of the Langtang Mafia in Nigeria\u2019s military circle.

General; former ECOMOG Commander; retired in 1993; Passed Staff College (PSC); National Institute (mni); Forces Service Star (FSS).\n\nCoup speech: \u201cFellow country men, the intervention of the military at the end of 1983 was welcomed by the nation with unprecedented enthusiasm. Nigerians were unified in accepting the intervention and looked forward hopefully to progressive changes for the better. Almost two years later, it has become clear that the fulfillment of expectations is not forthcoming.\n\n\u201cBecause this generation of Nigerians and indeed future generations have no other country but Nigeria, we could not stay passive and watch a small group of individuals misuse power to the detriment of our national aspirations and interest.\n\n\u201cNo nation can ever achieve meaningful strides in its development where there is an absence of cohesion in the hierarchy of government; where it has become clear that positive action by the policy makers is hindered because as a body it lacks a unity of purpose.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that the nation would be endangered with the risk of continuous misdirection. We are presently confronted with that danger. In such a situation, if action can be taken to arrest further damage, it should and must be taken. This is precisely what we have done.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian public has been made to believe that the slow pace of action of the Federal Government headed by Major-General Muhammadu Buhari was due to the enormity of the problems left by the last civilian administration.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is true that a lot of problems were left behind by the last civilian government, the real reason, however, for the very slow pace of action is due to lack of unanimity of purpose among the ruling body; subsequently, the business of governance has gradually been subjected to ill-motivated power play considerations.\n\n\u201cThe ruling body, the Supreme Military Council, has, therefore, progressively been made redundant by the actions of a select few members charged with the day-to-day implementation of the SMC\u2019s policies and decision.\n\n\u201cThe concept of collective leadership has been substituted by stubborn and ill-advised unilateral actions, thereby destroying the principles upon which the government came to power. Any effort made to advise the leadership, met with stubborn resistance and was viewed as a challenge to authority or disloyalty.\n\n\u201cThus, the scene was being set for systematic elimination of what, was termed oppositions. All the energies of the rulership were directed at this imaginary opposition rather than to effective leadership.\n\n\u201cThe result of this misdirected effort is now very evident in the country as a whole. The government has started to drift. The economy does not seem to be getting any better as we witness daily increased inflation.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s meager resources are once again being wasted on unproductive ventures. Government has distanced itself from the people and the yearnings and aspirations of the people as constantly reflected in the media have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThis is because a few people have arrogated to themselves the right to make the decisions for the larger part of the ruling body. All these events have shown that the present composition of our country\u2019s leadership cannot, therefore, justify its continued occupation of that position.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the initial objectives and programmes of action which were meant to have been implemented since the ascension to power of the Buhari Administration in January 1984 have been betrayed and discarded. The present state of uncertainty and stagnation cannot be permitted to degenerate into suppression and retrogression.\n\n\u201cWe feel duty bound to use the resources and means at our disposal to restore hope in the minds of Nigerians and renew aspirations for a better future. We are no prophets of doom for our beloved country, Nigeria. We, therefore, count on everyone\u2019s cooperation and assistance.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you, fellow countrymen, particularly my colleagues in arms to refrain from any act that will lead to unnecessary violence and bloodshed among us. Rest assured that our action is in the interest of the nation and the armed forces.\n\n\u201cIn order to enable a new order to be introduced, the following bodies are dissolved forthwith pending further announcements: (a) The Supreme Military Council (b) The Federal Executive Council (c) The National Council of States. All seaports and airports are closed, all borders remain closed.\n\n\u201cFinally, a dusk to dawn curfew is hereby imposed in Lagos and all state capitals until further notice.

          "text": "Over 15 suspected cultists have been killed in Akpabuyo/Bakassi Local Government Area of Cross River State in a renewed cult clash which started on Monday.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that residents in the affected areas have deserted their villages and communities while economic and social activities have been disrupted.\n\nIt was learnt that the three popular cult groups in the area, Skyro, Mafia and Black Scorpion, have always engaged in bloody clashes.\n\nAn eyewitness who declined mentioning his name, lamented the action of the youths and called for the intervention of security operatives.\n\n\u201cThis time, the operation was bloody.\n\n\u201cImagine one of the suspected cult group took their members to a local charm doctor to prepare bulletproof charm and when they tested it by shooting one of them, he died on the spot\u201d he said.\n\nThe eyewitness claimed that some houses and other properties worth millions of naira were destroyed by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cThese boys ran amock and destroyed many houses in the two local government areas\u201d\n\nWhen DAILY POST contacted the Deputy Police Public Relations Officer, Igri Ewa, he said the command has not been briefed on the cult activities in the areas.\n\nHowever, the chairman of Bakassi local government council, Hon Iyadim Iyadim, while confirming the operation of the cult groups, regretted the actions of the youths.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of killings in the area. It\u2019s cult related but I have not heard of the destruction of houses.\n\n\u201cThe last boy who died, his colleagues took him for charm preparation, to prepare charm for them so that bullets and other dangerous weapons will not penetrate their body,\u201d he told our correspondent via phone.\n\n\u201cWhen he was put on trial, to ascertain the efficacy of the charm, he was shot and he died. That cult group lost three persons coupled with the ones the rival group killed..\n\n\u201cUp to ten persons have been killed and the operations started last two months and extended to this month (May); that is March, April and May.\n\n\u201cWe have reported the matter to the government and on Tuesday, we had a security meeting with the governor,\u201d he stated.\n\nIyadim explained that his local government, Bakassi has no operational base because the same boys destroyed the local government office during the #EndSARS protests.\n\n\u201cNot even a ruler or pin was left. What was left was for them to put fire in the local government secretariats, so nothing is left.\n\n\u201cAnd as at now, some soldiers who were around have been withdrawn and redeployed to other areas. The boys have ransacked police stations and attacked soldiers.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies are afraid as they used charms and have adopted a measure of going to operation in large numbers to attack the military post and police station.\n\n\u201cThe charm will make the security operatives to either fall asleep or make them not to see them as they approach. We are in trouble.\n\nThe Security Adviser, South South, Henry Okokon said, \u201cWe know your ears are on ground and you know the efforts the security agencies have put in the state as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be everywhere at the same time but come to see it, the scripture says God helps those who help themselves, the community should have their own vigilante, they should also provide security for themselves\n\n\u201cBefore things get out of hands, proactive measures should have been put in place. If you have these children as cultists and they are troubling people in that community, just let the security agencies know.\n\n\u201cMust they wait until they start killing people before they call us, more so, if it does not affect a particular person directly of indirectly they will not call or inform anybody.\n\n\u201cWe have chiefs and traditional rulers in those places; ask me what they have been doing. The government had met with them, asking them to fish out all these dangerous boys or inform us.\n\n\u201cBut they refuse to do that rather they allow them to kill people and destroy property before they start calling. We work 24 hours to ensure that we achieve peace in Calabar.\n\n\u201cThere is no more kidnapping because of the intensive security check and they now go beside the riverine areas where there are creeks, where two minutes you are in the creeks and they go there to do the kidnap.\n\n\u201cThe Chiefs in Akpabuyo and Bakassi know these boys, we have told them that if you know these boys tell us,we shall pick them and take them to correctional centre for them to rest there for a while.\n\n\u201cBe it as it may, we shall storm Akpabuyo and Bakassi and embark on house to house search with a view to fetching out these boys and hoodlums,\u201d he said.",

General; former ECOMOG Commander; retired in 1993; Passed Staff College (PSC); National Institute (mni); Forces Service Star (FSS).\n\nCoup speech: \u201cFellow country men, the intervention of the military at the end of 1983 was welcomed by the nation with unprecedented enthusiasm. Nigerians were unified in accepting the intervention and looked forward hopefully to progressive changes for the better. Almost two years later, it has become clear that the fulfillment of expectations is not forthcoming.\n\n\u201cBecause this generation of Nigerians and indeed future generations have no other country but Nigeria, we could not stay passive and watch a small group of individuals misuse power to the detriment of our national aspirations and interest.\n\n\u201cNo nation can ever achieve meaningful strides in its development where there is an absence of cohesion in the hierarchy of government; where it has become clear that positive action by the policy makers is hindered because as a body it lacks a unity of purpose.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that the nation would be endangered with the risk of continuous misdirection. We are presently confronted with that danger. In such a situation, if action can be taken to arrest further damage, it should and must be taken. This is precisely what we have done.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian public has been made to believe that the slow pace of action of the Federal Government headed by Major-General Muhammadu Buhari was due to the enormity of the problems left by the last civilian administration.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is true that a lot of problems were left behind by the last civilian government, the real reason, however, for the very slow pace of action is due to lack of unanimity of purpose among the ruling body; subsequently, the business of governance has gradually been subjected to ill-motivated power play considerations.\n\n\u201cThe ruling body, the Supreme Military Council, has, therefore, progressively been made redundant by the actions of a select few members charged with the day-to-day implementation of the SMC\u2019s policies and decision.\n\n\u201cThe concept of collective leadership has been substituted by stubborn and ill-advised unilateral actions, thereby destroying the principles upon which the government came to power. Any effort made to advise the leadership, met with stubborn resistance and was viewed as a challenge to authority or disloyalty.\n\n\u201cThus, the scene was being set for systematic elimination of what, was termed oppositions. All the energies of the rulership were directed at this imaginary opposition rather than to effective leadership.\n\n\u201cThe result of this misdirected effort is now very evident in the country as a whole. The government has started to drift. The economy does not seem to be getting any better as we witness daily increased inflation.\n\n\u201cThe nation\u2019s meager resources are once again being wasted on unproductive ventures. Government has distanced itself from the people and the yearnings and aspirations of the people as constantly reflected in the media have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThis is because a few people have arrogated to themselves the right to make the decisions for the larger part of the ruling body. All these events have shown that the present composition of our country\u2019s leadership cannot, therefore, justify its continued occupation of that position.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the initial objectives and programmes of action which were meant to have been implemented since the ascension to power of the Buhari Administration in January 1984 have been betrayed and discarded. The present state of uncertainty and stagnation cannot be permitted to degenerate into suppression and retrogression.\n\n\u201cWe feel duty bound to use the resources and means at our disposal to restore hope in the minds of Nigerians and renew aspirations for a better future. We are no prophets of doom for our beloved country, Nigeria. We, therefore, count on everyone\u2019s cooperation and assistance.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you, fellow countrymen, particularly my colleagues in arms to refrain from any act that will lead to unnecessary violence and bloodshed among us. Rest assured that our action is in the interest of the nation and the armed forces.\n\n\u201cIn order to enable a new order to be introduced, the following bodies are dissolved forthwith pending further announcements: (a) The Supreme Military Council (b) The Federal Executive Council (c) The National Council of States. All seaports and airports are closed, all borders remain closed.\n\n\u201cFinally, a dusk to dawn curfew is hereby imposed in Lagos and all state capitals until further notice. All military commanders will ensure effective maintenance of law and order. Further announcements will be made in due course. God bless Nigeria.\u201d",

Other cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, also fell before regaining some ground in Asia trade.\n\nThe use of bitcoin to buy Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles had highlighted a dichotomy between Musk\u2019s reputation as an environmentalist and the use of his popularity and stature as one of the world\u2019s richest people to back cryptocurrencies.\n\nSome Tesla investors, along with environmentalists, have been increasingly critical about the way bitcoin is \u201cmined\u201d using vast amounts of electricity generated with fossil fuels.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday he backed that concern, especially the use of \u201ccoal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\u201d\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,\u201d he tweeted. Tesla shares fell 1.25% after hours.\n\nTesla revealed in February it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, before accepting it as payment for cars in March, driving a roughly 20% surge in the cryptocurrency.\n\nTesla would retain its bitcoin holdings with the plan to use the cryptocurrency as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy sources, Musk said.\n\nBitcoin is created when high-powered computers compete against other machines to solve complex mathematical puzzles, an energy-intensive process that currently often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal.\n\nAt current rates, such bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d devours about the same amount of energy annually as the Netherlands did in 2019, the latest available data from the University of Cambridge and the International Energy Agency shows.\n\nAnalysts said Musk\u2019s about-face was inevitable.\n\n\u201cThe environmental impact from mining bitcoins was one of the biggest risks for the entire crypto market,\u201d said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at currency trading firm OANDA.\n\nMeltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at digital asset manager CoinShares Group, said Tesla was unlikely to have sold many, if any, cars using bitcoin and the backflip generated positive publicity while simplifying payment processes.\n\n\u201cElon was getting a lot of questions and criticisms and this statement allows him to appease critics while still keeping bitcoin on his balance sheet,\u201d Demirors said.\n\nMark Humphery-Jenner, an associate professor of finance at the University of New South Wales, said he was more concerned about Tesla management\u2019s \u201cvery hasty and precipitous\u201d decision-making.\n\nMusk did not say in his Twitter comments whether any vehicles had been purchased with bitcoin and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCRYPTOCURRENCY SUPPORT\n\nSome bitcoin proponents note that the existing financial system \u2013 with its millions of employees and computers in air-conditioned offices \u2013 uses large amounts of energy too.\n\nMusk reiterated he remained a strong believer in cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use <1% of bitcoin\u2019s energy/transaction,\u201d he tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nJust a day earlier, Musk had polled Twitter users on whether Tesla should accept dogecoin, a currency he has helped turn from a joke into a valuable commodity.\n\nHe announced on Sunday that his commercial rocket company SpaceX will accept dogecoin as payment to launch a lunar mission next year \u2013 just hours after he sent the cryptocurrency spiraling downward when he called it a \u201ca hustle\u201d during a guest-host spot on the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedy sketch TV show.\n\nCHINA DOMINANCE\n\nThe dominance of Chinese bitcoin miners and lack of motivation to swap cheap fossil fuels for more expensive renewables could mean there are few quick fixes to the cryptocurrency\u2019s emissions problem.\n\nChinese miners account for about 70% of bitcoin production, data from the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance shows. They tend to use renewable energy \u2013 mostly hydropower \u2013 during the rainy summer months, but fossil fuels \u2013 primarily coal \u2013 for the rest of the year.\n\nOfficials in Beijing are conducting a check on data centres involved in cryptocurrency mining to better understand their impact on energy consumption, sources told Reuters last month.\n\nIn theory, blockchain analysis firms say, it is possible to track the source of bitcoin, raising the possibility that a premium could be charged for green bitcoin.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Mixed Martial Artist, Conor McGregor, has been named as the world\u2019s highest-paid athlete, beating Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to the top spot, according to the annual Forbes list.\n\nThe ten highest-paid athletes in the world, which included NBA star, Lebron James and Tennis legend, Roger Federer, were said to have taken home pretax gross earnings of $1.05 billion during the past 12 months, 28 per cent more than last year\u2019s top earners.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the combined haul falls just a few million short of the $1.06 billion record set in 2018, the 12-month window in which boxer Floyd Mayweather earned $285 million, almost all of it from his 2017 pay-per-view fight with Conor McGregor.\n\nThe Irish fighter, according to the magazine, collected a total of $180 million over the last 12 months; most of that comes from his recent sale of his majority stake in whiskey brand Proper No. Twelve to Proximo Spirits for $150 million.\n\nAdding in his endorsements, McGregor made $158m outside of his fighting career over the last 12 months, becoming only the third athlete, after Roger Federer and Tiger Woods, to earn more than $70 million off the field in a single year while still actively competing.\n\n\n\nAlthough McGregor lost his rematch against Dustin Poirier in January this year in Abu Dhabi, the 32-year-old made just $22m (\u00a315m) from the fight in the Octagon.\n\nForbes reported that it would be his first time at No. 1 and his second appearance in the top ten (he landed at No. 4 with $99 million in 2018 after the fight against Mayweather) and McGregor is looking towards more business plans having recently expressed interest in buying Manchester United, the Premier League\u2019s most valuable team, in recent tweets.\n\nThe trio of Barcelona and Argentina\u2019s Messi, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo and NFL quarterback Dak Prescott also surpassed $100 million in total earnings this year to rank 2nd, 3rd and 4th respectively on the top 10 highest-paid athletes.\n\n\n\nSee Forbes top 10 highest-paid athletes below:\n\nConor McGregor \u2013 $158 m (MMA)\n\nLionel Messi \u2013 $130m (\u00a392m) (Football/Barcelona)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo \u2013 $120m (\u00a385m) (Football/Juventus)\n\nDak Prescott \u2013 $107.5m (NFL/Dallas Cowboys)\n\nLebron James \u2013 $96.5m (NBA/LA Lakers)\n\nNeymar \u2013 $95m (Football/PSG)\n\nRoger Federer -$90m (Tennis)\n\nLewis Hamilton \u2013 $82m (Formula 1/Mercedes)\n\nTom Brady \u2013 $76m (NFL/Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n\nKevin Durant \u2013 $75m (NBA/Brooklyn Nets)",

This nation is in great danger, unless we bring a new spirit and approach.\n\n\u201cSo, we challenge the government to look into security matters and restrain those using weapons of various sorts to intimidate people and creating unrest in the system. We expect a stoppage of the carnage taking place in the farmlands in various locations, and we, also, challenge the people at large to recognise that every human life is sacred. As fellow citizens, we need to cherish one another and bring a spirit of respect and mutual appreciation, so as to minimise and eliminate the bad blood that is circulating in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha Province, Most Rev. Valerian Okeke, decried the lopsidedness in the application of justice in Nigeria and called on government to be fair minded in dealing with the people.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government has found it necessary to disarm those struggling for self defence, while leaving armed herdsmen, bandits who are killing many and destroying people\u2019s farmlands. Instead of addressing the cries of the people, they are crushing those who are crying. The government should be fair in dealing with the people. We rely on God who never fails and we call on all men and women of goodwill to continue to pray, since nothing is impossible before God. Do not be afraid, for God will deliver us.\u201d",

We hold that such is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements which has heightened security challenges with escalated killings and bloody attacks on innocent citizens, while crippling social life, economic activities and food production in the region.\n\n\u201cWe therefore support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\n\u201cWe also support our governor\u2019s restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring that will lead to the devolution of power, creation of state police, review of resource control and revenue allocation formula, as well as strict adherence to federal character principle in federal appointments in the shared interests of the federating states.\n\n\u201cWe firmly back the demand for the establishment and activation of other ports in other states of the federation, particularly in the south where such services are in very high demand.\u201d\n\nAlso, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), yesterday, backed the decision of the southern governors banning open grazing in the area.\n\nThey described the move as courageous and strategic, urging them to ensure that they back it up with the necessary legislation; which is the most potent strategy to prevent the monstrous and murderous Fulani herdsmen from overrunning their states.\n\nADF said: \u201cThe law to be passed in the Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. The effectiveness of this move depends on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people including the civil society organisations.\u201d\n\nADF also drew the attention of the southern governors and legislators to the obvious fact that their fate in the current struggle for survival is intricately interwoven with the fate of their fellow compatriots in the Middle Belt and Southern Kaduna.\n\nMASSOB on its part, encouraged the southern governors and other leaders to sustain the southern unity and brace up for the defense of their indigenous people. Leader of the group, Uchenna Madu, noted that their decision had rattled the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and, therefore, urged them not to relent in their ban on open grazing and call for national dialogue.\n\nMASSOB assured the southern governors that Southeast and the people were solidly behind the latest moves of salvaging their people from the marauding Fulani-terrorist herdsmen being brought in from some West African countries to carry out Islamisation agenda.",

It is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\n\n\u201cWe should jointly pray against the tragic incidents of kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of our country as a united entity.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithfuls during the Ramadan. \u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities. These are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022IGP orders watertight security nationwide\n\nActing Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has ordered water tight security around the country to forestall security breaches as Muslims mark the Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nA statement by Frank Mba, force public relations officer, in Abuja, said the IGP\u2019s order was contained in a directive to assistant inspectors general of police (AIGs), commissioners of police (CPs) and other strategic commanders as part of efforts by the police leadership towards stabilising security, improving public safety and making the country a safer place for all citizens.\n\n\u201cBaba has ordered a nationwide deployment of police officers and other operational assets of the force for watertight security ahead of the Eid-el-Fitr celebration and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u2022PDP sues for unity, patriotism\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) has felicitated with Nigerians on the occasion of Eid-el-Fitr to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, urged Nigerians to use the opportunity of the celebration to unite in confronting the challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we are faced by all sorts of new surge in terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, vandalism; recklessness and insensitivity in governance as well as the menace of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, this is the time for Nigerians to keep hope alive believing that with trust in God and unity of all, this ugly phase in the life of our nation will surely pass.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi calls for prayers, sober reflection\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State called on Nigerians to take advantage of the occasion to reflect soberly and intensify prayers for the peace, security, unity and progress of the country.\n\nIn his Sallah message, Ugwuanyi, who felicitated with Muslim faithful, stressed that the religious event has great positive impact on the nation\u2019s efforts in surmounting its security, socio-economic and public health challenges.\n\nThe governor, therefore, enjoined Nigerians to continue to trust in God and embrace the cherished virtues of love, charity, peace and sacrifice as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Mohammed.\n\nWhile wishing Muslims the blessings and guidance of Allah, Ugwuanyi advised Nigerians on peaceful celebration and strict adherence to precautionary measures for the containment of the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\u2022Pray for peace, progress \u2013 Fayemi\n\nEkiti Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said the completion of the 30-day Ramadan fast was a rare privilege from the Almighty Allah on the faithful.\n\nThe governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, urged Muslims not to allow the lessons of sacrifice, humility, piety and submission to the will of the Almighty Allah learnt during the Ramadan season to go in vain.\n\n\u2022Ayade harps on peace and oneness\n\nCross River State Governor, Ben Ayade has congratulated Muslim faithful on the successful completion of the Ramadan fast.\n\nHe called on them to remain content and render selfless service to humanity in accordance with the lessons of the Islamic religious obligation.\n\nIn an Eid El-Fitr message to the Muslim Ummah by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, the governor said: \u201cEid al- Fitr offers an excellent opportunity for Muslims to break barriers and reach out to fellow Nigerians, heal wounds and work toward a united, peaceful Nigeria especially at this time our country is facing myriad of economic and security challenges. I enjoin muslim Ummah and indeed all Nigerians to employ a selfless approach in our dealings irrespective of religious, political or tribal affiliations and remain content with what we have.\u201d\n\n\u2022Tinubu tasks Muslims faithful on righteous acts\n\nAlso, All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, tasked Muslims to allow righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan guide their actions.\n\nTinubu, in a statement, yesterday said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding. We must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ramadan, window for national healing \u2013 Nwankwo\n\nAn aspirant in the Anambra governorship election, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chidozie Nwankwo, has called on disparate groups threatening the Nigerian federation to have a re-think by imbibing the spiritual lessons offered by Ramadan season.\n\nIn a message by his Media Adviser, Edward Dibiana, the governorship aspirant felicitated with the country\u2019s Muslim community for faithfully going through the fasting period, in spite of the harsh times.\n\nNwankwo, who is the Chairman/CEO of Wichtech Group, expressed hope that the country would yet again surmount the current challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cGiven the virtuous acts of piety imbibed during the Ramadan, I urge our kith and kin \u2013 currently led astray and operating as either Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers and the likes \u2013 to return to the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cEvery disagreement, be it in the family unit, business environment, community or country, is better resolved through dialogue. We must, therefore, use the opportunity offered by the Ramadan season to promote national healing, by forgiving ourselves. In deed, Allah\u2019s desire for humanity is peaceful and communal living, devoid of undue bickering. As true and faithful followers of God, we must join hands to ensure a restoration of peace in our land.\u201d\n\n\u2022Labour demands sacrifice from leaders\n\nOrganised labour has tasked leaders and citizens to make necessary sacrifice to rid the nation of the current grave insecurity.\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, in his Eid-el-fitr message said: \u201cWe must hear something, see something, say something and do something with every sense of love and patriotism to reclaim our dear motherland from the cataclysmic periphery that the enemies of Nigeria want us fall headlong into.\u201d\n\nWabba noted that the Eid-al-fitr takes place at a time that the country was plagued by fiery storms of insecurity, economic recession and social setbacks with very grievous consequences for workers.\n\nThe NLC president said labour also use the season of Ramadan to remember and salute members of the Armed Forces \u2013 the military, the police, the para-military agencies and the intelligence community \u2013 for their sacrifice, courage and commitment in the fight against terrorism and other forms of violent crimes.\n\n\u2022Pray for peace \u2013 Adegoke\n\nFormer Osun State gubernatorial aspirant , Kunle Rasheed Adegoke has felicitated with Muslims in the state on this year\u2019s Eid al-Fitr celebration which marked the end of the 2021 Ramadan.\n\nAdegoke, popularly known as KRAD, called on Muslims in the state to use the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr celebration to pray for the peace of Nigeria.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to continue with their closeness to Almighty Allah and their prayers for His intervention in the affairs of the country, even after the obligatory fasting period.\n\nHe stated that Ramadan does not just symbolise having a positive attitude during the fasting period, but represents a total change towards becoming good citizens who comply with the law and demonstrate patriotism at all times.\n\n\u2022Soun sues for peace\n\nSoun of Ogbomosoland, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi Ajagungbade III, has called on Muslim faithful across the country to pray for leaders at all levels of government.\n\nWhile felicitating with the Muslim Ummah, the first-class monarch, urged the political class to improve the common lots of the people.\n\nThe traditional ruler urged Nigerians to embrace forgiveness, togetherness and patriotism, adding that the traditional institution will continue to play its leading role in advocating peace and unity.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Private Secretary, Toyin Ajamu, Oba Oyewumi said: \u201cAs we celebrate Eid-el fitr, I call on Muslims across the country to sustain the teachings of the holy Quran and exemplary qualities of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in their pursuits. The festive season calls for sober reflection as individuals and as a people. People at the helm of affairs must prioritise the welfare of the people in their policy trust. As we mark Eid-el fitr, I implore Moslems to pray for the nation.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Atiku, Lawan, Saraki, Tinubu preach righteousness\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday went spiritual in the search for solutions to the insecurity ravaging the country with a call on Nigerians to pray for an end to banditry, kidnapping and desperate quest for power.\n\nBuhari, in a message he personally signed to celebrate Eid-el Fitr, urged Nigerians to shun the temptation to retreat into their communities.\n\nSimilar messages from former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu; and a former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, also tasked Nigerians on the need for righteousness and prayers for the nation to overcome its problems.\n\nBuhari implored the citizenry to pray against kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of Nigeria as a united entity.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile sending his best wishes to all Nigerians and Muslims across the globe as they mark the Eid Al Fitr the president said:\n\n\u201cUnity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges, which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithful during Ramadan.\n\n\u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities.\n\nThese are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also urged Nigerians to continue to observe all COVID-19 prevention measures and celebrate responsibly during the holidays.\n\nLawan felicitated with the Muslim clerics in Nigeria on the completion of this year\u2019s Ramadan fast, saying: \u201cEvery true Muslim feels joy at participating in the Ramadan fast, which is a key obligation in Islam. May Almighty Allah, therefore, reward us for the spiritual voyage and grant our earnest wishes for ourselves, families and dear country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, due to the current security and economic challenges, Nigeria needs the prayers of every patriot now more than ever before to achieve peace, unity, and progress were the dreams of the founding fathers.\n\nHe assured the people that the government, including the National Assembly, will not waiver in its determination to provide security for the people to allow law-abiding citizens the liberty to live in peace and pursue their legitimate businesses anywhere.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us remain strong in our hope that Nigeria will become what we fervently want it to be: a nation that fills its citizens with happiness and pride.\u201d\n\nTinubu also joined Muslims in marking the completion of Ramadan fast.\n\nIn a message issued yesterday by his Media Office, the former Lagos State governor stated that as Muslims, they had fasted and prayed in a special way during this holy month.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan must guide our actions and conduct going forward. Let us put politics aside and continue to pray to Almighty Allah for our country and its entire people.\n\n\u201cLet us remember President Muhammadu Buhari and his government in our prayers that they may be given the requisite strength and wisdom to protect the nation, defeat the challenges that confront us and help establish Nigeria as a more prosperous and just land.\u201d\n\nAtiku in a statement said this year\u2019s Eid-al-Fitr come at a time when Nigeria was going through challenging moments concerning the security of lives and property and when a large number of people were hard hit by the ravaging scourge of poverty.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, we need to remind ourselves of our obligation to ensuring peace and unity within our family and in our neighbourhood at all times.\n\n\u201cToday, across Nigeria, there is a scary and growing tendency to mistrust along ethnic and religious lines. As Muslims, we know from both the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Noble Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that no tribe or race is superior to another, except the one that seeks piety to the Almighty Allah,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the Head of his media office, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, said: \u201cThe current situation in our country requires a sincere change of mindset by all Nigerians. We should use this post-Ramadan period and the lessons we learnt from the fasting period to steer clear of any action which does not bode well for our country. This is a period when we all need to pray to Allah to once again pull the country back from the precipice.\n\n\u201cWith the level of insecurity and economic crisis which have combined to worsen the rate of poverty in Nigeria, all Nigerians must unite and demonstrate patriotism that will help our country overcome the present challenges.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I commend our security agencies at the frontline and pray that Almighty God will protect and give them victory over the insurgents and other non-state actors inflicting violence on our country. May Allah heal our land of any form of affliction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist outstanding allocations are paid\n\n\u2022Say pact must be backed by law\n\nBy Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nStriking judicial and legislative workers have given fresh conditions to suspend their industrial action, insisting that the federal government should prevail on governors to immediately release all outstanding allocations due to the other two arms of government, still in their custody since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe workers restated that they would not negotiate the provisions of the constitution on financial autonomy for the two arms of government and demanded that the governors should immediately set in motion the process of establishing the fund allocation committees in all the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) made the demands in a written response to the proposals made by state governors and the federal government on how to resolve the dispute over financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in each state of the federation.\n\nThe federal government and the governors of the 36 states had earlier agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the workers\u2019 unions at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, sought to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY had reported exclusively that under the new template, the governors would establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nBut in their response to the government\u2019s proposal, which was submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Tuesday, the striking workers also demanded that a law be immediately enacted to back the implementation of any agreement reached with the governors.\n\nA top official of one of the unions told THISDAY that the workers were also demanding that \u201cin consonance with the Executive Order 10, that whatever monies that are in the possession of the governors and are yet to be disbursed should be disbursed immediately.\u201d\n\nHe added that the unions are also insisting that there should be uniformity of the law setting up the fund allocation committees to ensure a common template for revenue sharing in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nThe official said: \u201cWe demand that there should be a law in all the states to back up the revenue-sharing template. In addition, in consonance with Executive Order 10, the governors should also ensure that whatever that is their hands that they have not disbursed are released. They should disburse it immediately. They should put in motion the process of setting up the State Fund Allocation Committee as proposed.\n\n\u201cThere should be uniformity in the law setting up the revenue sharing template in all the states. We don\u2019t want a variant of the law. It doesn\u2019t matter what a state generates. We know that every state will not have the same amount because some of the states earn derivation fund. What is important is that the sharing formula is the same.\u201d\n\nOn having the governors as signatories to any agreement reached to resolve the financial autonomy dispute, the source said JUSUN and PASAN insisted that each state governor should sign the agreement by himself and not through a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, in continuation of negotiations to end the dispute, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, on Tuesday held a meeting with the representative of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, on how to respond to issues raised by the striking workers.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting followed the receipt of a written response by the workers to an earlier offer made by the governors in a bid to resolve the lingering dispute.\n\nIt was learnt that Ngige, Lalong and others were not able to trash out the issues and had agreed to meet again yesterday (Wednesday) in order to allow for wider consultations.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that a meeting with the leadership of the workers may be convened tomorrow to iron out the remaining issues with a view to secure the suspension of the strike.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN have been on strike for over one month.\n\nThe unions are seeking the full implementation of the constitutionally guaranteed financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Again, prices near $70\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has picked 16 consortia for its new crude-for-fuel swap contracts for one year starting in August.\n\nA report yesterday by Reuters listed the consortia to include major Swiss trading firms, Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as large Nigerian traders, Sahara Energy, Oando and MRS Oil.\n\nOther companies which qualified for the contracts, according to a list sighted by THISDAY include: AY Mai Kifi, based in Kano; Litasco, a South African firm; Bono Energy, Lagos; Duke Oil, an NNPC subsidiary; Eyrie Energy, based in Abuja; Asian Energy Services; Prudent; BP and Mocoh.\n\nThe contracts, known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP), are coveted since they are used to supply nearly all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol needs as well as cover some of its diesel and jet fuel consumption.\n\nThe companies were invited on Friday to submit commercial bids, which were due on Tuesday, according to the report.\n\nThose involved in the process said the list of winners was unlikely to change substantially, with the new DSDPs expected to replace those from 2019, which were extended until mid-2021.\n\nTraditionally, if a foreign oil company wins, then it is typically paired with at least one local firm.\n\nNNPC uses a DSDP mechanism to secure Nigeria\u2019s fuel requirements in exchange for crude, a practice that has gone on for years as all the country\u2019s refineries have remained comatose.\n\nIn an interview last year, NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said the DSDP had resulted in savings of more than $1 billion a year since its introduction.\n\nNigeria relies almost entirely on imports to meet oil product demand because of significant and prolonged operational problems at its 445,000 bpd of refining capacity.\n\nThe country consumes over 350,000 bpd of petrol with the majority sourced from Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices rose yesterday on signs of a speedy economic recovery and upbeat forecasts for energy demand supported by vaccinations against COVID-19 although waves of infections in India and Brazil curbed gains.\n\nBrent crude climbed 83 cents, or 1.2 per cent to $69.38 a barrel, earlier in the day, with West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude rising 86 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $66.14.\n\nAs at yesterday evening, prices of Brent had hit $69.86, a few cents shy of the much expected $70 while WTI was at $66.56.\n\nIt coincided with a monthly report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which noted that demand for oil will exceed the output of top producers.\n\n\u201cThe anticipated supply growth through the rest of this year comes nowhere close to matching our forecast for significantly stronger demand beyond the second quarter,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nOil prices were also supported by the outlook from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which on Tuesday stuck to a forecast for a strong recovery in world oil demand in 2021, with growth in China and the United States, outweighing the impact of the coronavirus crisis in India.\n\nPrices were further impacted by data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group showing that U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to May 7.\n\nThe fall came before the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a cyberattack last Friday, forcing the shutdown of a pipeline that transports more than 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Kingsley Nwezeh\n\nChairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declosed that the anti-graft agency recovered $153 million from former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nHe said the agency also recovered the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million from the minister, who has been living in the United Kingdom, UK, since leaving office some years ago.\n\nBawa, who made the disclosure in the April Edtion of its in-house magazine, EFCC Alert, explained that the EFCC would want the former minister to face trial in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are several issues surrounding Diezani\u2019s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that.\n\n\u201cThe other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned,\u2019\u2019 Bawa said.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Federal High Court in Abuja had fixed May 17 for the EFCC to report on how it complied with the court order in the trial of Alison-Madueke.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had accused the former minister of fleeing the country to escape justice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He was a father of two, whose wife was also pregnant with another baby. Noel's crime was looking fresh and young and driving a new Toyota camry he just took delivery of. It has been over one week since he was killed and none of his killers has been detained.\n\n25-year-old Divine Nwaneri, an undergraduate of Imo State University was shot dead along Douglas Road by the military. Her only crime was walking close to the custodial centre. Nobody asked Divine to turn back, nobody arrested her for questioning. Nobody did anything to caution her, just a finger on the trigger and she was dead the next minute.\n\n\n\nA driver of a commercial bus was shot dead same style in Owerri. Nobody asked him any questions. To those who were laws unto themselves, he deserved nothing but death. Scores of other innocent people have been shot dead, unprovoked, by the military and police since hoodlums began testing the waters in South East's emerging hospitality capital.\n\nSince taking office through the ceiling, Hope Uzodinma has acquired more than 200 vehicles for the police, army, DSS. In that same period, the governor has done nothing in the area of human capital development. Teachers protest every day. Pensioners? Don't go there. Recent NBS data showed that Imo has the highest unemployment rate in the entire country.\n\nIf you still don't have a clue as to why hoodlums rule supreme in the state, just look at the economics.\n\nMy job is to present the issues the way they are in a bid to solve the problems and not to pander to anyone's emotions.\n\n*********\n\nSecurity agencies, mostly from the IRT, military SF and DSS raided Awo-Mmama in search of ESN commander, Ikonso. In the gunfight that ensured, four innocent villagers were killed alongside the ESN commander and one of his lieutenants. The military lost a Lieutenant, while three police officers were reportedly killed.\n\nWhile the raid on Awo-mmama was still raising dust, the military swooped on towns like Oguta and Ohaji, indiscriminately killing, arresting and detaining any young man of age; burning down houses of people who escaped their arrest, then engage in mass hysteria in the media to misinform the public.\n\nNigeria has always been at war with the South East. The rise of IPOB, and the lack of emotional intelligence by Kanu only provided another excuse for such war to continue. There is no nation that is governed by fear that makes any progress. Yet, Nigerian government has continuously applied the principles of fear to whip dissenting voices into line, especially in the South East, reason for the indifference our people exhibit when police officers are killed. The federal government should demilitarise the East to de-escalate tension and make economic concessions to dialogue with the people. Failure to do this will make it impossible for communities and security agents to work together and might spark another uprising in the Oil Rivers. It is a crisis that will leave everyone with bloody noses.\n\nThe mistake most people make when commenting on the indifference of the ordinary Igbos over the attacks on the police in Igbo land is seeing it as public support for these attackers. There is public perception of every issue, and then there is the real story.\n\nThe Nigerian police and the army are generally seen in the East as occupying forces because of their horrible human rights records; and their checkpoints as mere toll points. Mass arrests for huge bail money is rife. All of us know one or two persons who had been victims of this archaic way of policing. The attacks by herders and seeming indifference by security agencies to put an end to it, only exacerbated this animosity between the people and federal government's security agencies. It is why the coming of ESN was hailed as a fresh breath. Those blaming the people for how they react to these killings are not being sincere.\n\nIt was reported that checkpoints in the East generated over N100 billion between 2015 and 2018. During Christmas periods, security agents, including customs waylaid Eastern-bound travellers, confiscating rice and other grains they were taking home for their kinsmen, extorting huge sums and making their movements hard. Some of those grains were said to be later taken to IDP camps in the North East. Security agents killed scores of innocent persons at the checkpoints within the time in review. Between that same period, there were more than 30 attacks by herders in the region that security agents did nothing about.\n\nPolicing in the East is done mainly on busy roads where people are extorted regularly. It is why these hoodlums easily routed the police and forced them back to their decaying barracks, while they proved very incompetent in dealing with them. This is the real story.\n\nIf the police and the DSS have failed to arrest these gangs, mainly because they came to the East for business; not the business of fighting crimes but lining their pockets, is it Kenechukwu that will do the job?. To also earn the trust of the people, the police should change from an extortionate force to something more humane.\n\nThe ordinary people also know that the political class use the police to legitimise their wickedness and put them down. The police is seen as serving the elites. The class division as regards to the use of security agencies is why everyone is indifferent. So as the police have been cowed in the East, the political class worked too hard to see to the end of its legitimacy. If they are wise enough, they will know that they might be next, and then, the rest of us. It took the attack on Imo police and prison facilities for the South East leadership to read the handwriting on the wall and try to de-escalate tension and form a face-saving security outfit, something they should have done in 2017. I am sorry to announce to them that it is already too late. There can never be peace without justice. Justice in this sense entails standing up for the people, and truly speaking for them, then stealing less of the funds meant for them.\n\nIf you didn't see this day coming; a day when all the knuckles are off, then you were not paying attention enough. From ethnicization of appointments, to 97/5 percent dichotomy and asking the world bank to focus on the North, Buhari set the stage for the taking over of different parts of the country by armed non-state actors. The insincerity of the Buhari\u2019s administration by treating known terrorist groups like the herdsmen with kid gloves while killing other flies with sledge harmer brought out the beast in everyone.\n\nAs it stands, Buhari is writing Nigeria's epitaph, a doom foretold.\n\nThe Nigerian state has lost the monopoly of violence; the only thing it had relied upon to whip dissenting voices into line. For a government whose only approach to resolving any issue is violence, the more violent men are beating the state to a retreat.\n\nDemocracy in Nigeria has become a rotation of musical chairs among corrupt elites, marred by violence and fraud. That was why it was easy for the Nigerian state to lose the Weberain notion of \"monopoly of Legitimate force and control of territory\" to the deep state. Currently, 44 local governments in the North are under the control of terrorists. Nigeria is an Orwellian dystopia. Orwell's analysis in Animal Farm and 1984 are our current realities.\n\nThe militancy in South East and South-South likely has foreign support that helps them with training, intelligence and equipment. The swiftness with which they operate and the inability of the security agencies to track them tell enough. The first shot was fired in Ebonyi, then Imo, Cross River, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Enugwu and Rivers. For any group to operate in these areas for months unhindered should help you pierce the pieces together.\n\nThe governors, on their part, know that they have lost the plot. Some have left the government houses, hiding in hotels in state capitals or in Abuja. Power has been taken from them. Nigerian politicians rule with the brutality of the police, soldiers, DSS or anyone with arms, capable of arrest and detaining under the supervision of the law. Now, people who don't care about the law have cowed the police, soldiers, and the rest, thereby stripping the governors of their power. The question they have not asked, however, is \"how did we get here? How did we surrender the authority that we had so easily?\n\nThe political class in the East, and some states in the South South are currently as vulnerable as the rest of us; powerless, scared and concerned. They have been humbled and are waiting for Abuja to save them, not with dialogue or investment in human capital development of indigenes of their state but with military power. People like Uzodimma are paying back the loans they took to purchase the position they presently occupy. Others were guided by parochial individual interests. Understanding the principles guiding Nigeria's politics is key to eternal personal peace.\n\nFrom Umuechem, Odi, Zaki Ibiam, to Zaria, Nkpor, Onicha, Emene, Oyigbo, Aba and the Lekki toll gate, the government mastered the act of violence as the only means of dialogue. Amnesty International reported more than 300 people killed in the East in 2016, mainly IPOB members. Their political leaders only played politics with their corpses and that was it. No commission of enquiry was set up, none of their killers were charged to court. Families waited, the rest hoped that these families forget the brutal killing of their brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers. We never applied the rule of equal justice to their case and concluded within ourselves to move on.\n\nBut have we?\n\nWhen you view it with the fine eyes of a physician, you will see why some people rejoice when security agents are killed. Anyone who is denied justice will do anything to get a pound of flesh.\n\nNations are shaped in times of crises. Times like these help them to examine their approaches to governance, make necessary decisions and bring about changes that would put them on the path to progress. Many nations, prepared to learn, would have evolved since these issues came to national consciousness in 2016 by making regional political and economic concessions. But a nation where hypocrisy is government's official policy will keep sinking.\n\nIt has been argued that African leaders rarely embark on any reforms that will benefit the people that they are oppressing without a resort to violence. The continent of Africa suffereth violence and violent men taketh her by force. Nigeria had 50 years after the civil war to implement policies and political restructuring that would have put her on the path to progress but the leaders refused because a dysfunctional system is to their benefit. Here we are, terrorised, pauperised and afraid.\n\nThe most violent thing I have ever seen is the 1999 Constitution. But it took the coming of Buhari to amplify that violence. The former rulers of Nigeria knew how to manage her backwardness, but when Buhari came, all pretences were off, the Fulanisation policy of his administration birthed the chaos we are in.\n\nWhen you look at the entire black Africa, only few countries are not engulfed in one nationalist struggle or the other. From Nigeria to Cameroon, Chad, central African Republic, Senegal, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, it is murder, death, kill that simple reforms would have solved.\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, I have sat at different fora where most of the side discussions centred on attacks on police formations in the South East. Most times, as the only Igbo in the room, people ambush me with questions in a bid to understand the side that I am on. I am always asked if IPOB is responsible but if the governors with all their intelligence have not blamed the group, then who am I?\n\nFrom recent events, every Igbo is now a stakeholder in IPOB; whether he/she is a member or not. This realization shifted my attention about the group where I pay keen attention, and observe trends, especially behind the news headlines, deciphering truth from the group's propaganda and misinformation campaigns of the Federal Government and offer constructive criticism. You can not wish away the issues raised by the group. Most people disagree on methodology.\n\nAs an Igbo, whether you like it or not, you are a partaker in the group's wins, if any, and losses. It is the reality of the Nigeria we live in today. You can be a detribalized Nigerian all you want, but at the end of the day, Nigeria reminds you that you came from somewhere. Like they say \"Nigeria will happen to you\". The Igbos who lived in Oyigbo from October last year will testify to this. Those who escaped being lynched after Wike invited youth groups to the government house and emboldened them to fish out IPOB members in their communities understood without being told that despite the fact that they did not belong to the group, IPOB came to define them in the eyes of every other Nigerian. It is the proverbial one finger that has touched red oil and it has gotten to the mouth of every member of the community. It is why in search of perceived IPOB members, security agencies are carrying out mass atrocities in several parts of Imo State.\n\nThat is why we should continue to keep watchful eyes on IPOB, continue to criticise Kanu and his group to ensure they do not make further mistakes that will railroad us to perdition. IPOB on the other hand should learn to take criticism and not always resort to threats when one does not align with its approach. The herd mentality that is the group's current driving force is very dangerous to who we are as a people. Like Professor George Obiozor said, the Igbo do not speak with one voice but with different voices under an articulate leadership. Unless, IPOB is denying us our heritage, it should accept the disagreement.\n\nThe North has destroyed itself and currently feeds exclusively from the South. It is why Buhari\u2019s administration has not taken its usual kangaroo approach towards these rising trends, but is rather giving the governors the go-ahead to solve the problems. It is the reason for their recent turn around from beating the drums of war to a more pacifist approach and calling for reconciliation. A collapsed South East might collapse South South.\n\nMost people have dissected the rise of radicalism in the East without the flavour of looking at economic concerns and justice as key fuels to these rise in anti-goverment actions. Recent NBS data should worry all the leaders in the East but they are less worried about these trends and dismiss them with the wave of the hand while fixated on 2023 that might never come. Most of the recent nationalist struggles are rooted on injustice and economic strangulation.\n\nMy dissection of our present woes, the Igbo agitation in Nigeria, is anchored on the lack of justice, but only a few people appreciate this angle of thoughts. They are quick to remind you of the Igbo wealth in other places, how so and so percent of companies in Lagos are owned by Igbos, yet no other region was forced by carefully implemented policies to keep its wealth out of its shores like the South East. It is the only region that has no federal presence, except military and police build-up. Even the international airport has been taken away from the region, to continue to make it heavily dependent. If 5 Nigerians are leaving the country to go seek greener pastures, 3 out of those five are likely to be Ndigbo. This has, in no small measures, created a scarcity of young men and women in the communities, and makes it easier for Fulani herders to overrun them. Those who try to go into agriculture are creating feedstock for herdsmen. How much more can a people take?\n\nThe Igbo want to build their wealth in Igbo land and not forced to migrate to other places due to lack of infrastructure in the East. The Igbo understand that they have what it takes to rub shoulders with Singapore, Beijing, and the USA, and not Chad or Afghanistan that those who rule by military might dream of. The Igbo know that Nigeria as presently constituted, is a danger to her growth. Every generation moulds its own philosophy. It is why this generation, born several years after the civil war, wants to fight another war to secure its freedom. The war of the 60s was fought by intellectuals; Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Columbia grads. This one, I can't really tell. It is highly hypocritical to blame a people for wanting the best for themselves.\n\nIt is easy to disregard these concerns, especially when you are not the person who feels this sense of deprivation. This insecurity is as a result of these economic strangulation, and with a little sprinkling of radicalism, the result is our present state.\n\nIt was Louis Farrakhan who opined that \"There really can be no peace without justice. There can be no justice without truth. And there can be no truth, unless someone rises up to tell you the truth\".\n\nYet, Frederick Douglas's reminds that: \"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe\".\n\nJustice in the Buhari\u2019s Nigeria is shielding terror sympathisers like Isa patami, and terrorist groups like Fulani herdsmen but killing those who were flying only flags, proscribing them as a terror group. When you run them underground, whatever you see, you take.\n\nAs an Igbo, if you think that the unknown gunmen will stop at just killing police officers and politicians, then I am sorry for your self-loathing and ignorance. Fact is; these men will come for everyone directly or indirectly.\n\nWe all need justice. My father always told me that if you want your freedom, you should be ready to fight for it. But should it be done with arms, killing people, including children? I don't know.",

          "text": "Hakeem Odumosu, the Lagos state commissioner of police (CP), says Baba Ijesha would not be released from detention until the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) suspend its nationwide strike.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdumosu spoke on Wednesday while reacting to a protest led by Yomi Fabiyi to demand for the release of the embattled actor, whose real name is Olarenwaju James.\n\nTheCable Lifestyle had reported how the 48-year-old actor was arrested by the police for allegedly molesting a 14-year-old girl.\n\nJUSUN had on April 6 embarked on a nationwide strike in protest of the non-implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe industrial action had prevented courts from sitting \u2014 thereby making it difficult to arraign the Yoruba actor.\n\nBut the protesters had stormed the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti in Yaba to demand his release on bail.\n\nAccording to Odumosu, Baba Ijesha\u2019s continued detention is due to a directive of the directorate of public prosecutions (DPP) in the state ministry of justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen they got the SCIID today (Wednesday), they were advised by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the SCIID, and he told them that we have done our work and sought legal advice from the Ministry of Justice and the advice was that we should still keep him in our custody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we concluded our investigation, we forwarded our report to the ministry for legal advice. The ministry advised us through the Office of the Public Defender. The legal advice was that there was a prima facie case established against him and some sections of the law were quoted in the advice. So, the advice was that he should still remain in our custody and to be charged for that.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that the ministry might review its stance on the movie star\u2019s detention if the JUSUN strike continues to linger.\n\nThe CP added that an arrangement had been put in place in the state to enable courts to sit three times a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRegarding the JUSUN strike, they agreed to be working for three days and striking for two days. They will go on strike on Monday and Tuesday, while the courts will sit on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt was our hope that they would work on Wednesday, but coincidentally, Wednesday and Thursday are public holidays. But if the courts continue to remain shut, the Ministry of Justice may further review the report. But right now, we are relying on the advice of the ministry.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Adegoke Fayoade, who is in charge of the SCIID, urged the protesters to remain calm, adding that the actor\u2019s arraignment was delayed by the JUSUN strike.\n\n\u201cBaba Ijesha\u2019s case, as we are aware, has gone to the DPP. And the DPP has advised us on what to do. What we are waiting for is for the courts to resume; as soon as the courts resume, we will arraign him,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "title": "Seerbit\u2019s Omoniyi Kolade wants financial inclusion for all Africans",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I learned two things about the man. He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "title": "Despite $33 million Q1 revenue, Jumia\u2019s share price may take another nosedive after recent results",
          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "title": "The untold story of a Libya returnee: \u2026 10 men raped me for refusing to prostitute \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nMy name is Sarah Okoro (not real name). I\u2019m a Libya returnee. I returned December 2017. Reason for my travelling was that while still in Nigeria, after I lost my mum at a tender age, I became a single mother. I was actually working for someone, barbing hair. The guy I was working with who actually owns the place was the one that actually introduced me into this traveling issue. He told me that you can barb and make hair very well, in Libya, you can do this and get lots of money. So, he introduced me into it. The way they say it, it looks very easy, but it ends up in being not what they actually said it is. I said, no problem, I will go due to the difficulties I was passing through in Nigeria. I just decided to take the risk and I went. *In Libya, the experience I got there is not what even you will wish for your enemies. It was hell,* because, we spent a lot of time in the desert, trying to go to Libya, a lone country.\n\n*How I Left Nigeria*\n\nAfter we discussed about the travelling issue, I went to the guy to meet the person, because the person that was in Libya was communicating with me and telling me what to do. He gave the guy money to buy some stuff for me; some foodstuff and what I will need; Jalabia and all that; the things that we wear and all that. So, the woman told me not to tell my family that I\u2018m travelling; that most of the time, if you tell your parents you are travelling, they might discourage you from traveling. I didn\u2019t even tell my grand-mum who I was staying with then; so, I just wake up the fateful morning and went to the guy\u2019s place, from there, we went to Big Joe park at Ramat Park \u2013 Abuja \u2013 Kano. It was at a night journey. Actually, it was not easy. At first when we were in Nigeria, it was easy; I thought that\u2019s how it was going to be until we got to Gathrom. It was at Gathrom the journey actually started because, from there, it was no longer bus, but Hilux, because, they were going to load you like Titus (Sardine). They were going to load you inside. That was when the journey actually started because, when I was travelling, the person that was pushing me, which is my Burger, like they do say; he said I should not tell anybody that I was coming to Libya to work; that I should just tell them that my sister is in Libya, she just put to bed, that I am coming to do \u201c *Omugo* .\u201d So, if anybody ask me, that\u2019s what I do tell them. Everybody has his or her own story to tell; so, when I got to Agades, from there, they load us into Hilux. We were like between 20\u201330 people moved instantly. In that place, you will see about 1,000 Nigerian; it was a very big hall. Different tribes, name it, brought by different people. So, when I got there, I saw myself in the midst of many; I tried to make friends because in that desert, you don\u2019t know who is who. So, when we started the journey actually, it was hell. Before we even started, they gave me N5,000. They didn\u2019t tell me to use it to buy anything. They just said I should hold the money and when people are buying things, I will just be looking at the N5,000. But, thanks to God that I didn\u2019t use the money because, it really helped me. A lot of vehicles will capsize; some, their tyres will get spoilt, but our own, nothing happened to it until we got to Niger when our vehicle lost track and moving round in circle. I am sure he lost track; we got lost in the desert and stayed for about two more days in that place before he could reach someone and another Hilux now came and located us; we spent about a month and weeks before we got to Libya.\n\n*Experience in Libya*\n\nExperience in Libya was something else. When I got to Libya, the person I was staying with was very good to me, and very nice. She was a stylist. The first week, she was given me food and I was very happy; she had a kid. I was very happy, feeling at home always till one fateful day when I was at home. She asked me to go and dress up and do some shopping, because, she asked me not to take any cloth when I was coming because anything I wanted, cloths, shoes, that I will see it there. So, I did not carry any cloths. We went for shopping, she was buying cloths for me. She keeps buying all this short cloths. I then told her, Ma, there is cold in this place, please, how do you want me to use this? She said that I should not worry, that heat season will soon come; then I said Ok and I took it home. When I got home, the next day, she told me that I will be going to my working place. So, I was very happy hearing that alone, because I have stayed at home for about two weeks plus, doing nothing. When that day came, she said I should dress up and carry my bag and I said Ma, am I going to be staying in that place, she said no, that I should just obey her; so, I carried my bag and we entered a taxi. The man took us to one place; there was one small door, she just ask me to go in and that \u2018this is Libya, this is not Nigeria.\u2019 You just do your thing. You don\u2019t just work like that. So, I ran into the place, she didn\u2019t follow me and they closed the door and left. I was so surprised and wondered, is this the place? and I said, let me just walk through. The gateman directed me that I should go forward. As I was going, I saw one Ibo girl, very beautiful girl, she was wearing that same pant my burger bought for me; one of it, I saw another one coming; nobody needs to tell me that this place is a prostitution house. I was so surprised I now said this is not the place she told me she was actually bringing me to. Then, as I was just going, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s God or devil, as I just got inside, I dropped the bag. The owner of the place said I should come and sit down. Then one Ghana guy was seated there. The Ghana guy now spoke Arab. Then, I don\u2019t know how to speak Arab.\n\nThe Arab guy now spoke to the woman that he needs me. The woman now asked me to go and change \u2026 I said Ma, I can\u2019t do this work. This is not what we bargained. Before I even finished talking, I received several slaps on my face, beat me and was asking me series of questions, \u2018if my papa get company when he open for Libya when you wan come work, abi na your mama naim open saloon shop for Libya.\u2019 So, I was crying. I told them and was insisting that I was not going anywhere. She now saw how persistent I was that she was now using soft tone for me, like, no problem; sorry; just relax. I never knew they have something else for me. So, she just came to meet me and said Sarah, come. You said you want to go and see your Madam. Oya dress up. I now dressed, I was happy. I carried my bag, but she said I should leave it; \u2018your madam will come and carry it. I think you want to go and see your madam.\u2019 That was how I entered a vehicle. If only I knew that it\u2019s not what I was thinking, I would have just obeyed them and stayed there that day. So, I followed the vehicle; there was a Ghana guy in the vehicle. The woman told me that the guy was going to take me to my madam\u2019s place. My madam\u2019s house to that place was not that far. So, when we were going, I discovered that we didn\u2019t even follow the road that we followed earlier. I was now worried that this is not the road that we followed. He said I should not worry and asked if I am scared, I answered no, I am not; I was just trying to let you know that this is not the road we followed while we were coming to this place. He said I should just calm down, asking me questions to remove my mind from that thing I was saying. He was asking me what happened; I was now explaining. He said no problem; he wants to help me, making several commitments. That made me happy; when we just got to one place, he said I should come down. I now said this is not my madam\u2019s place; he said I should come down first. Immediately, I came down, I saw a Hilux in front of us. They took me into the Hilux and said I should sit in the Hilux. They carried me to the desert. When I got to the desert, I saw Arab people (soldiers). Holding gun (10 of them). When we got there, they asked me to come down and said I should pull my jalabia. They were not speaking English; it\u2019s only the Ghana guy that was hearing English, the rest of them were just speaking Arab. Then, I don\u2019t know how to speak Arab. So, whatever they were saying, I just try to nod my head because of the things I have heard about them. Everybody is scared of them. They were holding guns and using guns to tell me to pull my cloth and kneel down. So, I obeyed and pull my jalabia; while I was there struggling, 10 of the soldiers rapped me in that desert. They called my madam in my presence \u2026 and\u2026 (sobbing) \u2026\n\n*Life in Libya*\n\nIn Libya, actually, even when the person that is taking you there tells you that maybe you want to go and work, I don\u2019t really believe that there is anything like work in Libya. There is work; there is Arabu (working for Arab man). working for Arab man, but is very stressful; so, most Nigerians, I know of a girl who said that she prefers doing prostitution than to work for Arab man, because, while you are working for Arabu, you have to wash their ceilings, wash everything about their house. They will use you anyhow. So, a lot of girls don\u2019t want to do that, they just believe that the easiest way to make money in Libya is prostitution which is very bad. So, a lot of bad things are happening in Libya. I know of a girl they dis-virgin there in Lybia; with cucumba, they dis-virgined her in the desert. A lot of bad things are happening. In my presence when Asma boys came, Asma boys are those bad boys that burst your house, they will dress like soldiers, but they are not actually soldiers. They will take you to the prison and ask you to bring money, control money from Nigeria and all that. When they came, they burst the house and met the girl in the next room to my room. I was there holding myself and the people that were staying with me. They were just praying and all that.\n\nThe girl, they wanted to sleep with her, but she refused; they shot her in her private part and still, they took her to the prison; they throw her into the desert; only God knows what\u2019s happening to her. Whether she is dead or still alive, only God knows. So, alot of girls are suffering in Libya. You see some, they will leave Nigeria normal, but in Libya, they are mad. Sometimes, it could be the connection man, sometimes, the place they are staying, even doing prostitution. A lot of bad things are happening in Libya to girls and to boys; boys suffer more than girls. When I see our Nigerian guys in Libya, I respect them alot, because, they suffer alot. Some people will go to Libya with full body and comeback with one hand, one leg, different things. So who would want to see all this things and still want to go. It\u2019s not a good thing to travel to Libya by any means.\n\n*My journey back to Nigeria*\n\nI actually spent four years and some months in Libya; after my four years in Libya, I finished paying the person that brought me, I now decide to come back though, I tried crossing (to Europe). When I was trying to cross, they caught us on the sea there and took us to prison. The prison they took us to we escaped. While we escaped (12 of us) both pregnant women and all that, they took us into hiding; it was like a living house. I now said I can\u2019t hide there in Libya, not having rest of mind. I now said since I can\u2019t cross (to Europe), let me just go back to Nigeria.So, that was how we went to the Airport to write our names. We voluntarily came back to Nigeria. They said it\u2019s a free flight. That was how we actually came back with the help of IOM. We took a flight and were stopped in Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nWhen we came down at the Airport, we spent like three days; they lodged us in a hotel. They took care of us very well and after some time, I said, let me go back to my family and stay with them for some time because they said IOM was going to empower us then. They said we will go to the training and they will empower us. I came back to Benin. While I was in Benin, I went for the training in January. They said they will empower us, that was in 2018 because, I came 2017 December 26. It was from January I went for the IOM training. On completing the training, they said they were going to empower us with something so that we start up our business. I completed my training and they were asking us for invoice. They said they were going to group us. So, while they were grouping others, it was only me that was left because they grouped people into three. I was now left out because nobody was staying in my area because groups were formed based on area you are staying. Nobody wants to do the kind of business I want to do. I was now left out. So, when I complained, they said no problem, that they were going to put me in a group, that whenever a programme is coming up, they will call me, that I should go.\n\nGoing home, they will say come to the office; for four years, IOM did not answer me. So, I even forgot about them and was doing my thing myself. I now went to Lagos, I was doing house help, knowing that I have a daughter I am taking came of. I was doing house help, I went to Lagos with her doing house help there, trying to take care of her and sustain. One fateful day, I was trying to embark on this same journey \u2013 traveling back to Libya because, it was like, let me just go; if I die, I die, if I save, I save, than for me to be here seeing my daughter suffering.\n\nWhile I was trying to do that, I now saw a friend of mine that I know in Libya; we are attending the same church; I now saw him on Facebook with some IOM people and I chatted him up and said how far? You are in Nigeria?, he yes; I now said him, I am in Lagos; I am even planning to go back to Libya. So, when he heard that, he was now saying, why am I trying to go back to Libya. What happened? I now explained some of the things to him. He was now asking if IOM has paid me my money, I said no; for good three years now, coming to four years; I even stop disturbing them; he now said I should not do that, that IOM will pay me; that he was going to send my number and name to someone else; they will handle my case, I said ok, no problem. He now forwarded my name to Mr. Elijah, who now forwarded to Blessing, IOM staff; that was how December last year (2020), IOM paid me my money. This was someone that was planning to go to Libya. I was even thinking its scam -\u2018This boy wan just use sweet mouth for me make I for no go,\u2019 but, to God be the glory they paid me my money and I started my business again with happiness and joy; I have been happy. Since then, I am not thinking of traveling again.\n\nI am so happy that when they gave me my money, I did not just rush to go and get a shop. Because, I have seen so many returnees, even before I got paid; so many people, after paying them, they will just sell all the things and use it to do something else or maybe when they open a shop, one or two things will come up and I cant really find out while all these things are happening; but for me not to do this, when IOM paid me, I went for a three month training on how to do business; though, I had not collected the goods yet. I left the goods in my invoice.\n\nAfter I came back from the training, the street that I was staying in, the house that I was staying, in front of the house, there were about three shops there and if I didn\u2019t go for that training, probably, I would have gone to take that shop and say, let me just take up that shop and start up my business. After the training, I came to realize that that street that I was staying, my target audience were not there. Probably, if I had opened a shop in that place, I will keep grumbling that no customer, not knowing that I was the one that did not do my research well. After my research and all that, I discovered that I can actually work from home and I have been working from home, to gather more customers so that if I get those customers and go and open my own shop outside there, I know that I have gotten there.\n\n*Intention to return to Libya*\n\nThe reason I wanted to even travel back is that, in Nigeria here that is my country, I could not eat; when I was doing the house girl in Lagos, I will drink garri with my daughter. Garri is not my best food. If someone sees me, I will say I just like it; it\u2019s not because I like it, but because there was nothing to eat.\n\n...",

The questions they have tried to help us answer, first, is what should be the role of government in the healthcare system? Should the government be a provider of healthcare services or a regulator of people in the healthcare system, or both?\n\n\u201cIf the government is a provider, who regulates the government in its provision of healthcare services? Who pays for healthcare services? Does the government have all the money to pay or individuals through health insurance arrangements? Should it be compulsory? These are the fundamental questions existing today and we must try and find answers to these questions.\n\n\u201cPost-COVID-19, we are all trapped here as none can travel to get quality healthcare services and as such, we all should proffer solutions to these issues. We have to make our healthcare work for all of us. That is what this team is trying to make work for us. We are hoping that we can build a whole lot more consensus to help us provide a system that will help take care of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chairman of the health advisory team, Prof. Obehi Okojie, noted: \u201cWe are here to submit the report and recommendations in a bid to reposition the healthcare sector in Edo State for the good of the citizens of Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe report addresses major areas that drive the healthcare sector in Edo State, the Ministry of Health, Health Management Board, State Health Insurance Scheme and the Primary Healthcare Development Agency.

CIPM, Chartered Institute of Personnel Managers of Nigeria, is the umbrella body for the country\u2019s human resource professionals.\n\nThe Bank picked up two coveted awards, the \u2018People First CEO Award\u2019 and the \u2018People First Health and Safety Award\u2019, at the high-profile recognition ceremonies regarded as the \u201cOscars\u201d of Nigeria\u2019s Human Resources industry.\n\nBoth awards celebrate Abubakar Suleiman, Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Bank and the leadership of the Bank\u2019s Human Capital function, for putting employees first following the outbreak of the pandemic last year by ensuring a strong focus on the physical and mental health, welfare, and safety of employees.\n\nCIPMN presented the awards in partnership with the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), the chartered body and leading global membership organisation for safety and health professionals. IOSH is a champion, supporter, adviser, advocate, and trainer of those who protect the safety, health, and wellbeing of others.\n\nCommenting on the awards, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) of Sterling Bank, Temi Dalley, said, \u201cNavigating an unprecedented and globally challenging crisis such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a defining moment for organisational leaders in 2020. We are favoured at Sterling to have an ingenious leader who operates with a remarkable balance of wisdom and empathy.\n\nOur CEO displayed an exemplary range in how he led Sterling through the abrupt and relentless changes that the pandemic heralded. He acted beyond the role of a Chief Executive Officer in this period and was our Chief Humanist Officer, Chief Protection Officer, and Chief Motivation Officer. He tasked himself with the overall wellbeing and continued productivity of over 4,000 employees that constitute the Sterling workforce through a difficult time, never navigated before.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dalley, in the immediate outbreak of the pandemic, Sterling Bank\u2019s first response was the \u201cgo home, stay home\u201d advisory to employees regardless of role or essentialism of function. Constantly, communication of the \u201cSafety before Service\u201d mandate set for all employees occurred through multiple channels, with leaders bringing its true meaning alive by example.\n\nThe Bank did not leave employees to deal with problems arising from the pandemic alone. Avenue was created to report perceived exposure or symptoms of COVID-19 to the Wellness Desk for advice on further actions, including isolation and testing at the Bank\u2019s designated centres with costs borne by the Bank.\n\nApart from tailoring its policies to protect pregnant employees, nursing parents, and those with underlying illnesses, the Bank also factored in the health, safety and wellbeing of their aged parents and relatives.\n\nSterling\u2019s response to the pandemic placed its people first and adequately created a balance between employee safety and continued optimum performance. Its mentally and physically healthy workforce, working either fully remote, shift, or on-site, is a testament to that. Additionally, the Bank\u2019s employee engagement trust index increased from 81% in 2019 to 87% in 2020 with no life and job loss due to the pandemic.",

          "text": "I give all adoration and honour to our grand progenitor, the almighty God, for this great privilege of life and opportunity to witness today; I recognise Mr John Carrilo, Chairman of Global Facility Management Practitioners, I also recognise the Chairman, Board of Trustees, Mr Stephen Jagun and the National President, Mr Collins Osayamwen.\n\nOther members of the association here present, distinguished ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI am greatly delighted to address this assemblage of noble professionals in the business of facility management, point-blanky, this is a nostalgic moment for me, being an active member of this association before my expedition to partisan politics.\n\nI, therefore, considered it a great honour to be given this opportunity of making a keynote address on this special occasion of the 2021 World Facility Management Day Commemoration in Nigeria, with the unique theme: \u2018STANDING TALL BEYOND THE PANDEMIC- THE ROLE OF STRATEGIC FACILITY MANAGEMENT\u2019.\n\nSincerely, the theme of the event would not have been more relevant and apt than now, considering the pervasive trend of the novel coronavirus and its devastating impact on the global socioeconomic wellbeing.\n\nMoreso, the scary surge in the number of cases in Asia and Southern America, particularly India and Brazil, in the couples of weeks back left a lot to be desired in the quest for social security and economic advancement in the developing economies of the world.\n\nIdentifying human cases with onset of symptoms in early December, 2019, at a wholesale food market in Wuhan, China, the deadly virus, apart of becoming a global menace and a pandemic by its strength of spread also changed the paradigm of world order and compelled the global community to opt for a new normal.\n\nOf course, the adverse effects of the pandemic have seriously put governments of the world on their toes, regarding adequacy and sufficiency of social infrastructure, especially in the health sector, without the exception of the so-called advanced economies and matured democracies of Northern America and Western Europe.\n\nAs the scourge of the pandemic puts much pressure on the global seats of power, to look inward and strategize for better future, this challenge also threatens the actualization and attainment of the 17 identified Sustainable Development Goals and its 169 targets, most especially the third goal, which is \u2018Good Health and Well-being\u2019.\n\nHowever, these challenges are surmountable going forward, with conscious deployment of \u201d Planning and Management\u201d, which remain the core of Strategic Facility Management.\n\nSince strategic facility management solely rooted in management and planning, with focus on a set of clear-cut goals on the long-term for better future, it is therefore a preferable path from the wilderness of pandemic to a promise land of social inclusion and pragmatic leadership at all levels of government.\n\nThe inherent philosophy of strategic facility management in the face of the pandemic will provide direction to political class to harness nations\u2019 resources to critical sectors of the economy, in line with their varying economic advantage theory.\n\nThis philosophy will essentially instill the discipline of frugal management of resources for greater outcome in the political players and the propensity to invest for rainy days and for rapid socioeconomic development.\n\nAlso, the instrument of planning and management will provide necessary ideological concept of technology-driven development, in tandem with global trend of developmental agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, this philosophy, intrinsically presents dimensional safety protocol of socioeconomic model, which goes beyond physical safety protocols of wearing masks and social distancing among many others.\n\nIt is indeed a \u2018Psychological Protocol of Survival\u2019 in the face of the pandemic and post-pandemic era. As a matter of importance and exigency, we must start to observe these psychological protocol, which is cognitive interpretation of the gains of the pandemic above its embedded adversity.\n\nIt is indeed fundamentally instructive for governments around the world to embark on advocacy of social reorientation for the purpose of reshaping the psyches of their citizens towards this psychological protocol of survival, as the pandemic continues to reappear in series with little or no potent solution in sight.\n\nOn a final note, I am happy to tell you that the deployment of the dual models of physical and psychological protocols of COVID-19 in the State of Osun, has helped us immensely to effectively manage the menace of coronavirus with resultant moderate cases and minimal fatality, despite the incursion of 127 returnees from Ivory Coast into the state at the peak of the outbreak.\n\nOur amiable Governor, Mr Adegboyega Oyetola and myself as the Chairman of the COVID-19 Task Force in the state, alongside members of the cabinet worked assiduously through proactive interventions to stem the tide of the ravaging virus.\n\nObviously, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to attain this feat without effective planning and management, as a robust tool for standing tall above the dreaded pandemic.\n\nI thank you so much for your rapt attention.\n\nBEING A KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY HIS\n\nEXCELLENCY, BENEDICT ALABI, OSUN\n\nSTATE DEPUTY GOVERNOR, AT THE 2021 WORLD FACILITY MANAGEMENT DAY COMMEMORATION IN NIGERIA, ORGANIZED BY ASSOCIATION OF FACILITY MANAGEMENT PRACTITIONERS IN NIGERIA.\n\nDATE: MAY 12, 2021\n\nVENUE: ONLINE",

All major cryptocurrencies had seen major setback in their prices with some losing as much as 18 per cent compared to Wednesday\u2019s value.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalisation had likewise dropped and market capitalisation dropped to $2.1 trillion an 11.96 per cent decline from $2.43 trillion. The price of Bitcoin which was around $56,840 as at Wednesday afternoon had seen a sharp decline to $48,922 as at 10am on Thursday, as $7,918 was wiped away from its share price, a 14.17 per cent depreciation.\n\nThe price of Ethereum had declined by 13.29 to $3,728 while the price of Binance Coin and dogecoin had depreciated by 14.55 and 21.62 per cent in less than 24 hours.\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk had put up a Tweet survey asking followers if Tesla should receive Dogecoin as payment for its cars which many respondents answered yes.\n\nBy Thursday morning, Musk Tweeted that Tesla is \u201cconcerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is not issued by a single entity like a central bank. Instead, it is maintained by a network of so-called \u201cminers.\u201d These miners use purpose-built computers that require a lot of energy to solve complex mathematical puzzles in order for bitcoin transactions to go through.

          "text": "AGENCY REPORT\n\nAfter the drizzle that had been falling all night finally stopped after breakfast, Chen Yuanfu and Chen Yuanyang, two brothers who live in a small village in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou province, took out their equipment to make short videos about their stockaded village.\n\nIn their short videos, they would film family members and record interesting stories in the village, which is called Butang villagers\u2019 group.\n\nLocated in the hinterland of the Wumeng Mountains, Butang villagers\u2019 group in Gamu neighborhood, Bailidujuan administrative district of Guizhou\u2019s Bijie city, used to be basically isolated from the outside world due to the high mountains and dense forests.\n\nLast year, the two brothers quit their jobs in the cities, returned to their hometown and started to create short videos, something they had never imagined in the past.\n\n\u201cWe could only get one channel on TV after installing the fishbone antenna high in the air, let alone making phone calls,\u201d recalled the brothers.\n\nAccording to Chen Yuanfu, when he was in elementary school, he was once poisoned after eating a kind of wild fruit, and his fellow villagers had to run several miles in the mountains to send him to a hospital.\n\nBefore finishing middle school, the two brothers left their hometown to work in other provinces. Back then, since communication device was still scarce in Butang, every time they wanted to talk to their parents by phone, they needed to first reach an acquaintance who lives in the nearest town, and then ask the acquaintance to bring their parents over to pick up the phone at an agreed time when they came to the town to buy things.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2008, Chen Yuanfu bought his first mobile phone with nearly two months\u2019 salary. However, when he returned home for the Spring Festival that year, the mobile phone, which he thought would make his friends so envious of him, couldn\u2019t find any signal in the small village.\n\nA few years ago, the two brothers learnt how to make short videos. They wanted to make videos of the landforms and scenery of their hometown and post them online, but the idea was not realized because of poor signal.\n\nIn 2019, the over 280 residents of 62 families of Butang villagers\u2019 group finally saw a turning point in the communication situation when Guizhou province started to implement the fifth batch of pilot projects for universal telecom services and planned to build 3,513 4G base stations in five cities and autonomous prefectures including Bijie, in a bid to cover remote mountainous areas with 4G signals.\n\nTo make more residents benefit from 4G signals, the branch of China Mobile Group Guizhou Co., Ltd. in Bailidujuan administrative district decided to locate a base station on the top of an about 300-meter-high mountain behind the house of the two brothers.\n\nTo the surprise of Ge Zhixian, manager of the branch of China Mobile Group Guizhou Co., Ltd. in Bailidujuan administrative district, the construction of the base station in Butang villagers\u2019 group took much longer than expected 20 days or so.\n\nThere was no road to the top of the mountain, and it took technicians one and a half hours to climb up the mountain. Besides, they could find no way to use large-scale machinery and equipment for the construction.\n\nEventually, the construction team found a local transport team that carried things with mules and horses. The construction materials were then carried to the mountain top bit by bit on the backs of mules, horses, and people.\n\nAfter three months of painstaking efforts, the 4G base station was completed by the end of 2019.\n\nSince it got stable network coverage, the quiet Butang villagers\u2019 group has quickly become boisterous as villagers had broadband installed at their homes and started a craze for smart phones and TV sets.\n\nMeanwhile, Chen Yuanfu and his brother Chen Yuanyang decided to stay in their hometown and start their own business. Within about a year, they created more than 300 short videos, and attracted several hundred thousand followers. One of their videos has gained more than seven million views.\n\nAs they have been known by more and more people, some companies and shops in their county began to ask them to advertise their products, according to the brothers, who said that their income is more than what they used to make as migrant workers.\n\nAt present, the two brothers, who are basically Internet celebrities in their hometown, are preparing themselves for rural e-commerce. They want to promote local specialties on online shopping platforms and help increase the income of their fellow villagers.\n\nIn fact, just like Butang villagers\u2019 group, many villages in remote mountainous areas of Guizhou have achieved leapfrog development because of access to the Internet.\n\nDuring China\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) period, Guizhou took part in the implementation of five batches of the country\u2019s national pilot projects for universal telecom services, completed the construction and transformation of the optical fiber facilities in 8,900 administrative villages, and newly built 5,047 4G base stations. By the end of last year, Guizhou had covered all its natural villages with more than 30 households with 4G networks.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana and Igho Akeregha, Abuja\n\nSouthern Senators Forum (SSF) has fully endorsed all resolutions on burning national issues taken by their governors at a meeting in Asaba, Delta State on Tuesday.\n\nThe lawmakers aligned with the state executive\u2019s position on call for convocation of a national conference, establishment of state police and banning open grazing of cattle.\n\nThis is also as members of the House of Representatives from the 17 Southern states of the federation have thrown their weight behind Governors of the region who took a position to ban open grazing of cattle while insisting on restructuring and equal treatment for all Nigerians.\n\nThe senators submitted that banning of open grazing would help in reining in those hiding under cattle grazing to unleash terror of kidnapping and killing on the residents of the region.\n\nSouthern Governors Forum (SGF), had at its meeting held in Asaba, Delta State capital, on Tuesday, unanimously passed a verdict prohibiting open grazing in the region to checkmate herders-farmers clashes and senseless kidnapping as well as killings of Nigerian citizens of southern extraction.\n\nA statement jointly signed by the SSF Chairman, Secretary General and Publicity Secretary, Senators Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti), Mathew Uroghide (Edo) and Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu), respectively and made available to journalists in Abuja and Ado Ekiti, on Wednesday, appaluded the step taken by the Governors, saying it would serve as a buffer to wanton destruction of farmlands, kidnappings and carnages .\n\nThe senators lamented how the southern farmers were losing hundreds of millions of naira to plundering of food crops through encroachments on farmlands and exposing the region to famine and acute food scarcity.\n\nThey said: \u201cAt this critical point of our national life when the economy was being bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens.\n\n\u201cAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\n\u201cMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping, raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\n\u201cWith this uniform resolve by our Governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914.\u201d\n\nThey saluted the governors for ruminating on the expediency and the need for speedy restructuring of the highly lopsided Nigerian nation, saying this will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\n\nThe SSF stated that ushering of equality, equity and justice in the way the country is being run will wipe out ethnic tension, restore peace and stability and ward off agitations for secession that are now gaining tractions across the land.\n\nFinally, the Southern Senators Forum encouraged the governors to swiftly follow up on their resolutions by immediately approaching the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to working with the two arms of the parliament to ensure that their well articulated positions on the state of the nation, especially as relate to restructuring, state policing and the jettisoning of archaic traditional grazing methods, which fall short of global best practice standard and a potential threat to our national cohesion and peace, are thoroughly and decisively addressed through the ongoing constitutional review exercise.\n\nAlso backing the position of Governors of the region 22 members of the House of Representatives from Southern Nigeria who issued a statement on Wednesday in Abuja on behalf of their colleagues said after due considerations, they unanimously support the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum on the demand for true federalism, restructuring as well as the worsening insecurity in the country, among others.\n\nThey said this position is in firm restatement of their insistence that the country must exist and be governed on the platform of democratic tenets of social justice, equity, fairness, mutual respect, true federalism, rule of law and constitutional order.\n\nThey maintained their preparedness to deploy all legislative instruments at its disposal for the actualization of the demands.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the House of Representatives members including Honourables Ndudi Elumelu, Peter Akpatason, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, Toby Okechukwu, Adesegun Mujid Adekoya, Dolapo Badaru, Jimoh Ojugbele, Femi Fakeye, Segun Odebunmi, Mayowa Akinfolarin and Olufemi Bamisile on behalf of other lawmakers from the South, expressed firm support for the governors on the immediate ban on open cattle grazing across the Southern region of Nigeria.\n\nWe hold that such is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements which has heightened security challenges with escalated killings and bloody attacks on innocent citizens, while crippling social life, economic activities and food production in the region.\n\nWe therefore support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\nThe platform of Southern members in the House of Representatives said they also support their governors\u2019 restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring that will lead to the devolution of power, creation of state police, review of resource control and revenue allocation formula, as well as strict adherence to federal character principle in federal appointments in the shared interests of the federating states.\n\nThe statement added that \u201cAs lawmakers, we affirm that such is the only guaranteed way to ensure fairness, justice, equity to engender national stability, productivity and peaceful co-existence and we support an urgent national dialogue in that regard\u201d.\n\nThey cautioned individuals kicking against the call for devolution of power and review of revenue control and allocation formula, to desist from their vested parochial interest and note that such reviews are the only way to stabilize the country and engender regional or state productivity and heathy development at all levels.\n\nThe lawmakers commended the governors for their concern for the asphyxiation of economic activities in Southern Nigeria resulting from the continued congestion in ports in Lagos and the gridlock on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway.\n\nThis challenge has led to losses in billions of naira to businesses and other economic activities in the industrial and commercial activities of not only in the Southern Nigeria but the nation at large.\n\nWe therefore firmly back the demand for the establishment and activation of other ports in other states of the federation, particularly in the south where such services are in very high demand.\n\nAs lawmakers, our platform assures of our readiness to deploy our legislative instruments to ensure speedy achievement of the reforms and constitutional amendments that will guarantee a restructuring towards the practice of true federalism in our country and we are rallying our colleagues from other parts of the country in this direction.\n\nThe statement urged all Nigerians to see the larger picture and ensure that all hands are on the deck to move the country in the right direction.\n\nThe Southern lawmakers applauded Governors of the region for their patriotism and courage while commending Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State for hosting his colleagues in their quest for solutions at this critical time in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nOther lawmakers from the South who endorsed the statement are Honourables Oluwole OKE, Victor Nwaokolo, Kingsley China, Essien Ekpeyong Ayi and Fred Agbedi.\n\nOthers are Francis Charles, Patrick Asadu, Lynda Ikpeazu, Sylvester Ogbaga, Nkem Abonta and Jerry Alagboso.",

          "title": "SUSTAINING ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT THROUGH FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND ENERGY ACCESS",
          "text": "Financial inclusion and provision of sustainable energy is at a turning point in Africa\u2019s largest economy, Nigeria. With a population of over 200 million, about 50 per cent of the total population live in rural areas, and only 39 per cent of those living in rural communities have access to electricity. This is in addition to over 40 per cent of the entire population who are financially excluded or underserved.\n\nHowever, the proliferation of digital financial services in Nigeria \u2013 powered largely by growth in fin-tech companies \u2013 has catalysed an unparalleled increase in the current number of people with access to formal financial services, while further opening up opportunities to address power supply challenges across rural communities; a major feat instrumental towards achieving the broad Sustainable Development Goal 7. With over 200 fin-tech companies in operation within its borders, Africa\u2019s largest economy has found a way to target and capture over 40 per cent of its financially excluded or underserved population.\n\nIn a conversation with Adebola Sanni, co-founder, Infibranches Technologies and the Group Head, Business Development & Partnerships at Swifta Systems and Services, she highlighted the growing awareness about the transformative power of fin-tech and how if properly harnessed can help address both problems of financial inclusion and the more pressing sustainability challenges in the area of affordable and reliable power supply needed to drive the growth of local economies.\n\n\u201cFintech has increasingly provided innovative ways to address existing gaps in the availability, accessibility and use of finance particularly among the unbanked population. By leveraging the proliferation of technology, agent banking and mobile money solutions now offer affordable, instant, and reliable transactions, savings, credit across rural communities where no bank had ever established a branch. Similarly, about 75 million Nigerians who mostly fall within the financially underserved or excluded demography live without reliable electricity access as the existing electrical grid serves largely the country\u2019s urban population.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand how pivotal the provision of sustainable power is to driving growth of local economies in rural communities and by extension the need to boost financial services penetration across these communities. These are both enablers for catalysing positive transformation and driving sustainable economic progress across the country.\u201d\n\nAdebola, a leading business strategist and technology consultant also said, \u201cTo address these challenges, we believe distributed energy solutions that leverage digital payments will open up opportunities to reach the underserved market at low cost.\u201d\n\nWe partnered NGOs, including Shell Foundation, USAID, to extend agent networks together with off grid energy providers in 2019 where we set up about 200 agent locations across Nigeria, identifying communities across the rural and peri-urban regions with needs for both power and financial services. We also partnered renewable energy companies such as Green Light Planet (Sun King), D.Light Solar, Sosai, PAS BBoxx, Konexa to set up payment points necessary to expand access to highly subsidized power for such communities.\n\n\u201cThis solution provides affordable home solar systems to rural communities with an affordable and convenient payment structure where beneficiaries pay as low as N500 (less than $2 dollar a month) which allows for people to pay off the cost in a year to fully own the solar equipment.\u201d\n\nTill date, over 400,000 people have been impacted across 22 States and 108 local government areas in Nigeria through various initiatives supporting energy access especially in rural areas. The addition of the \u2018Solar Power Naija project\u2019 by the Federal government initiative under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) and managed by REA, for off-grid communities, will further expand energy access to 25 million individuals through the provision of Solar Home Systems (SHS) or connection to a mini grid. This is a good initiative to help expand energy access faster.\n\nOne of the success stories underpinning how providing innovative energy solutions can transform communities is the Havenhills mini-grid project in Kigbe community located in Kwali Local Government Area Council, Abuja. Before executing the project, the Kigbe community with geographical limitations had no electricity as they were completely off-grid. The project upon completion delivered a 20KW solar enabled mini-grid through 3km 3-phases and 1-phase grid lines to 145 homes, enabling them to power basic electrical appliances such as light bulbs, fans and TVs. The project also supports 5 local businesses including a barbing salon, grocery store and viewing center.\n\nAs part of creating sustainable economic empowerment, Adebola Sanni, who has strong passion for financial inclusion and energy access, has facilitated the implementation of a pioneer digital infrastructure that supports micro insurance, pension and savings providers and the first API infrastructure that aggregates renewable energy products and services making them accessible to any payment service providers, banks and other financial and non-financial institutions.\n\nShe is vastly experienced in driving growth, creating market focused products and providing innovative solutions to businesses in Financial Technology, eCommerce, Telco and Private/Publics sectors as well creating partnership opportunities for growth.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Financial inclusion and provision of sustainable energy is at a turning point in Africa\u2019s largest economy, Nigeria. With a population of over 200 million, about 50 per cent of the total population live in rural areas, and only 39 per cent of those living in rural communities have access to electricity. This is in addition to over 40 per cent of the entire population who are financially excluded or underserved.\n\nHowever, the proliferation of digital financial services in Nigeria \u2013 powered largely by growth in fin-tech companies \u2013 has catalysed an unparalleled increase in the current number of people with access to formal financial services, while further opening up opportunities to address power supply challenges across rural communities; a major feat instrumental towards achieving the broad Sustainable Development Goal 7. With over 200 fin-tech companies in operation within its borders, Africa\u2019s largest economy has found a way to target and capture over 40 per cent of its financially excluded or underserved population.\n\nIn a conversation with Adebola Sanni, co-founder, Infibranches Technologies and the Group Head, Business Development & Partnerships at Swifta Systems and Services, she highlighted the growing awareness about the transformative power of fin-tech and how if properly harnessed can help address both problems of financial inclusion and the more pressing sustainability challenges in the area of affordable and reliable power supply needed to drive the growth of local economies.\n\n\u201cFintech has increasingly provided innovative ways to address existing gaps in the availability, accessibility and use of finance particularly among the unbanked population. By leveraging the proliferation of technology, agent banking and mobile money solutions now offer affordable, instant, and reliable transactions, savings, credit across rural communities where no bank had ever established a branch. Similarly, about 75 million Nigerians who mostly fall within the financially underserved or excluded demography live without reliable electricity access as the existing electrical grid serves largely the country\u2019s urban population.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand how pivotal the provision of sustainable power is to driving growth of local economies in rural communities and by extension the need to boost financial services penetration across these communities. These are both enablers for catalysing positive transformation and driving sustainable economic progress across the country.\u201d\n\nAdebola, a leading business strategist and technology consultant also said, \u201cTo address these challenges, we believe distributed energy solutions that leverage digital payments will open up opportunities to reach the underserved market at low cost.\u201d\n\nWe partnered NGOs, including Shell Foundation, USAID, to extend agent networks together with off grid energy providers in 2019 where we set up about 200 agent locations across Nigeria, identifying communities across the rural and peri-urban regions with needs for both power and financial services. We also partnered renewable energy companies such as Green Light Planet (Sun King), D.Light Solar, Sosai, PAS BBoxx, Konexa to set up payment points necessary to expand access to highly subsidized power for such communities.\n\n\u201cThis solution provides affordable home solar systems to rural communities with an affordable and convenient payment structure where beneficiaries pay as low as N500 (less than $2 dollar a month) which allows for people to pay off the cost in a year to fully own the solar equipment.\u201d\n\nTill date, over 400,000 people have been impacted across 22 States and 108 local government areas in Nigeria through various initiatives supporting energy access especially in rural areas. The addition of the \u2018Solar Power Naija project\u2019 by the Federal government initiative under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) and managed by REA, for off-grid communities, will further expand energy access to 25 million individuals through the provision of Solar Home Systems (SHS) or connection to a mini grid. This is a good initiative to help expand energy access faster.\n\nOne of the success stories underpinning how providing innovative energy solutions can transform communities is the Havenhills mini-grid project in Kigbe community located in Kwali Local Government Area Council, Abuja. Before executing the project, the Kigbe community with geographical limitations had no electricity as they were completely off-grid. The project upon completion delivered a 20KW solar enabled mini-grid through 3km 3-phases and 1-phase grid lines to 145 homes, enabling them to power basic electrical appliances such as light bulbs, fans and TVs. The project also supports 5 local businesses including a barbing salon, grocery store and viewing center.\n\nAs part of creating sustainable economic empowerment, Adebola Sanni, who has strong passion for financial inclusion and energy access, has facilitated the implementation of a pioneer digital infrastructure that supports micro insurance, pension and savings providers and the first API infrastructure that aggregates renewable energy products and services making them accessible to any payment service providers, banks and other financial and non-financial institutions.\n\nShe is vastly experienced in driving growth, creating market focused products and providing innovative solutions to businesses in Financial Technology, eCommerce, Telco and Private/Publics sectors as well creating partnership opportunities for growth.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City will be played at Porto\u2019s Estadio do Dragao on May 29, UEFA has confirmed.\n\nUEFA had wanted to move the final to Wembley and was in talks with the UK Government, but there was a considerable sticking point over waiving quarantine rules for the 2,000 staff, sponsors, VIPs and foreign media.\n\nThe fixture was due to take place at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, but pressure mounted for the venue to be changed after the UK government placed Turkey on its \u2018red\u2019 list of at-risk countries and urged fans not to travel for the fixture. UK citizens returning from red-list countries are required to quarantine at a government-approved hotel for 10 days.\n\nUEFA confirmed 6,000 City and Chelsea fans will be allowed to attend although the overall stadium capacity is still to be finalised.\n\nPortugal is on the government green list so UK visitors will be able to travel there from Sunday. They will not need to quarantine but they will have to take Covid-19 tests before and after they travel.\n\nExplaining the move, UEFA said in a statement: \u201cAfter a year of fans being locked out of stadiums, UEFA thought that everything needed to be done to ensure the supporters of the two finalist teams could attend. \u201cUEFA discussed moving the match to England but, despite exhaustive efforts on the part of the Football Association and the authorities, it was not possible to achieve the necessary exemptions from UK quarantine arrangements.\n\n\u201cThe Portuguese authorities and the FPF stepped in and worked quickly and seamlessly with UEFA to offer a fitting venue for the final and, as Portugal is a green list destination for England, fans and players attending the final will not have to quarantine on their return home. \u201cThe decision does not come without big regret for the work that the Turkish football authorities have done over the last two years to ensure the successful staging of the final in Istanbul. UEFA is grateful also for their continued partnership and cooperative spirit as well as the understanding they showed in this particular circumstance and will urgently look into future opportunities for the city of Istanbul.\u201d\n\nUEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin said: \u201cI think we can all agree that we hope never to experience a year like the one we have just endured. \u201cFans have had to suffer more than twelve months without the ability to see their teams live and reaching a Champions League final is the pinnacle of club football. \u201cTo deprive those supporters of the chance to see the match in person was not an option and I am delighted that this compromise has been found. \u201cAfter the year that fans have endured, it is not right that they don\u2019t have the chance to watch their teams in the biggest game of the season. \u201cOnce again we have turned to our friends in Portugal to help both UEFA and the Champions League and I am, as always, very grateful to the FPF and the Portuguese Government for agreeing to stage the match at such short notice.\u201d\n\nCeferin\u2019s statement continued: \u201cThe Turkish football federation and the Turkish authorities have recognised the UEFA\u2019s efforts to give fans of the competing clubs a chance to watch the game. The Turkish Football Federation and the authorities have always been reliable partners of UEFA and Turkey has hosted many UEFA events over the years with great success. I hope to be in Istanbul and Turkey for a Champions League final and many other events in the near future. \u201cI hope the final will be a symbol of hope at the re-emergence of Europe from a difficult period and that the fans who travel to the game will once again be able to lend their voices to showcase this final as the best in club football.\u201d This will be the third final in Portugal in eight years but the first in Porto.\n\nSky Sports",
