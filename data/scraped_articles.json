He isn\u2019t one to go to joints and night clubs, like previous boyfriends. He is solvent, having lived with his parents since three years ago when he got divorced.\n\nIn every way, he\u2019s the man I\u2019ve dreamed of being with. We\u2019ve been together for close to a year and I was gutted when he formally moved out of his parents\u2019 house into a flat on his own.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he ask me if I wanted to move in with him or suggest us pay8ng for a flat together? I\u2019m 24 and currently share a flat with two friends, who are also baffled.\n\nREAD ALSO Oil Spill: Agip shuts down Idu Well 11 in Bayelsa\n\nI need to know whether he sees his future with me or if he\u2019s still pining for his ex-wife. Perhaps if I tell him I want to have a baby with him, I\u2019ll be able to find out. What do you think?\n\nTejiro, by e-mail.\n\nDear Tejiro,\n\nStop making assumptions about him that being older means he\u2019s ready to settle down. He\u2019s had a failed marriage and, if he has any sense, he\u2019ll be more cautious. You got him on the rebound and so, without a shared residence you think you\u2019re second best to his ex-wife.\n\nLess than a year is too early to be pushing for life-long commitments. Slow down. Date but with less intensity. Give yourself an independent life and (a) he\u2019ll get enough space to miss you; (b) he\u2019ll realise he need not be all things to you \u2013 his current position could be scaring him off greater commitment; (c) you\u2019ll feel you\u2019re a worthwhile, loveable person in your own right and unfazed by the ex. So, forget baby talk now. You don\u2019t have to abandon your dreams, you just have to learn to take your time to achieve them.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

What this means is that they also want a conducive environment to do their business.\n\n\u201dSo, NALDA is going to engage them and the communities; we will create an avenue where they can feed their cattle so that we all can live in peace,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe National President, Maize Association of Nigeria, Dr. Bello Abubakar said maize farmers in the country were currently producing enough to meet the demand for maize in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar however stated that more needed to be done to sustain the achievement, noting that one of such was to provide good environment for farmers to work.\n\nHe said that in order to achieve the desirable environment, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism must stop.\n\n\u201dOur farmers can not go to their farms because of fear of being kidnapped, robbed and killed,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to sustain the ban on maize importation so as to further boost its production and encourage farmers.\n\nHajia Salamatu Garba, Executive Director, Women Farmers Advancement Network said despite the current issue of insecurity, farmers across the country had been toiling hard to ensure availability of food on every Nigerian table.\n\nGarba said there was need for the government to also intensify efforts in improving the security situation in the country, so that farmers could redouble efforts in food production.\n\n\u201dWe thank the President for giving agriculture an atmosphere to grow, but we need the government to protect the lives of the citizens, because it is only when there is life that we talk of food,\u201d she appealed.\n\nMr Peter Dama, National Chairman, Rice Millers Association of Nigeria said a lot of factors needed to be in place, to achieve a country desired by all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dThe issue of insecurity, importation of food items grown in the countries, should be stopped. Nigerians have the responsibility of safeguarding the investments and economy of this nation for our progress.\n\n\u201dWe also enjoin Nigerians with useful information on rice smugglers, to always reach out to security agencies, so that these economic saboteurs are apprehended, for the progress of our country,\u201d Dama stated.

We are going to miss his love and warm as a grandfather, father, brother, uncle and supporter,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph said that the family was trying to cope with the shocked of the general\u2019s demise and would discuss the funeral arrangements soon.\n\nHe described his father as \u201ca General who was so faithful and loyal to the nation, Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a general who had no bias mind as a detribalised Nigerian. He served this nation faithful and identified with all Nigerians and Africa as a continent.\n\n\u201cWe and Nigerians are going to miss him having served humanity in this country and Africa as a whole, \u201d Joseph said.\n\nAccording to him, the corpse of the general has since been deposited at the JUTH mortuary.\n\nLate retired Lt. Gen. Dogonyaro, a soldier and an administrator, was born on Sept. 12, 1940 in Vom, Plateau State, though a native of Taroh in Langtang North Local Government Area.\n\nDogonyaro had his early education at Boys\u2019 Secondary School, Gindiri, and thereafter was enlisted in the Nigerian Army, 1964.\n\nHe was commissioned Second-Lieutenant in the Nigerian Army Armoured Corps, 1967; Officer Commanding, 1 Recce Squadron, NA, 1967-69; Quartermaster General, I Infantry Division (Main), N, 1969-70.\n\nThe late general became Chief Instructor and Adjutant, Rece Training School, NA, 1970 to 1972; Commandirg Officer, I Recce Regiment, NA., 1972 to 1976.\n\nHe was appointed Principal Staff Officer, Headquarters, Nigerian Army Armoured Corp, 1976 to 1977; Commanding Officer, 24 Armoured Brigade, NA., 1977-79.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, he was made the Task Force Commanding Officer, 203 Armoured Battalion on the Peace-keeping Force in Chad; Director of Manning (Army), Army Headquarters, \u2018A\u2019 Branch, N.A and Director of Armoury, 1985.\n\nHe was also the General Officer Commanding 3 Armoured Division, N.A, Jos, 1985 to 1987; mm: Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC), 1985; General Officer Commanding 2nd Mechanised Division, N.A, Ibadan, 1987; promoted Major-General, 1988; Promoted Lt.

          "text": "By Bukola Adewumi\n\nSome stakeholders in the agriculture sector have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intensify efforts in curbing banditry, kidnapping and terrorism, as these can threaten food security.\n\nThe stakeholders made the appeal in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja.\n\nThey noted that the recent increase in kidnapping and banditry had made a lot of farmers run from their farmlands in search of safe hideouts.\n\nMr Paul Ikonne, Executive Secretary, National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) said there was need to urgently address the insecurity challenges in the country in order to overcome the challenges of food shortage.\n\nIkonne noted that dialogue remained critical in addressing issues of insecurity and herders, adding that a peaceful dialogue between farmers and herders would prevent future clashes.\n\n\u201dI believe that the herders want their cattle to be healthy so they can sell and make a profit. What this means is that they also want a conducive environment to do their business.\n\n\u201dSo, NALDA is going to engage them and the communities; we will create an avenue where they can feed their cattle so that we all can live in peace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National President, Maize Association of Nigeria, Dr. Bello Abubakar said maize farmers in the country were currently producing enough to meet the demand for maize in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar however stated that more needed to be done to sustain the achievement, noting that one of such was to provide a good environment for farmers to work.\n\nHe said that in order to achieve the desired environment, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism must stop.\n\n\u201dOur farmers can not go to their farms because of fear of being kidnapped, robbed and killed,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to sustain the ban on maize importation so as to further boost its production and encourage farmers.\n\nHajia Salamatu Garba, Executive Director, Women Farmers Advancement Network said despite the current issue of insecurity, farmers across the country had been toiling hard to ensure availability of food on every Nigerian table.\n\nGarba said there was need for the government to also intensify efforts in improving the security situation in the country so that farmers could redouble efforts in food production.\n\n\u201dWe thank the President for giving agriculture an atmosphere to grow, but we need the government to protect the lives of the citizens because it is only when there is the life that we talk of food,\u201d she appealed.\n\nMr Peter Dama, National Chairman, Rice Millers Association of Nigeria said a lot of factors needed to be in place, to achieve a country desired by all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dThe issue of insecurity, importation of food items grown in the countries, should be stopped. Nigerians have the responsibility of safeguarding the investments and economy of this nation for our progress.\n\n\u201dWe also enjoin Nigerians with useful information on rice smugglers, to always reach out to security agencies, so that these economic saboteurs are apprehended, for the progress of our country,\u201d Dama stated.",

          "text": "Agency Report\n\nBitcoin slid to a 2-1/2-month low on Thursday after a regulatory probe into crypto exchange Binance added to pressure from Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) chief Elon Musk\u2019s reversing his stance on accepting the digital currency.\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that as part of the Binance inquiry, the U.S. Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service have sought information from individuals with insight into its business.\n\nBitcoin dropped to $45,700, the lowest since March 1, then steadied at $49,312 in Asia morning trade on Friday.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell 17% on Wednesday following Musk\u2019s remarks that Tesla would stop accepting the digital token as payment for its electric cars for environmental reasons.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental matters are an incredibly sensitive subject right now, and Tesla\u2019s move might serve as a wake-up call to businesses and consumers using bitcoin, who hadn\u2019t hitherto considered its carbon footprint,\u201d Laith Khalaf, an analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\nBitcoin remains about 70% higher for the year and is more than 1,000% higher than its 2020 low of $3,850.\n\nBinance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Binance spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the company doesn\u2019t comment on specific inquiries but takes its legal obligations seriously and engages with regulators in a collaborative fashion.\n\nEthereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped to a session low of $3,543.62 and last changed hands at $3,656, down about 4%. On Wednesday, ethereum hit a record high of $4,380.64.\n\nTesla\u2019s announcement on Feb. 8 that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would accept it as payment for its electric vehicles has been one factor behind the digital currency\u2019s surge this year.\n\nMusk has faced pressure over bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact. The cryptocurrency relies on computers competing to solve elaborate math problems, which use huge amounts of electricity.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\u201d Musk tweeted.\n\nMusk\u2019s comments roiled markets even though he said Tesla would not sell any bitcoin and would resume accepting it as soon as \u201cmining\u201d for it transitioned to more sustainable energy.\n\nIn a second tweet on Thursday, Musk denounced the \u201cinsane\u201d amount of energy used to produce bitcoin, which pushed bitcoin lower.\n\nJeffrey Wang, Vancouver-based head of Americas at Amber Group, a cryptocurrency service provider, said broader selling of risk assets in traditional markets was another factor behind Wednesday\u2019s bitcoin plunge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think everything is selling off just because of this news. This was kind of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back in terms of adding to the risk sell-off,\u201d Wang said.\n\nBitcoin has struggled since hitting a record $64,895.22 in mid-April, dropping to the cusp of $47,000 just 11 days later before hovering around $58,000 since the start of May.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS\n\nAt current rates, bitcoin mining devours about the same amount of energy annually as the Netherlands did in 2019, data from the University of Cambridge and the International Energy Agency showed.\n\nTesla shares were down 2.4%, while the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, tumbled nearly 9% (COIN.O). Smaller cryptocurrencies were less affected by the news.\n\n\u201cThe reason given in the tweet is fossil fuel use for the mining of BTC, but most cryptocurrencies have already found more efficient ways to do that and therefore outperformed.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency dogecoin lost more than a third of its price on Sunday after Musk, whose tweets had stoked demand for the token earlier this year, called it a \u201chustle\u201d on the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedy show.\n\nBy Tuesday, however, he was asking his followers on Twitter if they wanted Tesla to accept dogecoin and it jumped on Friday in Asia after Musk tweeted about it again and said he was working on improvements to its transaction systems.\n\nDogecoin rose 20% to 52 cents on Friday according to Binance and last traded at $0.4825.",

At a certain level, people will be talking, but we only know the beginning of a war, not the end. Nobody will remember how the war in Syria started and it is still on for years. And everything they built is being destroyed. So, I think we have to do it softly. We have started democracy. We are not happy with the way it is going.\n\n\u201cBut even Quran says there will be a time when God will give you good leaders; there will be a time when the leaders that you are given by God are not as good because He wants you people to see the difference. We should assume that this too will pass. It started six years ago. In another two years, it will go.\n\n\u201cIf you are saying because of that you want to go or you don\u2019t want to go, who even tells you that the North is not even getting ready to go? Let us look at it, people in the South are talking too much, and people up North are acting too much.\n\n\u201cIn Yorubaland, we talk too much. The North is also preparing to leave and they are working at it. Do you think it is a mistake that they are constructing a railway to the Niger Republic when we have not built a railway from Ibadan to Kano, not even Abuja, and they said it is the first place we are going to spend our money?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the refinery in Kaduna be repaired? Why are they saying they would build another refinery in Daura (Katsina State)? And they would be bringing crude oil from the Niger Republic to the place. Don\u2019t let us deceive ourselves, maybe a time will come when all of us will sit down together and separate peacefully.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigerian Airlines Blame Dollar Scarcity, Pandemic for Rising Fares",
          "text": "Airlines have attributed the skyrocketing airfares, which have elicited disaffection from travellers to the scarcity of dollars and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe airlines, in separate interviews with THISDAY, warned travellers to brace for a higher fare regime as economic indicators show that the problems are not likely to abate soon.\n\nFrom N28, 000 for a one-hour flight after the high season in December 2020, the average cost of a one-hour ticket has now risen to N60, 000 for a one-way ticket and could rise as high as N120, 000 if a passenger buys a ticket on the day he is travelling.\n\nThe airlines attributed the soaring airfares to dollar scarcity, which has forced them to resort to the parallel market for the greenback.\n\nThey appealed for the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to create special forex window for aviation.\n\nThey also attributed the hike in fare to the fact that many aircraft that were taken out of the country for maintenance were yet to be brought back because of the pandemic, which has hindered activities in some countries.\n\nOwing to this, Nigerian carriers have a limited fleet but high demand for air travel, as insecurity continues to discourage many people from travelling by road.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of Air Peace, Mrs. Toyin Olajide, told THISDAY that airfares are high because of forex scarcity.\n\n\u201cAirfares are high because of forex and we buy dollars from the parallel market. When you look at the prices of tickets, they don\u2019t reflect the actual cost of operation. If they do, they will be higher than what we sell tickets now, but competition has kept the fares relatively low.\n\n\u201cWe need dollars for most of the things we do in aviation. We buy spares in dollars and we source dollar at N500 per dollar. Just imagine the cost if you want to import an aircraft engine. So the high cost of fares is because of forex,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe added that currently, there is limited capacity because airlines are operating fewer aircraft in their fleet.\n\nAccording to her, Air Peace has most of its aircraft overseas where they were ferried for maintenance but they got stuck because of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\n\nShe said most maintenance facilities overseas engaged in skeletal operations due to the lockdown, which delayed the completion of the maintenance of many aircraft to enable them to return to Nigeria for service.\n\n\u201cOur aircraft that were ferried for maintenance overseas have not returned due to the lockdown. The maintenance facilities cannot meet delivery time. Few people are allowed to work on the aircraft and because of the lockdown, so many things are not working the way they should.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have some of the aircraft in Israel, if you order spares from another country, it takes time before it will be delivered because immigration services may not be working in some countries; some companies may not even be operating optimally. So these are some of the challenges that we have,\u201d Olajide said.\n\nShe stated that about 21 of Air Peace aircraft are under maintenance or due for maintenance, adding that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) calculates aircraft maintenance date by calendar months, so anyone that operated for 18 months is grounded and readied for maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe have 21 aeroplanes that are under maintenance or due for maintenance but we have not got a slot for those due for maintenance in facilities overseas. They have to push out the ones that have completed their checks before they will take in more. So the aircraft have to queue and wait,\u201d she said.\n\nOlajide, however, said the good news was that the brand new Air Peace aircraft, Embraer E195-E2 would soon start operation, as NCAA is about to complete its certification on them.\n\n\u201cWe already have two of the aircraft in Nigeria and three are due to arrive this May. NCAA is at the stage of the demonstration flight, which will take about one week. So we will have five of the new aircraft operating from this month. But for the other aircraft, what is affecting us is the maintenance calendar and the fact that those aircraft taken for maintenance are yet to return,\u201d she added.\n\nA former CEO of Aero Contractors, Captain Ado Sanusi, also told THISDAY that high demand triggered the increase in airfares.\n\n\u201cAlso there is no capacity. For example, Azman Air that was grounded by NCAA has three aircraft. That number is off from the system until they resume operations. Airlines are also taking advantage of the demand because I cannot understand why an economy ticket was selling for N74, 000 from Abuja to Kano, one way, which is less than one hour flight. There is a lot of demand for air travel because of security challenges on the roads; airlines are taking advantage of that,\u201d Sanusi said.\n\nBut the Managing Director of Aero Contractors, Captain Mahmoud Abdullahi, told THISDAY that high fares are caused by scarcity of foreign exchange so airlines are finding it difficult to access dollars so they buy from the parallel market.\n\n\u201cAirlines are finding it difficult to source dollars, so they are buying it from the bureau de change. If we are getting it from CBN, it will be better. Then there is this issue with aviation fuel, in which prices change every day. It keeps on going up. For airlines, everything is dominated by dollars. CBN should give airlines a special window to access forex. The fares are increasing but there is a limit to what the passengers can afford,\u201d Abdullahi stated.\n\nThe General Manager, Public Affairs, NCAA, Mr. Sam Adurogboye, however, said the maintenance calendar of 18 months for C-check couldn\u2019t be changed because that is what is in the regulation, so it is the law.\n\nBut he said if the airlines wanted to review it, they should submit a proposal to the regulation committee to consider.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do is based on the law. We have standing regulation that is followed to do these things. We also have a standing regulation committee. So airlines under Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) or as individuals can submit a proposal, requesting for the review of that regulation. But for now, we have to follow the law as it is and it stipulates 18 months for C-check and we cannot change that,\u201d he explained.\n\nChinedu Eze",
          "summary": "Airlines have attributed the skyrocketing airfares, which have elicited disaffection from travellers to the scarcity of dollars and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe airlines attributed the soaring airfares to dollar scarcity, which has forced them to resort to the parallel market for the greenback.\nThe Chief Operating Officer of Air Peace, Mrs. Toyin Olajide, told THISDAY that airfares are high because of forex scarcity.\nShe added that currently, there is limited capacity because airlines are operating fewer aircraft in their fleet.\nSo airlines under Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) or as individuals can submit a proposal, requesting for the review of that regulation.",
