          "title": "Baby\u2019s first stool can help predict risk of developing asthma later in life, says study",
          "text": "It may seem like an unusual place to go looking for answers, but the contents of a baby\u2019s first diaper can reveal a lot about a newborn\u2019s future health.\n\nIn a new study published in Cell Reports Medicine, a team of University of British Columbia researchers says that the composition of a baby\u2019s first poop \u2014 a thick, dark green substance known as meconium \u2014 is associated with whether or not a child will develop allergies within their first year of life; with the observation that children with allergies are at the highest risk of also developing asthma.\n\nCell Reports Medicine is a cutting-edge open access research in translational and clinical biomedical sciences that inform and influence human health and medicine.\n\nSpeaking about the study, senior co-author Dr. Brett Finlay, a professor at the Michael Smith Laboratories at UBC, says, \u201cOur analysis revealed that newborns who developed allergic sensitisation by one year of age had significantly less \u2018rich\u2019 meconium at birth, compared to those who didn\u2019t develop allergic sensitisation.\u201d\n\nMeconium, which is typically passed within the first day of life, is made up of a variety of materials ingested and excreted during development, ranging from skin cells, amniotic fluid and various molecules known as metabolites.\n\n\u201cMeconium is like a time capsule, revealing what the infant was exposed to before it was born.\n\n\u201cIt contains all sorts of molecules encountered and accumulated from the mother while in the womb, and it then becomes the initial food source for the earliest gut microbes,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Charisse Petersen, a research associate in UBC\u2019s department of paediatrics.\n\nAs part of the study, the researchers analysed meconium samples from 100 infants enrolled in the CHILD Cohort Study, a world-leading birth cohort study in maternal, newborn and child health research.\n\nThey discovered that the fewer different types of molecules a baby\u2019s meconium contained, the greater the child\u2019s risk of developing allergies by one year.\n\nThey also found that a reduction in certain molecules was associated with changes to key bacterial groups. These bacteria groups play a critical role in the development and maturation of a vast ecosystem of gut microbes, known as the microbiota, which is a powerful player in health and disease.\n\n\u201cThis work shows that the development of a healthy immune system and microbiota may actually start well before a child is born \u2014 and signals that the tiny molecules an infant is exposed to in the womb play a fundamental role in future health,\u201d says Dr. Petersen.\n\nUsing a machine-learning algorithm, the researchers combined meconium, microbe and clinical data to predict with a high degree of accuracy (76 per cent), and more reliably than ever before, whether or not an infant would develop allergies by one year of age.\n\nThe study findings have important implications for at-risk infants, say the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe know that children with allergies are at the highest risk of also developing asthma. Now, we have an opportunity to identify at-risk infants who could benefit from early interventions before they even begin to show signs and symptoms of allergies or asthma later in life,\u201d says the study\u2019s senior co-author Dr. Stuart Turvey, a professor in UBC\u2019s department of paediatrics.",

For example, almost 54 Million people have obtained their NIN and this can translate to up to 190 Million mobile numbers, since empirical evidence suggests that each unique NIN maps to 3 to 4 phone lines. The much awaited Android enrolment system is now ready for deployment and this has the potential to significantly accelerate the speed and ease of enrolments.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the telecom providers and other enrolment agents have also opened several centres across the country to make it easier for eligible citizens and residents to obtain and link their NINs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has approved the extension as part of its effort to make it easier for its citizens and residents to obtain the NIN and it is important to take advantage of the extension. Dr Pantami wishes to thank Nigerians for their patience and compliance with the Federal Government\u2019s directive on the NIN-SIM registration exercise. He again reiterated government\u2019s commitment to continually taking decisions aimed at easing the pains of the citizens with regard to issues related to NIN and SIM registration.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State. This influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat; our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the government had taken steps to ensure that the threat did not turn into an attack, adding that \u201cprofiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs, will be done in order to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nThe SSG assured the people that the state government would ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies would be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\nHe added that the people were not camped in a particular area but moving around the four LGAs and were harboured by residents of the communities, saying that security agencies would fish them out.\n\nThe government also said that five of the bandits who reportedly destroyed the MTN mast in Gamawa LGA in their bid to facilitate their nefarious activities had been arrested.\n\n\u201cSome bandits have been arrested for vandalising the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for an attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Security Council Reconvenes Today\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe council, which had met last Friday, could not conclude deliberations on the security position of the nation and had to adjourn till today to come with a holistic position on the security crisis.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting will hold at the Conference Hall of the First Lady by 10 am with Buhari presiding as usual.\n\nThose expected to attend the meeting include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\n\nOthers are: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Ishiaka Oladayo Amoo and the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A policeman, for no reason, opened fire on Godwin Udoh\u00b4s innocent family, changing their lives forever\n\n\n\nMy family and I were returning home from church, when we encountered some policemen. It was nighttime, and the headlights of our Keke (tricycle motor) illuminated the officers, making them visible. They seemed to be discussing something.\n\nGodwin Udoh\n\nAs we drove nearer, one of them brought out a gun and tried to hit me with it. Alarmed, I parked the Keke and went over to meet them, just to make sure everything was okay. My wife followed. Neither I nor any member of my family have ever had problems with the police, so we did not have anything to fear or hide.\n\nThe police men started to ask us questions. Then, one of them demanded a 2000 naira bribe. I told them I did not have 2000 naira on me. I was on my way home from church - not work. And I was with my family - as they could see by the presence of my wife by me and my children in the Keke.\n\nOne of the officers, upon recognizing that my story checked out - that I was indeed innocently in the company of my family - asked me to go.\n\nIn the process of getting back into the Keke, however, I suddenly heard gunshots. It came from behind me, where we had met the officers.\n\nIn that split second, I discovered my jaw had burst open. I had been shot.\n\nFile Photo\n\nConfused and in severe pain, I instinctively held my jaw and mouth together to prevent the loss of my blood, which was by that time gushing out like a pipe faucet forced open.\n\nThen, I heard shouts of \u00b4Mummy is dying! Mummy is dying!\u00b4\n\nMy wife had been shot too, and she was bleeding even more seriously than I was, especially from her head.\n\nShe had sat back into our Keke and had been holding our baby when a bullet ripped through the back of the vehicle, ramming into her head and causing her to slump over the crying baby, who my daughter later picked up.\n\nLATE COMFORT IDONGESIT UDOH\n\nI later found out that the policeman who opened fire on us, unprovoked, was the same one who had earlier tried to hit me with a gun. I have still not understood why he fired so heartlessly at an unarmed family, when his colleague had asked us to drive on.\n\nWith my wife in a pool of blood, and my children wailing, I swallowed my own pain and tried to save my family by calling out for help. None of the cars passing by stopped to come to our aid, as they claimed they didn't want to be involved with anything concerning the infamously brutal police.\n\nOne good and brave samaritan however, eventually stopped and had mercy on us. He was a bus driver, and with the help of another kind lady who was around, they helped carry us to the hospital.\n\nWe were unsuccessful with getting treatment at two hospitals, before finally ending up at Ikorodu General Hospital. There, we were asked to submit a police report before receiving medical attention.\n\nWe went to the Idimu Area Command to get a report, but we were told to go back to the hospital because our case was an emergency which did not require a report.\n\nWe told the police that we had already told the hospital staff - and indeed they (the hospital staff) themselves could see that we were an emergency case - yet they still insisted on us producing a report before they would treat us.\n\nWe went back to Ikorodu General Hospital with the instructions the Idimu Area M Command had given us, but the hospital staff were still adamant: no police report, no treatment.\n\nThe driver of the bus had to go back to the Area Command to try again for a police report. Fortunately, and finally, he was able to obtain one. The staff of Ikorodu Hospital had begun first aid treatment on us by the time the driver returned with the report.\n\nWe were later referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), but just when we were about to set off, more problems arose: Our good samaritan found out that his bus had run out of fuel. We decided to go back to the Area Command so they could help us with a vehicle to transport us to LUTH.\n\nWhen we got to the Area Command, we met some top police officials who had just arrived there. They told us that they were coming from the Isheri Police Station, where the officers who had attacked us earlier were based. The police chiefs assured us that the officers had been arrested, and that the matter would be handled with the justice it deserved.\n\nThey then released a vehicle to convey us to LUTH. With the help of the officers, and CSO there, we were given urgent attention, with the police paying the bills our treatment.\n\nWhile my jaw and right hand sustained damage that still gives me issues today, my wife however couldn't live to tell her story.\n\nI really wish she had sustained only injuries like I had, but it wasn to be. This innocent, loving woman was a mother to my children and I, and now she is no more - for reasons no one can still explain.\n\nLosing the wife of my youth has been akin to losing my very life. I feel lost. I am not okay. I am in pain, physically and emotionally, and my children are out of school too.\n\nMy life has been turned upside down, and I have barely had help coming through for me. I am calling on all Nigerians, especially our President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, to come to my aid.\n\nI pray people have compassion on my family, at least for the sake of my children, because I do not want this cruel tragedy to rob them of a good education. I do not want their future ruined because of this.\n\nThey will share these exclusive stories directly to your inbox as well as on their website.\n\n\n\nTo subscribe so you get the stories, click this link \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00be https://t.co/RdKLhH8BQw \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0088\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00be @tigereyefound\n\n\n\nTogether, we will end police brutality.\n\n[2/2] \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) April 20, 2021\n\n_______\n\nThis story is part of a multimedia project by Tiger Eye Foundation and media partners across Nigeria, documenting police brutality in Nigeria, and advocating for police reform.",

          "text": "A policeman, for no reason, opened fire on Godwin Udoh\u00b4s innocent family, changing their lives forever\n\n\n\nMy family and I were returning home from church, when we encountered some policemen. It was nighttime, and the headlights of our Keke (tricycle motor) illuminated the officers, making them visible. They seemed to be discussing something.\n\nGodwin Udoh\n\nAs we drove nearer, one of them brought out a gun and tried to hit me with it. Alarmed, I parked the Keke and went over to meet them, just to make sure everything was okay. My wife followed. Neither I nor any member of my family have ever had problems with the police, so we did not have anything to fear or hide.\n\nThe police men started to ask us questions. Then, one of them demanded a 2000 naira bribe. I told them I did not have 2000 naira on me. I was on my way home from church - not work. And I was with my family - as they could see by the presence of my wife by me and my children in the Keke.\n\nOne of the officers, upon recognizing that my story checked out - that I was indeed innocently in the company of my family - asked me to go.\n\nIn the process of getting back into the Keke, however, I suddenly heard gunshots. It came from behind me, where we had met the officers.\n\nIn that split second, I discovered my jaw had burst open. I had been shot.\n\nFile Photo\n\nConfused and in severe pain, I instinctively held my jaw and mouth together to prevent the loss of my blood, which was by that time gushing out like a pipe faucet forced open.\n\nThen, I heard shouts of \u00b4Mummy is dying! Mummy is dying!\u00b4\n\nMy wife had been shot too, and she was bleeding even more seriously than I was, especially from her head.\n\nShe had sat back into our Keke and had been holding our baby when a bullet ripped through the back of the vehicle, ramming into her head and causing her to slump over the crying baby, who my daughter later picked up.\n\nLATE COMFORT IDONGESIT UDOH\n\nI later found out that the policeman who opened fire on us, unprovoked, was the same one who had earlier tried to hit me with a gun. I have still not understood why he fired so heartlessly at an unarmed family, when his colleague had asked us to drive on.\n\nWith my wife in a pool of blood, and my children wailing, I swallowed my own pain and tried to save my family by calling out for help. None of the cars passing by stopped to come to our aid, as they claimed they didn't want to be involved with anything concerning the infamously brutal police.\n\nOne good and brave samaritan however, eventually stopped and had mercy on us. He was a bus driver, and with the help of another kind lady who was around, they helped carry us to the hospital.\n\nWe were unsuccessful with getting treatment at two hospitals, before finally ending up at Ikorodu General Hospital. There, we were asked to submit a police report before receiving medical attention.\n\nWe went to the Idimu Area Command to get a report, but we were told to go back to the hospital because our case was an emergency which did not require a report.\n\nWe told the police that we had already told the hospital staff - and indeed they (the hospital staff) themselves could see that we were an emergency case - yet they still insisted on us producing a report before they would treat us.\n\nWe went back to Ikorodu General Hospital with the instructions the Idimu Area M Command had given us, but the hospital staff were still adamant: no police report, no treatment.\n\nThe driver of the bus had to go back to the Area Command to try again for a police report. Fortunately, and finally, he was able to obtain one. The staff of Ikorodu Hospital had begun first aid treatment on us by the time the driver returned with the report.\n\nWe were later referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), but just when we were about to set off, more problems arose: Our good samaritan found out that his bus had run out of fuel. We decided to go back to the Area Command so they could help us with a vehicle to transport us to LUTH.\n\nWhen we got to the Area Command, we met some top police officials who had just arrived there. They told us that they were coming from the Isheri Police Station, where the officers who had attacked us earlier were based. The police chiefs assured us that the officers had been arrested, and that the matter would be handled with the justice it deserved.\n\nThey then released a vehicle to convey us to LUTH. With the help of the officers, and CSO there, we were given urgent attention, with the police paying the bills our treatment.\n\nWhile my jaw and right hand sustained damage that still gives me issues today, my wife however couldn't live to tell her story.\n\nI really wish she had sustained only injuries like I had, but it wasn to be. This innocent, loving woman was a mother to my children and I, and now she is no more - for reasons no one can still explain.\n\nLosing the wife of my youth has been akin to losing my very life. I feel lost. I am not okay. I am in pain, physically and emotionally, and my children are out of school too.\n\nMy life has been turned upside down, and I have barely had help coming through for me. I am calling on all Nigerians, especially our President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, to come to my aid.\n\nI pray people have compassion on my family, at least for the sake of my children, because I do not want this cruel tragedy to rob them of a good education. I do not want their future ruined because of this.\n\nThey will share these exclusive stories directly to your inbox as well as on their website.\n\n\n\nTo subscribe so you get the stories, click this link \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00be https://t.co/RdKLhH8BQw \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0088\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00be @tigereyefound\n\n\n\nTogether, we will end police brutality.\n\n[2/2] \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) April 20, 2021\n\n_______\n\nThis story is part of a multimedia project by Tiger Eye Foundation and media partners across Nigeria, documenting police brutality in Nigeria, and advocating for police reform.",

          "title": "Designing and building sustainable commercial spaces in Nigeria",
          "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of how products and companies are built in Africa. A new Centre Stage story drops every Monday at 3 PM.\n\nAs workplaces continue to re-open, many organizations are adopting the hybrid work model \u2013 a new working style that combines work remotely and from the office.\n\nThe hybrid work model is perfect for most businesses, especially those with heavy dependence on their operations and customer service teams.\n\nKobo360 is an example of a company with a robust operational and customer service team. The logistics startup helps cargo owners request and schedule trucks to pick up and deliver their goods to specified destinations.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to manage a call centre via Zoom and Meet. Kobo360 needed a new office that was uniquely designed to fit their business operations needs.\n\nTheir office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts. Innovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nYinka meets Kobo360\u2019s co-founders\n\nSo, what goes into planning and setting up a meeting with the founders of a YC-backed startup?\n\nThe first time I met with them was at the end of 2019. During our first meeting, we discussed what they needed in the space and what they were looking for in terms of design and style. And meeting them was a really great experience. Sometimes because of the scale of projects we work on, a lot of our clientele are usually older people. So it was really exciting to work with younger people. They are really brilliant guys.\n\nWas designing the office just a job for you?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. I enjoyed working with them. They understood everything I was saying and we were on the same wavelength. They encouraged and allowed us to be as creative as possible. It was like a match made in heaven for me.\u201d\n\nDealing with tight deadlines and the 2020 pandemic:\n\nWhen you met them, had the company been accepted into YC?\n\n\u201cYes, they had. I first met them at the tail-end of 2018 and the following year, we pretty much came to an agreement about the work that needed to be done, amongst other things.\u201d\n\nDid you know? When Obi Ozor was asked what was getting in the way of Kobo360 becoming a unicorn (a company valued at $1bn or more), Ozor responded with, \u201cWorking capital.\u201d\n\nWhen did work officially start at the site?\n\n[laughs] They gave my team and I a really tight deadline so work pretty much began about two months after I met them. We had a month to design a concept, negotiate and all that; after the ink dried they wanted us on the job ASAP.\n\nWow. That was a really close first start. When was the project completed?\n\nIt was in different phases actually \u2013 the first phase was completed in the middle of 2020 and the second at the end of 2020.\n\nHow did the pandemic affect the work you did for kobo360?\n\nThe pandemic impacted our work in major ways. First, it affected the way we phased and spread out the work. Usually, when we carry out commercial projects, we like to work in four or five phases. It also affected our on-site procedures. We had to regulate working hours and the number of bodies we needed at the site. Proper planning and scheduling became even more important to accomplish our project goals.\n\nKobo360\u2019s office design process\n\nCan you say more about the decision to work in phases and what that looked like for the kobo360 project?\n\nOkay, the first phase I think was the operations floor, and then the call centre. We phase our projects out for several reasons. One reason is financial. We try to ease our client\u2019s financial burdens in terms of commitments. We also consider Kobo360\u2019s operational team. They needed a space to transition into after the lockdown eased in Nigeria. Like I said, we had a really really tight deadline. We pretty much wrapped up the first phase in about a month or two. Wrapping up the first phase quickly allowed us to complete the other portions of the project in good time.\n\nYou mentioned that the founders cared about creativity. Can you tell me about how you accessed the creative side of your mind to specifically do this project.\n\nWe usually try to make all our projects as tailored to the client as much as possible. And we kept that same energy with Kobo360. They are a logistics company which means they pretty much empower freight trucks across Africa.\n\nKeeping their mission in mind, we visualized the expressways and highways freight trucks drive on and utilized them as inspiration for the design of the spine that connects the different functional spaces on the floor. Elements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\n\nWe wanted the space to be a physical representation of what the company actually does in the ecosystem.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nHow did you and your team visualize what Kobo360\u2019s office would look like?\n\nIt was an iterative process. We watched a few videos about Kobo360 as our own way of trying to get inside the soul of the company. Our research into the company, outside of my conversations with the co-founders, informed our design process. Once we finally got to a place that we were comfortable with, we created 3D renderings and video walkthroughs and presented them to Kobo3060. There were a few back and forth feedback sessions \u2013 which are to be expected \u2013 but we wanted to satisfy our clients.\n\nSource: Innovate Concepts LTD.\n\nTell me something about design that most people don\u2019t know?\n\nDesign must be organic.\n\nOrganic? Say more\u2026\n\nSo, I remember being in school and whenever I heard constructive criticism about my design I got upset because I wanted to have my own way. But later I realised that to be a successful architect, you have to be willing to get other people\u2019s perspectives. So design being organic means it being able to bend and make room for stakeholders in the process.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Kobo360\u2019s office. What areas in the space required special attention?\n\nThe part of the building that houses Kobo360\u2019s call centre required special attention. You know there\u2019s a lot of conversation and noise that happens in call centres. So in designing that space, we made it secluded from the general floor and also used a lot of sound-absorbing materials\u2013 like acoustic ceilings. Sound absorbent materials reduce noise and make an office a more conducive environment for employees to function in.\n\nInterior shoot of Kobo360 Office at Costain Lagos.\n\nSustainability, Nigeria\u2019s architectural industry and Yinka\u2019s early years\n\nHow should Nigeria approach innovation in your industry?\n\nIn Nigeria we typically don\u2019t pay attention to being sustainable and eco-friendly. We prioritize costs and getting the work done quickly. Getting work done quickly is good, but Nigerian architects need to start designing with sustainability in mind. When we scope a building, we construct pathways for natural ventilation and daylight. We also prioritize using local materials over processed ones. This way of thinking seems expensive but in the long term, you actually save more money on energy.\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nWith Kobo360, we used a lot of daylighting in the space. So again, during the day they hardly actually put on any of the artificial lights because there\u2019s a lot of natural light coming in through the large windows placed around the office.\n\nWhy architecture? What inspired you to go down this path?\n\nWhy did I want to study architecture? it\u2019s just something that you know has always been a passion. Funny enough, I was actually inspired by my father. He\u2019s also an architect, so I guess that\u2019s who planted the seed. But yeah I mean I tried it in university and loved it and I\u2019ve never looked back. Architecture is what I have always wanted to do.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria. Yinka moved back home to make a difference in the architectural industry; and he\u2019s doing so by guiding Innovate Concepts, into the future of eco-friendly and culturally relevant design.",

          "text": "Accelerators target a kind of company: a few months or a couple years old; ambitious; raw. Probably founded by people who have never built a fast-growing company from scratch, but have managerial or product-building experience.\n\nSome organisations set themselves up as places where teachable builders come to find ideas. But your typical accelerator works with founders who have a useful, usable and desirable product. Or at least a product that excites.\n\n(I use \u201caccelerators\u201d as the family name for these organisations. There are some differences, as Justin Norman shows in this piece from August last year.)\n\nWhat\u2019s in the lab?\n\nY Combinator sets out to help founders make something people want. Michael Seibel, the firm\u2019s MD for Early Stage told me YC doesn\u2019t claim to be experts with answers.\n\nInstead, YC is a set of resources: an alumni network, a set of advice, a set of accountability practices, and access to more investors. It\u2019s up to founders to use these as best fits their business.\n\n[ Read: Y Combinator\u2019s MD wants to visit Nigeria and Egypt soon. What will he learn? ]\n\nYC critics always point out that the firm has no Africa partners. It limits the local context they can apply in advising and keeping startups accountable. So do accelerators with boots in Africa have an advantage to exploit?\n\nFounders Factory Africa claims it is becoming \u201cthe go-to innovation partner for startups, investors, governments, and corporates\u201d in Africa and beyond. It was founded in 2018, is based in South Africa and offers separate programs for startups at build and scale stages.\n\nLike YC, Startupbootcamp Afritech is a 3-month program. But unlike YC, they are not shy about their \u201cexpert-led sessions\u201d and \u201cexclusive opportunities to take part in leading Commerce conferences.\u201d\n\nSo if you put the accelerator\u2019s pitch in three buckets, it would be money, market mentorship and management advisory.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing?\n\nWhen I asked an African government advisor his thoughts on what holds startups back, he responded with two acronyms: VUCA and BYOE.\n\nVolatility. Uncertainty. Complexity.

          "title": "ANALYSIS: New Policy Fails To Reverse Gas Flaring, Importation",
          "text": "May 3, 2021 439\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.",
