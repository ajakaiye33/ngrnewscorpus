          "summary": "The e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock.\nUnder the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature.\nThe e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it.\nYou can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.",
