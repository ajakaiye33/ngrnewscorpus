Camillus Ejike Mbaka of the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria violently broke into the diocesan cathedral church and desecrated the holy alter of sacrifice.\n\n\u201cOver and above this, they brutally vandalised the diocesan bishop\u2019s residence, the cathedral parish house and the secretariat building complex.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I hereby declare and call for a one week union of prayer in reparation and atonement for this heinous act against our central place of worship and the sanctity of the church.\n\n\u201cThe prayer begins from Friday 7th May to Friday 14th May 2021. Every parish, chaplaincy and religious community in the diocese is obliged to participate in this holy activity.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the traditional May devotion prayers (like daily benediction), the following prayers are to be offered for this purpose:\n\n\u201c(a) Five decades of the Holy Rosary, (b) Act of reparation in the Most Blessed Sacrament, (c) Psalms 51 and 23.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you to remain sober and keep the diocese in prayer. With divine assistance and grace, we shall overcome this challenging moment. May Our Lady, the Queen of May intercede for us. Amen.\u201d\n\nMbaka had explained why some unruly youths attacked Bishop Onaga\u2019s residence the protest over his disappearance.\n\nAddressing his followers on Wednesday, the cleric said: \u201cI thank God you have never attacked the wrong people. The DSS (Department of State Services) was not involved in what happened.\n\n\u201cBut the Bishop gave an order that I should not come here (Adoration ground) from today (Wednesday); I should leave adoration house, parish house, that there will be no programme here for 30 days and I should stay silent for 30 days. So, I am telling you the truth about what happened.\n\n\u201cWhen Bishop asked me to go and take you people back to Adoration, I asked him what happened now because you told me that I am going to stay away and silent for 30 days?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThen, he said I should go first and tell you people to go because things are getting worse.\n\n\u201cThis is why people should understand how God works. I never disobeyed the church. People are busy misquoting me doing everything to close this ministry but by the grace of God they cannot do anything.\u201d\n\nMbaka said Onaga summoned him over his recent comments concerning the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu and his connection to the presidency.",

The alleged movement of the bandits caused a stir in the FCT forcing many schools in Bwari to be hurriedly shutdown, with messages sent to parents to pick up their wards from hostels in the area.\n\nA private university owned by the Catholic Church, Veritas, and a polytechnic located close to Bwari have all shutdown and students ordered to go home.\n\nActing Secretary of Education for the FCT, Leramoh Abdulrazaq, assured that security measures have been put in place to ensure the safety of schools.\n\n\u201cThe police, Department of State Security, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, air force, and even the army, as we speak, are in schools that are in session to ensure adequate security,\u201d he said.\n\nBut residents of the attack prone communities appear not to take Abdulrazaq assurances seriously as it was learnt that some parents in the area have refused to send their children to school, pending when security situation would improve.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that residents are taking extra steps to boost their personal security. The source also said additional security had been deployed to key government institutions, like the National Assembly, while police and other security agencies have been mobilise to provide security in major entry and exit points into the FCT.\n\n\u201cAs soon the news went viral, the Federal Government and the FCT Administration immediately ensured that security agents were deployed. In the coming days, residents will see more movement of security agents. There will be stop and search operation too. Bwari which has become a major flashpoint for kidnappers and bandits in FCT will be thoroughly policed. The government can\u2019t wait and allow terrorists to overrun Abuja.

Attijariwafa Bank Managing Director Ismail Douiri and a representative for Access Bank declined to comment.\n\nA deal could bring down the curtain on Atlas Mara\u2019s African foray after Diamond, a former Barclays Plc chief executive officer, misjudged competition on the continent and overpaid for acquisitions. The company said recently that it\u2019s secured regulatory approval for the sales of its businesses in Botswana and Mozambique and received interest in other assets, without elaborating.\n\nAtlas Mara also said it completed a planned restructuring process and extended a standstill agreement with its creditors to May 17 to complete the necessary documentation. It\u2019s still in legal disputes with two creditors, TLG and Norsad, it added.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the need to reposition the company, which has seen a plunge of about 96% in its stock since it started trading toward the end of 2013. The firm\u2019s stake in UBN, Nigeria\u2019s sixth-biggest bank by market value is its largest investment and seen as a foothold into the continent\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Frontier and Sub-saharan Africa Banks\u2019 Analyst, Renaissance Capital, Adesoji Solanke, wrote in a note made available to THISDAY yesterday: \u201cGood for Atlas Mara if they\u2019re able to exit successfully, as they\u2019ve been selling a bunch of assets over the past year, to KCB and Access Bank respectively across different markets. Whether they get a good valuation for Union Bank is another thing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a transformational deal for Access or Zenith (Return-on-Equity dilutive for both), but could be a good way for the Middle Eastern banks to get a decent foothold in the market. We suspect getting the other private equity investor block to sell will be critical as we wouldn\u2019t expect a strategic bank investor to desire a minority shareholding.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist on implementation of full financial autonomy for judiciary, legislature\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThere seems to be no end in sight for the industrial action by the judiciary and legislative workers pressing for the full implementation of financial autonomy for the two arms of government in states as they have vowed not to compromise on their demands for the implementation of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThe workers, who have been on strike for about one month, said yesterday at a meeting with a federal government team, led by Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that the issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries was the constitutional provision that did not warrant any negotiation with governors.\n\nThe national leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) also insisted that the governors must fully implement financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation as guaranteed by the constitution before the current strike will be called off.\n\nBut the federal government pleaded with the unions to consider the efforts being made to resolve the dispute and suspend their strike to enable courts and legislative houses to reopen.\n\nNgige said yesterday in Abuja that progress had been made on about 90 per cent of the issues in dispute.\n\nHowever, the meeting between the federal government team and the leadership of the unions ended last night with an agreement that the unions should go and study the government\u2019s proposal, while the meeting reconvenes next week.\n\nBut earlier, during the opening of talks with the federal government team and representatives of the governors, the Deputy Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Emmanuel Abioye, said the unions still maintained their stance on the full implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislative arms of government in the states.\n\nAbioye, while responding to the minister\u2019s address, said: \u201cI am happy that when you were talking, you said it is a constitutional issue and so since it is a constitutional issue, I don\u2019t think we should negotiate on it. We are trying to avoid someone somewhere coming to challenge the constitution one day. So, anything short of this is not why we are here.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of PASAN, Mr. Mohammed Usman, said the meeting availed them the opportunity to receive the fresh proposals by the governors, adding that the unions resolved to present the proposals to their national executive committees.\n\nHe stated that the unions would be reporting their decisions to the government at another meeting next Tuesday, adding that the strike will continue.\n\nAccording to him, the governors only agreed to shift ground on the issue of ceding money for capital projects to the two arms of government.\n\n\u201cAside from the ceding of capital projects, there is nothing new in the governors\u2019 position. However, we are happy that the federal government has opened negotiations on the matter but we will not suspend the strike until there is agreement on the implementation of full autonomy,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige, however, asked the workers to suspend the strike.\n\nWhile welcoming the parties to the resumed negotiations, the minister said about 90 per cent progress had been achieved in harmonising issues with the governors.\n\nNgige expressed optimism that the strike would soon end.\n\nHe said the government side had made offers to the two unions for them to consult with their various National Executive Committees and revert back.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of work went into the proposal given by the government side to the two unions, which substantially addressed their demands for judicial and legislative autonomy in the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe minister stated that the proposal was produced by the committee of the government side, comprising the Solicitor-General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. Dayo Apata (SAN); the Secretary of the Presidential Committee for the Implementation of Judicial and Legislative Autonomy, Senator Ita Enang; representative of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the Director-General of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF).\n\nNgige said: \u201cA lot of work went in. We have exchanged briefs with the JUSUN and PASAN. They have their demands, which they had earlier submitted. The government side has given counter offers and properly addressed the burning issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe stated that questions were asked and answered, while observations were made and explained, working on the proposal given by the government side.\n\nNgige said the meeting had been adjourned with a view to enable JUSUN and PASAN to take back the government proposal to their members for consideration.\n\n\u201cWe expect them to work on the documents from tomorrow and if they are satisfied, they should inform us. And you know that when they are satisfied, the logical thing is to call off the industrial dispute. So, we are to receive their views on the government offer by Tuesday morning,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige said the discussions were fruitful, adding that they have moved from the initial position of ground zero, to ground 85.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the striking workers to return to work to enable the government to meet the remaining part of their demands.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this when the legislatures are closed in various states. We cannot also operationalise them when the courts are closed and heads of courts are not allowed into the courts or their offices.\n\n\u201cWe have made documentation and statistics for the state Houses of Assembly to make appropriate laws. So, we plead that you open the courts and state Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cBesides, we are menaced by bandits, terrorists and arsonists. With the courts closed, the police cannot tackle insecurity,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Eta Enang, who also spoke at the opening talks with representatives of JUSUN and PASAN, said the suspension of the strike had become necessary to enable the legislatures to pass legislation needed to ensure the smooth implementation of the financial autonomy.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to JUSUN and PASAN that we did not undertake all these efforts in vain and that when we arrive at a certain decision at the end of the technical session, you will be able to hit the ground running. We plead that you call off the strike because we will not be able to pass the necessary laws if the legislative houses remain closed,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, from the engagement so far with the governors, he believed that the gap was being closed.\n\nEnang stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had told the governors to do what was right to the judiciaries and legislatures in their states just as was being done at the federal level.\n\n\u201cThe president is saying to the governors, go and treat the state legislature and judiciary arms the same way we treat the National Assembly and the judiciary at the federal level,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the outcome of the meeting, Abioye said they were going back to meet with their National Executive Committees to study the situation and consider the offers made before reverting back to Ngige.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: NIN Registration Essential for Winning War against Insecurity",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday described National Identification Number (NIN) registration by Nigerians as key to win the ongoing war against insecurity.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Nigerians to fully participate in the ongoing synchronisation of NIN with SIM cards as it will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy.\n\nThe president, at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration at the State House, Abuja said proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database would provide the impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\nHe assured the nation that his administration is fully committed to the safety of Nigerians, adding that linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid national planning and budget preparations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was timely as it would support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies align with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security and anti-corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe digital economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 per cent double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 per cent. This is truly commendable.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the digital economy sector provided online options for activities hitherto restricted to offline channels, while minimising the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors, and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe also said the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe federal government embraced institutionalising online meetings through the approval of the national policy on virtual engagements in federal public institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce, is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the president added.\n\nBuhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past.\n\n\u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Pantami had appreciated the president for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nAccording to him, NIN Registration has recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, with over 12 million of them enrolled within six months.\n\nHe said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that could be used in various transactions, adding that the NIN and SIM card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 per cent of the target audience.\n\nPantami stated that the buoyancy of the telecoms sector has given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world class SIM card manufacturing company sited in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The last may have not been heard about the mega fraud concerning four Oil Mining Leases formerly operated by the Addax Petroleum Nigeria Limited, which are being plotted to be diverted to proxy firms linked to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, and President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Sylva has set up a kangaroo committee of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation headed by Senator Magnus Abe to look into the four leases \u2013 OMLs 123, 124, 126 and 137 \u2013 which were all operated by Addax Petroleum Development Nigeria Limited but which were being plotted to be given to Kaztec Engineering Limited/Salvic Petroleum Resources Limited.\n\nTimipre Sylva\n\nKaztec is owned by Emeka Offor \u2013 a strong ally and crony of Sylva and Daura also.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered on Monday that the minister of state would receive the Magnus Abe report and thereafter recommend to the Nigerian government to implement the recommendations which would favour Emeka Offor and his firm, and sidestep Addax, the original handlers of the OMLs.\n\n\u201cOn May 30, the Federal Government reconstituted the NNPC Board. Emeka Offor nominated Senator Magnus Abe to represent South-South and also he nominated his cousin, Dr Stephen Dike, to represent South-East.

Also, my parents don\u2019t really get good pay where they work so that made me think of what to do in school to support myself and my parents. With what I get from here, I use it to buy textbooks and other things as a student in school,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI started doing this work last month when we started exam. That was when I saw this work. My father was angry at first but I tried to convince him because we really need the money and due to the situation of things at home and he agreed.\n\n\u201cHe, however, told me to stop the work after a while because it\u2019s not too good for my health. I won\u2019t lie, the work is really demanding. Carrying granites, blocks or sand to the third floor of a building under construction is not easy.\u201d\n\nEfemonghe said she had initially kept the development away from her friends but noted that they eventually got to know about it and started mocking her in class.\n\nThe undergraduate said she, however, remains unperturbed by such mockery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw this work, I didn\u2019t tell my friends because I felt they won\u2019t like it or I would be mocked. But one day while I was working, they were passing by and when they saw me, they started laughing at me,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cSo, when I got to school while we were writing exam, they started mocking me, asking me numerous questions inside the class. But I wasn\u2019t bothered by that because they were not the one paying my school fees.\n\n\u201cAt least, it was paying me and I didn\u2019t have to beg others for money. I\u2019m not ashamed of any work that gives me money as far it\u2019s legal and does not go against moral principles.\n\n\u201cI am happy that my co-workers here are supportive. They don\u2019t laugh at me rather they encourage me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEfemonghe said she refused to sleep around with men like some ladies would do to get money so as to protect her dignity.\n\n\u201cI know there are other ways to get money as a woman but I chose this because it\u2019s better. As a girl, if I choose to go around sleeping with men, my parents would not be proud of me and apart from that I would lose my own dignity,\u201d added.\n\n\u201cI want to work in a bank when I graduation and other top positions like Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\n\u201cI also dreaming of becoming the next director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) like Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "title": "From space to space -- making our city work for all its inhabitants",
          "text": "BY ABDULWASIU OMOGBOLAHAN LAWAL\n\n1. It gives me great pleasure to be here at the occasion of the annual Lagos Architects Forum, and to be able to share with you my thoughts on what I believe should be the role of the architect in the city, and to some extent, other professionals in the built environment, in a post-pandemic era, and for the next couple of decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. To start with, I have always been intrigued by the way the built environment is developed and evolves, and even more so by the people who make the decisions that result in the environment that we all live in, or should I say, have to live with. As a former Commissioner of Housing in this State, I have had the opportunity to interact with many professionals in the built environment and have had discussions and exchanged ideas about the intentional steps that could be taken to make our cities work better for its inhabitants.\n\nSo, I have chosen to speak to a subject that I have themed \u201cFrom Space to Place \u2013 Making Our City Work for all its Inhabitants\u201d\n\n3. The world is undergoing massive urbanisation, at an unprecedented rate and Africa is not exempted. According to the World Bank, for the first time in history more than half the world\u2019s people live in cities and over 90 percent of urban growth is occurring in the developing world, adding an estimated 70 million new residents to urban areas each year. During the next two decades, the urban population of Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double. A report by Gensler puts this in some perspective \u2013 by 2050, we would need to build a city the size of London every month, for the next 400 months, to accommodate the increasing global urban population growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Talking about our beloved city \u2013 Lagos: This city is one of the few in the world in a phenomenon called \u2018hyper-urbanisation\u2019, with its attendant problems including micro and macro slum developments, crippling traffic congestion, poor waste collection and management amongst others. This raises the critical questions that I hope this Forum will answer. What kind of city should we be making? and having answered this, how should be go about making it?\n\n5. There is no doubt that the answer to these questions require some deep thoughts and engagements. But in my opinion, it starts with the primary building blocks of a city \u2013 the communities that connect together, make the city. The communities, in whatever economic strata they may be, are the foundations from which cities thrive. It therefore starts from how we engineer the spaces, and design the places within our communities, and directly, how the inhabitants interact and relate with these.\n\n6. One of the things that has become abundantly clear particularly after the global health episode that started at the end of 2019, is the important role public awareness of health plays in urban communities. It has become clearer that safer infrastructure and more open space are essential. My contribution today must not sound like a speech or even a thesis, so I would like to speak directly to how I believe we can ensure our city thrives when we design places that are connected, resilient, healthy and inspiring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. A city is all about connection, and fostering connectivity is not only about transportation and communication. At the heart of it, is access, how people are connected to their immediate environment \u2013 to green spaces and public spaces that enable cultural and civic engagements. It seems to me that as designers, more effort has to be put into making places for people beyond their homes and work. There is sufficient evidence to support the fact that increased connectivity reduces the tensions between groups in communities, establishes a sense of belonging and makes communities more dynamic and vibrant.\n\n8. To not mention designing healthy communities is to pretend that the pandemic did not expose some of the shortcomings in the design of the built environment, across the world. Public health and the design of cities are inseparably interwoven; the way we build our communities has a profound effect on our physical and mental health. Healthy communities ensure residents benefit from access to education, housing, jobs, the ability to live without fear of violence, freedom from environmental hazards and a meaningful built environment. Creating healthy communities is intentional. I am always intrigued by the fact that the 130Ha Hyde Park in London is not on the outskirts of the city but in the city centre, on a patch of some of the most expensive real estate in the world.\n\n9. The reason I would touch briefly on the subject of resilience is because I understand that communities that are unable to adapt to change and quickly recover from environmental, social or economic shifts will not survive. This suggests that designers must seriously consider the factors that impede or improve resilience. According to the UN, 70% of greenhouse gases comes from transportation and cooling/heating. What are the low-tech strategies that can counter this? I am personally committed to transforming Iru Kingdom into an urban green lung. Do we know that one tree removes 8cub.metres of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in a year, the equivalent of 11,000 miles of car emissions? So, why is tree planting and landscaping not of the same importance as thermal control or other comfort factors in design? Can we really speak about resilience when we give more importance to vehicular networks than pedestrian and low carbon means of transportation? Why are entire neighborhoods still being designed without exclusive pedestrianisation and extensive public spaces? Do we understand that investing in public spaces in the city is not only good for the community, but it is good for business and for the residents?\n\n10. I pose these questions only because we must challenge the norm and determine that the city will work for its inhabitants and not the other way around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Cities have to inspire. In the world\u2019s most livable cities, arts and culture blend with business, retail, entertainment and residential districts to create desirable places to live, work and play. These cities inspire and connect inhabitants and promote the healthy lifestyles that make them places where people enjoy spending time and achieving prosperity. Lagos is a magnet city, people are drawn here by a desire to belong, engage, \u2018hustle\u2019, \u2018make it\u2019, \u2018blow\u2019. Investing in public space matters a great deal. Public outdoor places are instrumental in creating community.\n\n12. I will not end this without sharing some of the work we have started to do since I became the Oniru of Iru kingdom. We have developed what we call the #LeGIT vision which literally means \u2018Let\u2019s Grow Iru Together\u2019. This is a vision that seeks to evolve Iru into a sustainable city, with a truly resilient people and to achieve this, I have spent the past year engaging with groups of stakeholders within and outside our community in order to ensure that we focus on sustaining the relationships that make cities viable, and that we spend the next couple of decades implementing projects that demonstrate how some of the principles I have espoused here work, In order to create livable communities that produce better outcomes for all. We have answers to the question \u201cwhat does Iru Kingdom want to be known for/as?\u201d\n\n13. It started with several months of data gathering. We have information about almost every relevant planning indices and metrics across the kingdom. While putting together our Kingdom Vision Document \u2013 \u201cThe Building of a Compact, Complete Community\u201d, we have commenced pilot projects around greening our environment through a tree planting campaign I initiated in February. So far almost 1000 trees have been planted. The next phase will involve the engagement of community groups in the tree planting drive and the planting of an additional 1000 trees. We have identified locations for several pocket parks and a large community park and have received proposals for the development of these. We have also started to install solar street lights in our communities. We have brought together a group of youths whom we refer to as environmental champions, in partnership with the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) to periodically conduct environmental sanitation and ensure that sanitary practices are upheld in Iru. Through this initiative, we have recovered and recycled over 1000 used Tyres amongst other items. We have also conducted beach cleanup exercises to uphold this and preserve life under water in alignment with \u2018SDG 14\u2019. We are in discussions regarding the review of vehicular movement within our communities and will develop solutions that give back some of our streets to humans in a carefully curated plan of creating a network of pedestrian and bicycle routes. We have initiated discussions with providers of neighborhood transportation and are keen to implement a carbon friendly solution.\n\n14. More importantly, we have made the decision that the journey of deploying best-practice principles in city development will be put in the hands of the experts. The development of a holistic master plan is therefore our next critical milestone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I believe strongly that it is possible to create a better world through the power of design. It starts with a focus on people and the places and spaces they occupy every day, human-centric design \u2014 design solutions that prioritise human experience. Through this lens, we can reimagine the future of our cities. We can shape the environment, but, the environment in turn, then shapes us, so perhaps my question should not be \u201cwhat kind of city should we be making?\u201d but \u201cwhat kind of people do we want to be\u201d.\n\n16. I thank you all for your attention.\n\nSpeech delivered by Omogbolahan Lawal (Abisogun II), the Oniru of Iru Land at 2021 Lagos Architects Forum",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "Is there a ride-hailing service in Gabon? Yes, Gozem just launched there this week.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Emeka Ajene and Raphael Dana, Gozem operates an app that offers transportation, logistics, e-commerce and financial services in primarily-francophone African countries.\n\nGozem is aiming to be the super app for Africa and is modelled after the success of Gojek and WeChat in Southeast Asia and China respectively. While it is only one of many super app candidates in Africa, geographic expansion is a signal of strong intent.\n\nUntil the rollout in Gabon, Gozem was only available in cities across Togo and Benin, offering motorcycle taxis, tricycle taxis, and delivery of groceries, gas bottles, and meals.\n\nThe company says it has more than 500,000 registered users who have completed more than 2.5 million trips since inception.\n\nGabon will be Gozem\u2019s first operation outside of West Africa. The Central African country\u2019s population is under 2.5 million with almost 75% under the age of 30.\n\nScreenshots of the Gozem app. Image source: Gozem.\n\nThe ride-hailing feature is the only service Gabonese users will find on the app at the moment and it is only available in Libreville, the capital city.\n\n\u201cOur immediate focus is on providing a high-quality, reliable taxi service in that city, and then expanding the range of services we offer to Libreville\u2019s population,\u201d Ajene, Gozem co-founder and CEO, said to TechCabal.\n\nLaunching a taxi service in Gabon helps the company \u201cdiversify away from our beginnings as a 100% motorcycle-taxi oriented platform.\u201d\n\nWith Libreville in the mix, Gozem now operates in 10 cities across West and Central Africa. Ajene notes that most are not capital cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed an in-house capability to operate effectively in secondary cities in the region and there are one or two additional cities that you might ultimately see Gozem operating in in Gabon,\u201d he said.\n\nOne point of curiosity in this expansion is that Gabon is a smaller country by population compared to Togo (~8 million) and Benin (~ 12 million). Ajene acknowledges that but explains that purchasing power is another consideration that bears on expansion plans.\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita,\u201d Ajene said.\n\nIndeed, Gabon\u2019s 2020 GDP per capita was estimated to be $7,185, more than thrice the sum of Benin\u2019s $1,259 and Togo\u2019s $690.\n\n\n\nGozem\u2019s ride-hailing offering will work in Gabon like a standard app-enabled taxi booking service. Users download, sign up and input their destination to request rides. Driver accepts and the fare is calculated by distance. Users can pay in cash, with Airtel Money or Moov Money, or by credit card.\n\nRaphael Dana, Gozem co-founder, says the launch responds to the needs of the Gabonese population and aligns with Gozem\u2019s long-term plan to organise transport and commerce in Africa around the ongoing smartphone and internet revolution.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to consolidate our status as the premier super app in Africa, and this expansion to Central Africa, our first foray outside of West Africa, also allows us to prepare our upcoming expansion to Cameroon,\u201d Dana said.\n\nThe expansion to Cameroon is on the calendar for this year; DR Congo is also being explored. Beyond moving into new countries to enable taxis however, Gozem plans to make its other verticals compete with incumbents in the markets they currently operate.\n\n\u201cWe have robust food & e-commerce delivery verticals, we\u2019re beginning to see a significant impact coming from our vehicle financing vertical as well, and our plans for our full-service wallet are still on track,\u201d Ajene said.",

Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

It also launched the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.\n\nThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration reiterated the mandatory use of NIN for all sim registration\n\nThe National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector is in line with the eighth pillar in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) Document unveiled in November 2019 by the President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eighth pillar, titled \u201cIndigenous Content Development and Adoption\u201d, is to provide a policy framework to identify jobs that are currently being outsourced and support the repatriation of these jobs to digitally skilled Nigerians.\n\nOne of the implementation strategies of the pillar states that the government will increase the patronage of digital startups, enabling them to access a minimum percentage of government-funded jobs.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the Nigerian government is not known to give its ICT contracts to Nigerian startups.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja \u2013 The Federal Government has expressed optimism that the strike of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), would end soon.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, expressed this believe while addressing newsmen at the end of a conciliation meeting between the government negotiating team, and the two unions on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nNgige said government had made offers to the two unions, and their representatives would consult with their various National Executive Committees (NEC), and revert back.\n\nThe minister said a lot of work went into the government\u2019s proposal to the two unions, which substantially addressed their demands for judicial and legislative autonomy.\n\n\u201cA lot of work went in. We have exchanged briefs with JUSUN and PASAN.\n\n\u201cThey have their demands, which they had earlier submitted. The government has given counter offers and properly addressed the burning issue of financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nHe said that questions were asked and answered, while critical observations were made and explained, working on the proposal given by the government.\n\nAccording to him, the meeting has been adjourned with a view to enable JUSUN and PASAN take back the government proposal to their members of their National Executive Committees.\n\n\u201cWe expect them to work on the documents from tomorrow and if they are satisfied, they should inform us.\n\n\u201cAnd you know that when they are satisfied, the logical thing is to call-off the industrial action. So, we are to receive their views on the government offer by Tuesday morning,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige, however, said over all, the discussions had been very fruitful, adding that they had moved from the initial position of ground zero, to ground 85.\n\nHe therefore, appealed to the striking workers to return to work to enable government meet the remaining part of their demands.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this when legislation is closed in various states.

The future of Edo State is very bright; our citizens must not lose hope in this Government. All we need to do is to look inward and organise ourselves.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t have strong institutions, as godfathers, in the past, replaced the institutions. It\u2019s not godfathers that determine the way a state or system should be run but the people and the institutions.\n\n\u201cWe must have strong institutions that will make the system work without depending on any godfather to determine the way things are done. Government will always come and go but the institutions remain. Our focus is to ensure that everything works because we have to give account of taxpayers\u2019 money. Government can\u2019t be singlehandedly hijacked by some persons.\u201d\n\nNoting the role of Edo women in ensuring socio-economic development in the state, Obaseki said: \u201cThe women are the pillar which our society rests and if not for them I may not have been Governor for a second term as they are the ones helping to confront the \u2018Lions and Tigers\u2019 threatening to distract our government from working for the people We have no choice but to work for Edo people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe campaigned against godfathers during the September election and we won to push them out of the system. Godfathers have replaced institutions. What happened on September 19, 2020 was to vote out the mentality of godfatherism,\u201d he added.\n\nOn her part, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki advocated for the women to be appointed into vital political positions to enable them contribute their quota to the development of the nation.\n\nAddressing the women, she said: \u201cI urge you people to be ready to contribute to the development of the state by changing the narrative of getting involved in politics. I encourage you people to also pay your tax and be committed to good governance.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "By Innocent Odoh, Abuja\n\nThe telecom industry regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has warmed telecom consumers on the dangers of sharing their phones, National Identity Number (NIN) and Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card with other people, stressing that they will face the consequences for any crime committed with the SIM.\n\nNCC director of consumer affairs bureau, Efeosa Edehen, gave this warning on Thursday during an enlightenment dialogue organised for residents of Abuja with the theme \u2018Know your Rights and Obligations as a Telecom Consumer\u2019.\n\nHe said consumers should be very careful with their devices so they don\u2019t fall into the hands of wrong people who would use them to commit crime and later it would be traced to the owner of the device, NIN or SIM card.\n\n\u201cDo not help other people to link their SIM cards with your NIN, Handle your phone with care. Be careful how you give your phones to other people to make calls, send texts, or use social media. Your phone carries your identity and therefore should be protected and always be with you.\n\n\u201cNote that you will be responsible for whatever wrong/offense someone else committed while using your SIM card(s). So, be very vigilant,\u201d he warned.\n\nEdehen also advised Nigerians to take advantage of the time extension for the NIN-SIM linkage by the Federal Government, to enroll and link their NIN to their SIM, warning that the government might not have further extension and those lines which are not linked to the NIN might be blocked after the deadline.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the new deadline for the NIN-SIM linkage exercise is now June 30, 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs a citizen, it is very important and necessary to register for National Identity Number (NIN) and to ensure your NIN is linked to your SIM cards,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said further said that, \u201cConsumers have the right to receive clear and complete terms and conditions for service agreement and disclosures of price for goods and services, and to affirmatively accept all terms and conditions before being charged for services. They have the right to be protected against fraudulent, misleading and deceitful information or advertisement or labelling.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Communications Act 2003 (NCA Act 2003) and Consumer Code of Practice & Regulations 2007 (CCPR 2007) ensure that service Providers deal reasonably with the consumers by providing them with information on their service that is complete, accurate, and up to date and in simple and clear language.\u201d\n\nHe added that NCC was collaborating with the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), security agencies, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other relevant bodies to ensure security in the use of the telecom network.\n\nHe also urged parents and guardians to teach their children/wards on the proper use of internet, adding \u201cmake sure your child realises that they should never give out personal details such as names, address, school names, and telephone numbers to online friends they do not know.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the \u201cawareness on SIM-NIN linkage\u201d, representative of the Project Development Manager, Nnenna Ukoha, said that Nigerians who fail to link their NIN to their SIM would not be able to do bank transactions as the banks would soon begin to ask that customers tie their NIN to their bank accounts.\n\nShe also warned that those without NIN might not get drivers license and voters card, adding that they will not also enjoy the benefits of health insurance scheme or the contributing pension scheme.",

This is no doubt an auspicious time for the family he left behind,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a thing of pride to have his son taking after him, but unfortunately he left before his father and mother. It\u2019s so painful.\n\n\u201cI will however with all humility ask my mentor to take heart, no need to sorrow or weep, Pastor Dare is already in Heaven.\n\n\u201cHe was called home in accordance with the will of God. God never revealed it to Pastor Adeboye because He is God and moreover, God may not be able to resist the entreaties of Pastor Adeboye for his son to be spared if He had revealed it to him.\n\n\u201cPastor Adeboye is a man dearly loved by God because of his humility. In 1994, I attended his crusade in Ibadan, where he surprisingly prophesied the emergence of a South West person becoming the President of Nigeria, to be sincere, I doubted the prophecy.\n\n\u201cEventually the prophecy came to pass 5 years after, that was in 1999, Olusegun Obasanjo was elected President.

They shall never support this government, and they will destroy any development that shall come to Plateau, even the existing ones.\n\n\u201cAgain, they are ready for Jihad in the state as we have presently secured the needed arms. Over 3,000 foreign arms have now entered Jos, and we will not vote during the governorship election,\u201d the communique seen by Peoples Gazette said.\n\nMr Pantami and his colleagues also concluded that they \u201cshall use our men who are in the military to help us bring arms and ammunition into Kaduna.\u201d",

          "text": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. was warned by its compliance team over the \u201cgreat risk\u201d of corruption just days before it made the last of three transfers that totaled $875 million to former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete.\n\nThe internal memo is set to be scrutinized in a London lawsuit brought by the West African nation. The U.S. bank is accused of ignoring red flags when it transferred funds between 2011 to 2013 from government accounts to Etete, who had been convicted of money laundering.\n\nThe current government says a contract awarded by one of its predecessors to explore the deep waters off the Gulf of Guinea was corrupt.\n\nEuropean and Nigerian courts have been raking over the purchase by Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc of the oil license in Africa\u2019s largest crude producer a decade ago.\n\nWhile the energy giants were recently acquitted of corruption charges in Milan in a decision prosecutors could appeal, Nigeria\u2019s government is continuing to seek compensation from JPMorgan.\n\nThe memo disclosed at a London court hearing this week shows what JPMorgan managers knew about the oil contract and when, lawyers for the Nigerian government said in court documents. A spokesperson for the investment bank declined to comment.\n\nThe government claims Etete distributed a portion of the funds received via the bank from the oil majors to corrupt former and serving senior public officials.\n\nThe bank has denied any wrongdoing and says it\u2019s being held responsible for not protecting the Nigerian people from their own government.\n\nThe government says that by 2013 JPMorgan\u2019s internal concerns over payments to Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. \u2014 a firm controlled by Etete \u2014 were escalating to more senior members of the bank.\n\n\u201cIn light of Malabu\u2019s reported connection to the alleged Nigerian corruption scheme, there would be great risk presented if JPMC continues to process wires involving Malabu,\u201d a compliance officer based in the U.S. wrote in a memo dated Aug. 23, 2013.\n\nJust six days later, JPMorgan made a payment of $75.2 million to the Malabu account.\n\nLawyers for the Nigerian government said in court Wednesday it wants to know how the memo was compiled and asked a judge for more emails and documents from the compliance team.\n\nIt\u2019s seeking details on how compliance monitored and placed controls over questionable payments including a so-called \u201cinterdiction list\u201d \u2014 a tool to prevent transfers from being automatically cleared. Malabu was placed on the list in November 2013.\n\nBloomberg",

          "text": "At least 25 people have been killed after hundreds of heavily armed police stormed into one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s largest slum areas, reportedly targeting drug traffickers.\n\nLocal media showed live footage of seven armed young men hopping through the roofs of North Zone\u2019s Jacarezinho favela in the early hours of Thursday morning, as bulletproof helicopters hovered over them.\n\nThe report said the \u201cextremely suspicious criminals\u201d were attempting to escape from the police. Two passengers on the metro were hit by a stray bullet and one police officer was killed.\n\nVideos and photos shared with Al Jazeera by residents showed grenade explosions, as well as horrific scenes of corpses lying in corridors, multiple bullet holes on residents doors, blood-stained mattresses and clothes and blood flowing down staircases in the favela\u2019s narrow alleys.\n\nThe Brazilian media widely applauded the operation \u2013 they and Rio\u2019s Civil and Federal Police force have said was a justified crackdown on drug trafficking and other violent crimes in the community.\n\nBut human rights activists, residents and public security specialists were horrified and said that the attack could have been motivated by other factors.\n\n\u201cNever in my life have I seen a police operation as lethal as this,\u201d Bruno Soares, a researcher from Rio\u2019s Centre for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThe police officer was killed before 9am in the morning, this could have influenced the number of deaths with the police invading with more force,\u201d added Soares, who was born and raised in the Jacarezinho favela.\n\nSoares, who was in the favela when the operation took place, said that it was unlikely that all the people killed in the operation were criminals.\n\nThe police have yet to release information on who was killed but residents said that most of the killings were not from shoot-outs.\n\n\u201cOne of the men asked to hide in my home. When the police came, I told them that there was someone here, as they would have come in anyway. They went to my daughter\u2019s room and shot him instantly,\u201d said one favela resident in a video shared with Al Jazeera.\n\nMonica, a human rights activist, who was also in the favela when the raids took place said the police invaded homes in what she describes as \u201ctrue extermination\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was carnage.\u201d\n\nJoel Luiz Costa, a lawyer and resident of the favela whose team visited multiple houses after the shootings took place, called the operation \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cbarbaric\u201d in a video posted on social media. He said there were clear signs of \u201cexecution-style killings\u201d.\n\nLast year, Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the police to suspend operations during the Covid-19 pandemic, which is raging in Brazil, restricting them to \u201cabsolutely exceptional circumstances\u201d.\n\nInitially, after the Supreme Court ban deaths from police operations plunged 70 percent compared with the average from previous months, according to a study from Rio\u2019s Federal Fluminense University. But deaths have since returned after Rio Governor Claudio Castro took office last October.\n\nThe country\u2019s highest court has yet to comment whether Thursday\u2019s deadly operation falls under that exception.\n\nThe court also requires the police to ask the Public Ministry for approval at least 24 hours before an operation.\n\nMedia reports said the Public Ministry had approved of the operation. But Soares, of the Centre for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship, claimed that the ministry only received information of the operation three hours after it began.\n\nAccording to a report by the Human Rights Watch, more than 1,200 people were killed by the Rio police force last year. The majority of the people killed are from poor, lower-class neighbourhoods and peripheries.\n\nA separate report from Fogo Cruzado, a digital platform that monitors armed violence in Rio, said that more than 100 children have been killed by stray bullets in the past five years, and the majority go unpunished.\n\n\u201cOperations like today unfortunately are very common in Rio de Janeiro. The police treat raids as completely normal, which each time become more violent. When we have the most deadly police operation in our history, this says a lot,\u201d Cecilia Oliveira, founder of Fogo Cruzado, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOliveira said aside from the city\u2019s police force, the state and Public Ministry should also be held accountable.\n\n\u201cThe Public Ministry rarely investigates police violence, this gives the police impunity. The police don\u2019t do anything alone. It\u2019s not just the finger of the police that pushes the trigger.\u201d",

          "text": "Public health experts have recommended a version of the Indian Covid variant found in the UK to be made a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, the BBC has been told.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) has been tracking a variant known as B.1.617.2, which appears to have been spreading more quickly in the UK than others.\n\nScientists believe it is more transmissible than the version of Covid first discovered in Wuhan, China.\n\nA spokesman for PHE said it would not comment on leaked data.\n\nViruses mutate all the time, producing different versions of themselves. Most of these mutations are insignificant \u2013 and some may even make the virus less dangerous \u2013 but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against.\n\nThe Kent, South Africa and Brazil strains have all been deemed \u201cvariants of concern\u201d in the UK. These versions, along with the India variant, have all undergone changes to their spike protein \u2013 the part of the virus which attaches to human cells.\n\nThe original India variant \u2013 officially known as B.1.617 \u2013 was first detected in the country in October.\n\nThat version has now been re-characterised as three different subtypes, all with slightly different genetic mutations.\n\nThe UK has seen a sharp increase in one version in particular, known as B.1.617.2, which now makes up the majority of all Indian variant cases and appears to be growing faster than other versions.\n\nPHE scientists think with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that it spreads at least as quickly as the version of the virus first found in Kent last year \u2013 known as B.1.1.7 \u2013 which is currently dominant in the UK.\n\nBut a source has told the BBC there is no evidence this version of the Indian variant is resistant to current vaccines.\n\nIt does not feature the E.484K mutation found in the South African variant of the virus, which could help the virus dodge a person\u2019s immune system and may affect how well coronavirus vaccines work.\n\nIt is believed that more than 500 cases of B.1.617.2 have now been detected across England with the highest levels in London and the north-west of England.\n\nThat would represent a sharp rise from the 202 cases officially recorded by PHE in the UK as of 28 April.\n\nIt is not known how many of the current infections in the UK can be linked back to international travel.\n\nHowever, it is thought there has already been some evidence of \u201csignificant\u201d community transmission, mainly linked to workplaces and religions gatherings.\n\nIn one cluster at a care home, 14 elderly residents who have all been vaccinated were infected with the variant, the source said. A number needed hospital treatment but not for severe disease, and it is thought all have now recovered.\n\nAll current vaccines are thought to offer some degree of protection against variants but can never completely stop all Covid infections, especially among the vulnerable or elderly.\n\nLaboratory work is needed to sequence individual Covid tests and identify specific variants, meaning the latest figures are likely to represent the situation around a week ago.\n\nFigures from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which analyses positive swabs for different variants, also showed clusters of B.1.617.2 in places including Leicester, Bolton, Nottingham and Blackburn in the week to 24 April.\n\nIt comes as seven confirmed cases of the B.1.617.2 variant have been detected in Northern Ireland \u2013 the first discovered in the region.\n\nScientists at Public Health England have now recommended that the B.1.617.2 variant should be formally designated a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, the BBC has been told, with India and the World Health Organization expected to be informed of the change later.\n\nDr William Welfare, the Covid-19 incident director at PHE, said: \u201cPublic Health England is monitoring the situation closely and appropriate public health interventions, including targeted testing and enhanced contact tracing, are being undertaken.\u201d\n\nGovernment statistics show 127,583 people have now died, up 13 in the latest 24-hour period. In total 4,428,553 people have tested positive, up 2,613 in the latest 24-hour period. Latest figures show 1,289 people in hospital. In total, 34,934,171 people have received their first vaccination and 16,291,719 have had their second dose\n\nThe government has previously rolled out increased Covid testing to prevent the spread of outbreaks of more contagious variants \u2013 in a process known as surge testing.\n\nExtra tests and enhanced contact tracing is carried out in very specific locations \u2013 local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets.\n\nIn April, households in various of areas of Birmingham were asked to take Covid-19 PCR tests after a small number of cases of the South Africa variant were found in the city.\n\nIndia has said the B.1.617 variant may be linked to a deadly second coronavirus wave that has swept the country in recent weeks.\n\nThe country reported a record 412,000 cases in the space of 24 hours on Wednesday, and 3,980 deaths.\n\nThe surge in infections has already overwhelmed the healthcare system with hospital beds, oxygen and even crematorium space in short supply, while several states are under localised lockdowns and curfews.",
