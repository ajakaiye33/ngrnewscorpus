          "text": "Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun on Thursday assured that he would neither slash workers\u2019 salaries nor reverse the recently signed minimum wage in the state inspite of the harsh economic realities in the country.\n\nAbiodun gave the assurance in Abeokuta during the breaking of the fast (Iftar) with the leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress in Abeokuta.\n\nThe governor stated that his administration would continue to be creative in its bid to make the state economically viable and financially strong to be able to perform its responsibilities to the citizens.\n\n\u201cI was watching on television where I saw one of my brother governors say that his state might have to reverse on the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cWe are very creative on the issue of financing and I want to assure you that Ogun will not reverse on minimum wage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor also assured that the local government polls scheduled to hold on July 24 across the state would be free and fair to all.\n\n\u201cThe election will not be skewed in favour of the rullng APC.\n\n\u201cWe will not share political positions among men and women who are party faithfuls during the elections, but promote equal participation.\n\n\u201cWe must be consistent and show that we have learnt from other people\u2019s lessons and that are a product of democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have done primaries when somebody else did not want primaries and subjected ourselves to the party process and we evolved through that process which was later confirmed by the general elections despite all odds.\n\n\u201cLet us make sure that whatever process we adopt is democratic. We must be seen as true progressive democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to a process like this, what we need to do is to encourage our members to come forward and participate.\n\n\u201cWe will vote for them, but we are not going to share it and say because they are our members, they should take it on platter of gold.\n\n\u201cNo, that will be undemocratic. We are not going to do that because it will be unfair,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on security, Abiodun disclosed that his administration would soon re-launch the OPMESA, which according to him, has recently been resuscitated after years of neglect by the immediate past administration.\n\nHe added that any act of insecurity would be viewed as a sabotage against its government\u2019s plans to grow the economy of the state.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the issue of security very seriously and be assured that we are doing everything humanly possible on this because Ogun is the industrial hub of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAny act of insecurity is a sabotage against our plans to make our state very viable economically and we are going to fight it with everything at our disposal.\n\n\u201cOPMESA has gone for so many years because the previous administration did not take it very seriously, so, the federal government withdrew it.\n\n\u201cBut I went after that initiative and I got the Chief of Army Staff to finally approve it because like I said to him, I don\u2019t know of other states, but my state, I cannot afford insecurity,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile restating his administration\u2019s commitment to make the state safe for the residents, Abiodun urged he people of the state to be prayerful and be observant of their environment, saying that \u201csecurity agents are as good as the intelligence they gathered\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the APC Caretaker Committee Chairman in Ogun, Mr Yemi Sanusi, commended Abiodun for embarking on massive road rehabilitation and re-construction across the state.\n\nHe also lauded him for attracting more members into the party, particularly, bigwigs from other political parties.\n\nTwo former deputy governors of the state, Mr Segun Adesegun and Sen. Adegbenga Kaka, who also attended the event, commended the governor for his effort at making the state more attractive for investors.\n\nAdewunmi Onanuga, a lawmaker, representing Remo Constituency at the House of Representatives, commended the governor for his developmental agenda in the state.\n\nShe, however, called on the governor to give women more opportunities to represent their people at the grassroots.

Somalia is no longer the same today, because of war.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to even witness war throughout my lifetime, because we knew what we lost in Yoruba race during the 2020 #EndSARS protest.\n\n\u201cOn our part as YAF members, we want to warn sternly that we won\u2019t allow any group or individual to turn the Southwest into a theatre of war.\n\n\u201cOur Yoruba brothers involved in this evil enterprise or plot to destabilise the Yoruba race should retrace their steps to avoid dire consequences.\n\n\u201cWe recorded huge losses in the southwest during the #EndSARS protest in terms of burnt property worth trillions of naira, not to talk of valuable human lives destroyed due to the violence that followed the EndSARS.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, police, and men of the Nigerian army and other security agencies should take urgent steps to stop the Yoruba independence agitators and freedom fighters before they set the entire country ablaze\u201d.\n\nAnimashaun urged the federal government to display its political will by propelling the Department of State Services, military, and the police to activate their machinery against these elements in the southwest before the situation escalates.\n\nHe said if actions are not taken swiftly to checkmate the rising violent tendencies of the agitators, the southwest will be immersed into unprecedented cataclysm.\n\nAnimashaun added that; \u201cThese agitators were being emboldened by the recent spate of attacks on security infrastructure and personnel in the Southeast, especially the attacks on police stations and killings of innocent policemen.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that the masterminds of this violence are bent on throwing Nigeria into chaos to put governments at both state and federal levels into violence to enable them execute their respective evil plans for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that these elements have begun to mobilise their members in the southwest for the next phase of their so-called agitation for Yoruba indepedence and self determination by engaging in more violent protests and bloody confrontations with government.\n\n\u201cBut should they refuse to take our modest advice to desist from their devilish plans and unpatriotic activities in Yorubaland, they should be prepared to face dire consequences as we would no longer fold our arms and allow them destroy our peace, economy and social wellbeing\u201d, the YAF boss stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, and Nigerian Communications Satellite, NIGCOMSAT, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, for the early deployment of the Fifth Generation Network, 5G.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Executive Vice Chairman, EVC, of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, noted that amongst the Frequency Spectrum bands allocated to 5G by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the C-band (3.4GHz \u2013 3.9GHz) stands out because its balancing point between coverage and capacity provides the perfect environment for 5G connectivity.\n\nHe explained that the C-band is most suitable and appropriate for immediate deployment of 5G services taking into consideration availability of device ecosystem with 60-70% of global commercial 5G network deployment currently in the band, thus the importance of this Spectrum for early deployment of 5G services in Nigeria cannot be overemphasized.\n\nHe said that for optimal 5G service performance, an average of contiguous 100 MHz of spectrum in the C-band is required by an Operator. However, in Nigeria, only 120 MHz of the band (3.4 \u2013 3.52) GHz is available for mobile services while the remaining 680 MHz (3.52 \u2013 4.2) GHz of the band is used by NigComSat (NG-1R) satellites.\n\nThe EVC said that the Commission initiated a negotiation with NIGCOMSAT whom in their estimate could make some adjustment to its satellite operation and release part of its Spectrum holding in the band to facilitate the deployment of 5G in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe impeccable team at NigComSat proved us right. [I want to] use this medium to appreciate the Management of the NigComSat under the distinguished leadership of my Sister Dr. Abimbola Alale for demonstrating that the interest of our dear country is paramount to our organizational or personal interest,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\n\u201cThe two agencies have been in discussions on how to relocate the operations of NG-1R to the standard C-band 300MHz (3.9GHz \u2013 4.2GHz) potion of the band, which is more suitable in terms of Satellite service offering because the end-user terminal is cheaper there while leaving the non-standard C-band 400MHz (3.5GHz \u2013 3.9GHz) portion of the band for 5G use. The cost of relocating the NG-1R is expected to be offset from the proceeds of the auction of the 5G Spectrum.\n\n\u201cThe two agencies have developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) detailing all the aspect of this undertaking.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to sign the MOU for further execution. It is my belief that the impact of this decision knows no bounds and will not only strengthen the relationship between both agencies but would also go a long way in making a positive impact on the Nigerian economy.\u201d",

You know they threatened to kill all of them (students) after a particular deadline but after talking to them, they are now lowering their bar.\n\n\u201cSo, we are thankful they have stopped killing. And we are still negotiating with them. I hope this Afaka case will also encourage them to know that there is hope in negotiation and release the children.\u201d\n\nRead Also: The Sheikh Gumi terrorism paradox\n\nSpeaking on his role in the release of the 27 Afaka students, Gumi said: \u201cThe role myself and former President Olusegun Obasanjo played in the release of the 27 Afaka students is the role of mediators because the fight is not between us and them but between the bandits and the government.\n\n\u201cWhat we understand is that these people were trying to attack the government by attacking the government institutions and take innocent children.\n\n\u201cHaving understood that, we came to the conclusion that, this is not a hopeless situation. We can really go in and negotiate for the release of these children which we did after so much ups and downs.\n\n\u201cBut in the long run, a conclusion was reached and these children are out. So, we are happy that, all of them are out and none was killed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the reported swap of a bandit for the students, Sheikh Gumi said: \u201cI cannot confirm that but I can quote the Governor of Kaduna when the children of Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cHe said it is the duty of the government to use whatever means possible to save the lives of Chibok girls. This is a general rule that life is more precious. Now, I am happy that, 27 lives have been saved.\u201d\n\nThe Afaka parents were led by their chairman and spokesman, Usman Abdullahi and Friday Sanni.\n\nThey thanked the Islamic cleric and begged him to help convey their appreciation to former President Obasanjo who worked alongside the cleric to bring back their children from captivity.",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nThe Senate on Thursday grilled heads of security agencies for over four hours behind closed doors.\n\nThis followed its resolution last week to meet with security authorities over growing insecurity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Senate went into a closed session at about 11.20am and rose at 3.20pm.\n\nSecurity chiefs present at the session were: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Leo Irabor; Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao; Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo and the Acting Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman.\n\nOthers were: Directors-General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Ahmed Rufai Abubakar; Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) Maj-Gen S.A. Adebayo and Directorate of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi among others.\n\nIt was learnt the CDS briefed the Senate on behalf of the Service Chiefs while the Inspector General of Police and heads of intelligence agencies elaborated on the internal security challenges across the country.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan said the meeting will be held behind closed door.\n\nChairman Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru briefed Senate Correspondents after the over four hour closed session with the security chiefs.\n\nBasiru said: \u201cAt an executive session they briefed the Senate comprehensively on the state of security in the country, analysis of the various operations and theatre of activities that they are engaged in, the topography across the six geopolitical zones, the complexities and the challenges that are being faced and ways by which they believe the parliament can work together with the executive and the heads of security agencies to ensure we rein in the atmosphere of insecurity and ensure a long lasting peace and security for our country.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe did not talk about money. We did not talk about figure. We had a high level discussion on general challenges and requirements for us to have an efficient and effective security.\n\n\u201cThe details of what ever will go into supplementary appropriation can only be worked upon by the Ministry of Finance, which is an executive arm together with our relevant Committee and such are not matters that we will go into details.\n\n\u201cOf course, everybody knows that security is a serious matter for which you cannot take with levity when it comes to ensuring appropriate appropriation for that. We are ready to receive supplementary budget.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any doubt that there is synergy among the various security agencies. In fact, from the nature of the briefing that we received, it reassured us as elected representatives of the people that there is indeed a synergy.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Senate is satisfied with plans of the security agencies, Basiru said: \u201cI believe that going forward, the confidence has been built between the security chiefs on one hand and the Nigerian parliament on the other hand and that would be a good signal of what we expect in the future.\u201d",

Their plan was to even send me to Rome after the 30 days.\n\n\u201cI asked them why I was being punished. They cannot not tell me who to bless. They are angry that I blessed Nnamdi Kanu. I am a priest of God and nobody can tell me who to bless. Is it your blessing? Are you the one giving him life? Are you the one giving him life? Go and take away God\u2019s blessings from him.\n\n\u201cIf you said I spoke against government is there no insecurity in the country? Are they angry that I said government should provide jobs for the youths? I am a priest of God and I will continue to bless and speak the truth.\n\n\u201cI saw the implication of keeping me there. I told them that my people will look for me if they don\u2019t allow me to attend today\u2019s programme (E no dey again).\n\n\u201cWhat would have happened if I had has left Enugu as they instructed? We are a people of peace so I want you all to be peaceful. We wilI meet here again on Sunday God willing.\u201d\n\nPandemonium had broken out, yesterday, as thousands of adherents took to the streets seeking the whereabouts of the fiery priest.\n\nHis followers had stormed the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Bishop Callistus Onaga, demanding his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to the protesters, Bishop had invited Mbaka for a meeting by 10am on Tuesday and they had neither seen nor heard from him since then.\n\nThe cleric, however, showed up at about 2:50pm as tension was reaching a breaking point on his whereabouts with many alleging that government was complicit in his \u2018disappearance\u2019.\n\nHe emerged at the junction of Igboeze Street where he alighted from an SUV and urged protesters to return to Adoration Ground in Umuchigbo for him to address them. It was learnt that the priest may have emerged from the Government House axis of Enugu.\n\nEyewitnesses said having received no positive response and fearing that the bishop may have handed the priest to security agents, the protesters had descended on Bishop\u2019s Court, residence of Bishop Onaga, and vandalised property, especially glasses, doors, the Bishop\u2019s office before marching to destroy a bookshop, guest house, two buildings, four big water tanks and other facilities at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Some workers there sustained various degrees of injury.\n\nThere was heavy presence of joint security forces of the army, police, National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services both at the Bishop\u2019s Court and the Holy Ghost Cathedral.\n\nDSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, had denied that Mbaka was in their custody.\n\nFears of his possible arrest arose as Mbaka last week Wednesday called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over worsening security challenges in the country.\n\nLast Sunday, the DSS issued a warning to individuals and groups to be mindful of utterances and actions that threatened the country\u2019s peace and sovereignty.",

          "text": "\u2022Propose percentage payment of statutory allocation to legislative arm\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nGovernors have shifted ground in their quest for an earnest resolution of the industrial crisis caused by the clamour by judicial and legislative workers for the implementation of financial autonomy for the two arms of government.\n\nTHISDAY gathered yesterday that the governors had proposed to pay lawmakers a certain percentage of their statutory monthly entitlements towards funding the legislature.\n\nA source said the governors\u2019 offer followed the refusal of speakers of Houses of Assembly of the 36 states of the federation to accept the N100 million monthly offer made by the governors for each state legislature.\n\nIn rejecting the irreducible minimum payment of N100 million monthly to each of the legislatures in the states to fund their operations, the speakers had insisted on N250 million monthly.\n\nIt was also gathered that the governors had also rejected the demand of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) that the gross allocations should be remitted to the two arms of government directly.\n\nThe governors\u2019 hard-line position was said to be responsible for the delay in the resolution of the strike embarked upon by judicial and parliamentary workers in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to press for the implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nHowever, the governors agreed that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will handle funds for states\u2019 judicial councils to take care of the high courts while the state governments will be responsible for funding the magistrates and customary courts.\n\nIn a bid to resolve the issues and end the ongoing industrial dispute, the federal government has invited the leadership of JUSUN and PASAN to a negotiation today.\n\nA statement by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, said the Minister, Senator Chris Ngige, would host the negotiations with the workers.\n\nAn earlier plan to hold talks with the striking workers was stalled by a lack of harmony in the positions of the team representing the federal government and that of governors.\n\nThe Solicitor-General of the Federation, Mr. Dayo Apata, who had represented the federal government, and the Director-General of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Mr. Asishana Okauru, had presented different position papers, which stalled negotiations.\n\nBut a source told THISDAY yesterday that the two parties had reached a consensus, while all the grey areas have been resolved.\n\nHe confirmed that Ngige would schedule a meeting with the leadership of JUSUN and PASAN to sort out any other outstanding issues.\n\nHe said: \u201cRight now; there\u2019s a consensus. There\u2019s some agreement, grey areas have been cleared and I think the minister is committed to putting a meeting together with the workers and in the next couple of days. I think all the grey areas will be sorted out.\n\n\u201cSome of the grey areas for the judiciary, for instance, is that it is clear to all the parties now that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will be handling that because that\u2019s the position of the constitution. They have been doing that for recurrent at the state level, but have not been doing it for capital spending.\n\n\u201cThat will continue, especially for courts of record. The governors will be in charge of customary courts and magistrates courts.\n\n\u201cFor the legislature, the major issue was whether the deduction should be based on gross or net. What they have agreed is that it is going to be an agreed percentage of appropriated amount.\u201d\n\nFollowing the different positions adopted by the federal government and the governors, Ngige had urged the governors to rework the agreement for negotiations to resume.\n\nThe governors had accepted in principle the funding of both the state legislatures and judiciaries from their allocations from the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), to be deducted from the States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC).\n\nAs part of its implementation, the state governments were expected from May 1, to set up the States Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC) with members from the states Assembly committee chairmen on Finance and the States Commissioners of Finance to discuss on monthly basis the disbursement of funds.\n\nHowever, the governors and speakers could not reach a consensus on how much to be given to each state legislature monthly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges release of kidnapped Greenfield university scholars\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed excitement at the news of the release of the remaining 29 students of the Federal College of Forestry, Afaka, Kaduna abducted from their school 55 days ago.\n\nChairman of the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students, Mr. Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the release of the students to THISDAY.\n\n\u201cYes, they have been released. They did not sleep in the (bandits) camp yesterday. They were taken to the residence of one of the mediators to sleep. We have already sent our people with vehicles and ambulances to go and bring them. We are expecting them any moment from now,\u201d Usman said.\n\nThe bandits had invaded the school on March 11 and abducted 39 of the students.\n\nThey later freed 10 of them in two batches of five after the parents had reportedly paid N17 million ransoms.\n\nUsman described the release of the students as \u201ca big relief to parents,\u201d who have been emotionally traumatised since the incident.\n\nThe parents had on Tuesday protested at the National Assembly in Abuja.\n\nHowever, attempts to confirm the release of the students from the police were unsuccessful as Mr. Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command was unreachable on the telephone.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the release of the students was nearly frustrated following a claim by one of the parents during their protest in Abuja on Tuesday that they paid N800, 000 to one of the mediators.\n\nA source among the parents told THISDAY that the claim by the woman that they paid N800, 000 to an associate of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi nearly stalled the negotiation process.\n\nHe said the allegation angered Gumi and others helping to ensure the release of the students and they were not taking their calls.\n\nAccording to him, the woman was not part of the meeting with Gumi and wondered how she got such unfounded information.\n\nThe woman had said that the parents were taken to Gumi, who directed them to a Fulani man named Ahmed.\n\nShe said the parents paid N800, 000 to the man but the man said the money was for transportation and insisted that they should pay an additional N500 million.\n\nHowever, the source who said he was part of the negotiations, stated that the woman made her comments out of ignorance.\n\n\u201cThat woman made that unfortunate comment out of ignorance. It is just side talks. She was not at the meeting with Gumi; so, she didn\u2019t know what happened at the meeting. She just heard what some people are talking about at the corner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe parents of the 39 students later issued a statement dismissing the claims that they gave out N800, 000 to the Fulani man, who was recommended by Gumi.\n\nIn the statement issued in Kaduna, the parents said: \u201cThe claim has no basis.\u201d\n\nThe statement jointly signed Mr. Abdullahi Usman and Ms. Catherine Saleh, Chairman and Secretary respectively of the parents\u2019 union, also apologised to Gumi, \u201cfor any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement said though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, \u201cher claim is untrue,\u201d, as she was not a member of the (negotiation) committee representing the parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\u201d\n\nBuhari Excited\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari expressed happiness with the release of the students yesterday.\n\nHe also pleaded with the kidnappers to effect the release of the abducted students of Greenfield University also in Kaduna and other Nigerians being held in captivity.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, congratulated the released students\u2019 friends, families and the government and people of Kaduna State following the happy end to the saga.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are happy they have been released,\u201d while also expressing deep appreciation to all the actors who contributed one way or the other to the happy outcome, \u201cin particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State. We thank Nigerians for their prayers.\u201d\n\nHe called for steadfastness and security awareness on the part of citizens and the law enforcement agencies and deplored the increasing politicization of security in the country by opportunistic politicians.\n\nHe appealed for the release of the students of Greenfield University and all other citizens held in captivity, expressing the strong determination of his administration to ensure that Nigerians lived in a country where everyone can move where they want, when they want without the fear of kidnapping and banditry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Elumelu Calls for Urgent Power Sector Reforms to Boost Economy",
          "text": "\u2022Commends CBN on FX management\n\nBy Nume Ekeghe, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc Group Chairman and Founder, Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Mr. Tony Elumelu, has called for urgent reforms in the power sector to boost economic activities.\n\nElumelu, who is also the Chairman of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, also urged the federal government to invest more in electricity supply in order to create an avenue for innovation and economic development.\n\nHe spoke yesterday during an interview on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcasting arm of THISDAY Newspapers and lauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its foreign exchange management strategy as well as efforts to unify exchange rates.\n\nHe stressed the need for the federal government to focus on diversifying the economy in a bid to increase the country\u2019s forex inflow and reduce the dependence on oil revenue.\n\nAlso, responding to question on insider loan in companies he served as chairman, Elumelu stated that strict corporate governance are upheld in all the organisations.\n\nCommenting on the need for reforms in the power sector, he listed the three components of power supply as generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nHe said Nigerians would do better in business and creativity if they had steady electricity supply.\n\nHe decried the situation where inadequate electricity supply was crippling innovation and the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTranscorp through Transcorp Power and Afam Power today in Nigeria own the highest generating capacity in Nigeria that can generate 2,000 MW of electricity per day. But unfortunately, we do less than 500MW at this point in time and the major constraint in this area is gas; then there is the issue of transmission and there is the issue of payment.\n\n\u201cFor this to work well and for us to generate more, we need to have gas and our group has invested in oil and gas. And so, for us as a group, it is not necessarily for oil, it is because of gas because we want to be able to ensure that we have gas from our oil and gas production to convert to electricity.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition we did recently, I\u2019m happy to say, it is already supplying gas to our power plant. But going back to the subsidiary element, the issue of transmission, we need to make sure we stabilise our transmission for take-up.\u201d\n\nHe said Transcorp invested in the power sector to help Nigerians have access to electricity because businesses across all sectors of the economy like health, e-commerce, manufacturing, SMEs, among others, need power.\n\n\u201cThey cannot grow their businesses without adequate electricity.\n\nNigerian and African youths are multi-talented, but they need a steady electricity supply to be creative and innovative,\u201d he said.\n\nElumelu said if the government improves access to electricity in Nigeria, the Nigerian youths will create the Nigerian version of Silicon Valley and the likes of Steve Job and Bill Gates, explaining that what is holding Nigerian youths to a large extent is the lack of adequate electricity.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs at least 100,000 MW of electricity a day to power the economy but today we operate less than 5,000 MW and we need to do more,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGovernment, therefore, needs to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN and its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for the support given in the area of metering.\n\nHe said to drive the economy, power generation has to be increased by fixing the gas supply to generating companies, adding that there was the need to make sure that the transmission lines are utilised to evacuate the power as well as ensure that power generated is taken by Discos and the end-users and they pay.\n\nThe business mogul said: \u201cPower is still a critical sector; we need to invest and the stakeholders need to make sure that it works. And when it works, the country\u2019s economic development becomes more real.\n\n\u201cEvery sector of our economy needs the power sector and I think we need to prioritise it more. But I commend efforts going on and also by making sure we privatise the remaining ones. The transmission lines need to be fixed and we need to make sure we improve the payment system.\u201d\n\nHe advocated the privatisation of the entire value-chain of the power sector.\n\nElumelu stated: \u201cThe area of privatising the transmission lines, I think that ultimately, it should be privatised. What some of us have advocated is that the Gencos, the Discos and the entire power stakeholders should come together and have a deal with the federal government to take over the transmission lines and it would be in our self-interest to make sure it works.\n\n\u201cWe have the transmission lines and it doesn\u2019t work when you are generating, there is no way you would evacuate your power. That sector is so critical and pivotal for the survival of the power sector. It is critical to improving access to electricity, and where it is now there is no problem but what is important to us is that we have expanded capacity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the recent development at First Bank Nigeria Limited, Elumelu declined to make a comment.\n\nBut he said the decisions arrived at in resolving the board crisis in the bank were appropriate and beneficial to all major stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou need to understand the unique situation of this question. I am chairman of a competing institution and it may not be prudent for me to express a judgment or comment on this because it may not be very professional of me.\n\n\u201cBut I know the shareholders of the bank, and I also know the regulatory mindset, and the regulators want a safe banking environment and I believe the shareholders also seek that in due course, I believe they would be able to resolve the issues. I must say the banking sector has done very well, both the regulatory part and the participants.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on if UBA is exposed to insider trading and lending with his other businesses, he stated that his oil and gas interests were financed by a consortium of local and international banks, excluding UBA.\n\nIn addition, his other ventures have exposure below the threshold and the loans are serviced.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe oil and gas acquisition we just made, UBA did not participate in the funding. It is a club of international and local lenders. The local receiving bank for our proceeds is Union Bank of Nigeria and the international receiving bank of our oil sales is Standard Chartered Bank, London.\n\n\u201cThe transaction was funded by consortium of banks \u2013 Standard Chartered, ABSA IN South Africa, Afrexim, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank in Nigeria and a host of other international banks. So, we are mindful of all this and we are very prudent in making sure we do not put pressure on the bank.\n\n\u201cWe also put in equity investment and when we need to get investment, we try not to put pressure on the institution. What is important is that it is within the limit UBA should be exposed to a company and it is by the way performing very well. Our loans are performing very well.\u201d\n\nOn CBN forex management strategy, Elumelu said he supported efforts being made by the regulator to achieve convergence of rates.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo years ago, our vice president conveyed a meeting of a few of us to express our opinion and talk on the economy. The position then was quite critical at the time. But today, when things have improved, you should be also critical to say that things are moving in the right direction. On the convergence, I support it 100 per cent and I think we are there.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the saddle or seat you would see things more differently. For Nigeria, we generate foreign currency largely from oil. We used to produce around 2.5 million barrels before and today, we are doing 1.4 million barrels per day and that should have an impact on our foreign currency which is no rocket science.\n\n\u201cAlso, there was a time oil was $100 per barrel and it dropped to almost $40 per barrel and today it is at $69 per barrel. So, there is a basket of so many things we have to watch as economic managers in making decisions and there is a lot of pressure on our foreign currency.\n\n\u201cWhat people want to see from outside is a low exchange rate, but from the business world, people want to predict that this would be available and I think to a large extent, it is happening\n\nElumelu, who also spoke about the ease of doing business in Nigeria, said government must improve on its policy to attract more investors.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that investors, who are looking for where to invest their money, will go to countries where the policy on the ease of doing business is investor-friendly. The private sector must also work with government to ensure that the ease of doing business in Nigeria improves,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\nSpeaking on the impact of Tony Elumelu Foundation, Elumelu said it was established seven years ago to empower young Nigerians and Africans, stressing that the future of Africa remains in the hands of the youth who have key roles to play in developing Nigeria and the continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cI strongly feel it will be a waste of resources to save so much money in banks without using such money to empower people, especially when there is poverty among the masses. It is for this reason that we established Tony Elumelu Foundation to empower young people and make successful businesses out of them.\n\n\u201cEvery year, the foundation supports young people with a seed capital of $5,000 each, which is non-refundable and the foundation supports 1,000 people every year. We train them for 12 weeks and appoint business mentors for them and we create a networking platform for them to interact and grow their business ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the foundation gets support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union, stressing that the EU recently released $25 million.\n\nHe said the fund would be used for the next batch of trainees.\n\nElumelu stated that about 10, 000 Nigerians, including other Africans, have benefited from the training offered by the Tony Elumelu Foundation in the last seven years.\n\nOn the issue of girl-child education, Elumelu said there was a need to close the gap on gender inequality.\n\n\u201cI am a direct beneficiary of women\u2019s impact in molding the society, through the training I received from my mother, and cherish to support the girl-child education in order to bridge gender inequality,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nGiving details of his exit from UBA as managing director and chief executive officer, Elumelu said the orders came from the then CBN Governor, Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who felt that all bank CEOs that had served for 10 years, should step aside at that time.\n\n\u201cThat day, we had a Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting and at the end of the meeting, the then CBN Governor, Lamido Sanusi, told me that CEOs who had done 10 years will step aside. I called the chairman to explain what happened and the next day, we conveyed an emergency board meeting. At the board meeting, it was a divided household for the first time; some directors said \u2018no, we have to go to court to contest it\u2019 and about one or two other directors did not think so. But I spoke and I told the board members that there are five critical stakeholders here \u2013 the customers of UBA \u2013 will they like to know that we took our regulator to court? No, then the staff of UBA; will they be comfortable working in a bank that took their regulator to court? No, then the shareholders, then the regulators themselves, they wouldn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cSo, four constituents will not like us going to court.

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore. Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet.",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Canada or Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in Canada or Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and initially started off offering to-and-fro money transfers between Nigeria and Canada. Transfers to Kenya, Ghana, the US, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

Yes, Gozem just launched there this week.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Emeka Ajene and Raphael Dana, Gozem operates an app that offers transportation, logistics, e-commerce and financial services in primarily-francophone African countries.\n\nGozem is aiming to be the super app for Africa and is modelled after the success of Gojek and WeChat in Southeast Asia and China respectively. While it is only one of many super app candidates in Africa, geographic expansion is a signal of strong intent.\n\nUntil the rollout in Gabon, Gozem was only available in cities across Togo and Benin, offering motorcycle taxis, tricycle taxis, and delivery of groceries, gas bottles, and meals.\n\nThe company says it has more than 500,000 registered users who have completed more than 2.5 million trips since inception.\n\nGabon will be Gozem\u2019s first operation outside of West Africa. The Central African country\u2019s population is under 2.5 million with almost 75% under the age of 30.\n\nScreenshots of the Gozem app. Image source: Gozem.\n\nThe ride-hailing feature is the only service Gabonese users will find on the app at the moment and it is only available in Libreville, the capital city.\n\n\u201cOur immediate focus is on providing a high-quality, reliable taxi service in that city, and then expanding the range of services we offer to Libreville\u2019s population,\u201d Ajene, Gozem co-founder and CEO, said to TechCabal.\n\nLaunching a taxi service in Gabon helps the company \u201cdiversify away from our beginnings as a 100% motorcycle-taxi oriented platform.\u201d\n\nWith Libreville in the mix, Gozem now operates in 10 cities across West and Central Africa. Ajene notes that most are not capital cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed an in-house capability to operate effectively in secondary cities in the region and there are one or two additional cities that you might ultimately see Gozem operating in in Gabon,\u201d he said.\n\nOne point of curiosity in this expansion is that Gabon is a smaller country by population compared to Togo (~8 million) and Benin (~ 12 million). Ajene acknowledges that but explains that purchasing power is another consideration that bears on expansion plans.\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita,\u201d Ajene said.\n\nIndeed, Gabon\u2019s 2020 GDP per capita was estimated to be $7,185, more than thrice the sum of Benin\u2019s $1,259 and Togo\u2019s $690.\n\n\n\nGozem\u2019s ride-hailing offering will work in Gabon like a standard app-enabled taxi booking service. Users download, sign up and input their destination to request rides. Driver accepts and the fare is calculated by distance. Users can pay in cash, with Airtel Money or Moov Money, or by credit card.\n\nRaphael Dana, Gozem co-founder, says the launch responds to the needs of the Gabonese population and aligns with Gozem\u2019s long-term plan to organise transport and commerce in Africa around the ongoing smartphone and internet revolution.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to consolidate our status as the premier super app in Africa, and this expansion to Central Africa, our first foray outside of West Africa, also allows us to prepare our upcoming expansion to Cameroon,\u201d Dana said.\n\nThe expansion to Cameroon is on the calendar for this year; DR Congo is also being explored. Beyond moving into new countries to enable taxis however, Gozem plans to make its other verticals compete with incumbents in the markets they currently operate.\n\n\u201cWe have robust food & e-commerce delivery verticals, we\u2019re beginning to see a significant impact coming from our vehicle financing vertical as well, and our plans for our full-service wallet are still on track,\u201d Ajene said.",

One of their games, Carry1st Trivia, got a lot of buzz in 2020 with about one and a half million downloads.\n\nIn the three years since its launch, Carry1st has also become a medium for bringing mobile gaming from global companies to Africa. The Cape Town-based company realised that developers have had problems with distribution and payments in Africa.\n\nThey decided to solve that by embedding a fintech solution, Pay1st, on their platform. Pay1st features popular payment methods from six African countries, giving African gamers on Carry1st the ability to pay how they want.\n\nThe result is a company that is a publishing platform for games but also a full-stack management solution for game developers seeking user acquisition, marketing and monetization in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we were able to successfully sign 7 great titles, recruit a top-notch international team, and build out our payments and digital commerce platform,\u201d Robbin-Coker, CEO of Carry1st, said in a statement.\n\nRight to Left: Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu, Carry1st co-founders.

They have announced the close of a $6 million Series A round led by Konvoy Ventures, an early-stage VC firm based in the US State of Colorado. Carry1st joins a list of other gaming companies on Konvoy\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJackson Vaughan, Managing Partner at Konvoy Ventures, joins Carry1st\u2019s board as a result of the investment. He said Carry1st\u2019s advantage is in \u201capproaching sub-regions with contextual understanding.\u201d\n\nOther investors in the round include Riot Games (the company behind \u2018League of Legends\u2019), Raine Ventures, AET Fund / Akatsuki and TTV Capital.\n\nWith this round, Carry1st has now raised $9.5m since it was founded. The most recent funding round before this was in May 2020 when they raised $2.5million from a seed round led by CRE Venture Capital.\n\nCarry1st plans to enter new partnerships with global gaming studios. Their existing partnerships cut across continents: with Raketspel in Sweden, New York-based Cosi Games, and Ethiopian developer Qene Games.\n\nThey also intend to launch new games and scale existing ones. To achieve that, they plan to hire more staff for product, engineering, and growth. The strategy is welcome by their latest investors.\n\n\u201cAt Riot, we have seen first hand the importance of partnering with local experts to bring the best possible gaming experience to players,\u201d Brendan Mulligan, Head of Corporate Development at Riot Games, said.\n\n\u201cAs the number of gamers in Africa explodes, we\u2019re excited to work with Cordel and Carry1st as they introduce game developers from all over the world to an important and passionate audience.\u201d\n\nCarry1st could be an engine for driving the mobile gaming economy in Africa, tapping into a growing global wave.\n\n36% of all mobile app downloads in 2020 were mobile games, according to App Annie, the mobile apps analytics company. 70% of all app purchases on the Apple store and Google Play in 2020 was on games.\n\nThe upward trajectory in mobile game spend is set to continue this year, reaching $120 billion.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

As it were, its focus is currently on Francophone African markets.\n\nResidents of Libreville \u2014 Gabon\u2019s capital \u2014 can now access digital ride-hailing services on the Gozem app, as the service is not yet available outside the city.\n\nGozem\u2019s operations initially spanned only cities in the Republic of Benin and Togo \u2014 two West African countries. Both have a larger population than Gabon\u00b4s 2.5 million populace. Per TechCabal, the startup\u2019s CEO and Co-founder, Emeka Ajene, stated the reason for focusing on Gabon:\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ride-hailing service will carry out operations similar to Uber and Bolt. Charges will be based on the distance covered. Payment can be made with cash, credit cards, Airtel Money, or the Moove Money Fintech platform.\n\nSince its launch in 2018 and early beginnings in Togo as a motorcycle ride-hailing startup, Gozem has made its ambition to be Africa\u2019s no.1 super app very clear. Today, the app has diverse verticals in electronic transportation, food delivery, eCommerce, logistics, and financial services, with customers\u2019 needs the determinant of further expansion.\n\nGozem is not the first African-based startup with super app ambitions. Startups like OPay in Nigeria and CanGo in Central Africa began with similar aspirations.\n\nCanGo unexpectedly shut down in January 2020, while certain challenges peculiar to the Lagos State market proved to be a stumbling block to OPay, which dropped the ambition and focused on fintech.\n\nGozem\u2019s Central African launch proves it is as dogged today in the pursuit of its vision as it was when it started. Time will tell if it will record success as a super app.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAre you building a startup business within Port Harcourt but struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Shehu Garba, said that the aim of the workshop was to help the committee effectively discharge its duties.\n\nGarba who was represented by the deputy chairman, Rep. Bagos Dachung (PDP, Plateau) said that the importance of capacity building in human life cannot be over emphasised.\n\nHe said that it will broadens the knowledge and know-how of the participants and also will help in the institutional growth of the country and the world at large.\n\n\u201cWe all know the dynamics of corruption; hence we need to try every available means to tackle it, this capacity building for members on Anti\u2014Corruption is a crucial component of this 9th House of Representatives Legislative Agenda on Anti-Corruption.\n\n\u201cAt the inaugural meeting of the Committee, an ad-hoc Committee was set up to design a work plan to assist her in the discharge of her mandate, and one of the proposal from the ad hoc committee was to collaborate and seek support from organisations of like minds in order to tackle the menace anti-corruption.\n\n\u201cWe all know the crucial role the parliament has to play in the fight against corruption and to be able to do so, she needs not only to be well informed, but also to be well armed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAlso, Prof. Suleiman Abubakar, the Director-General of National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies, stressed the need for a change of narrative by the legislature.\n\nAccording to him, there was the need to change the narrative that the parliament aims to undermine the strength of anti-graft agencies.\n\n\u201cThe legislature is doing so much to assist the anti-graft agencies in achieving their mandate through oversight activities and other processes of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt rests on those agencies to work well with the national Assembly by ensuring that those procedures are carried out appropriately and Legislature performs its role, especially in oversight which is key and cumbersome.\n\n\u201cNot only by cooperating but also canvassing for the National Assembly to get all the support it needs and requires to perform its duties,\u2019\u2019 Suleiman said.",

Hon. Bello Masari, said that the state had suffered a setback in agriculture as over sixty thousand hectares of farmlands were uncultivated due to insurgency, which hindered farmers from gaining access to their means of livelihood.\n\nThe Governor of Kebbi state Senotor Atiku Abubakar Bagudu who represented President Muhammadu Buhari while unveiling the pyramids, reassured the farmers, processors and other value chain participants, of the support of government towards ensuring that they perform optimally.\n\nHence, he said availability of inputs like high yield seedlings and fertilizers were being made available to farmers adequately in addition to prompt off-taking of produce.",

          "text": "By Titus Akhigbe, Benin\n\nThe Edo State government on Thursday said over N3billion, under the World Bank intervention programme, has been budgeted to support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises that were affected by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBriefing journalists in Benin City, Joel Edionwe, Permanent Secretary, Edo State ministry of wealth creation, cooperatives and employment, said the recovery and economic stimulus programme is targeted at cushioning the effects of COVID-19 on businesses.\n\nEdionwe said the money, which is part of the $750million loan intervention program for the 36 states of the federation, would span from 2021 to 2022.\n\nAccording to him, the pandemic created a lot of dislocation, there were lockdowns, some businesses were not able to run and those who borrowed money from financial institutions were not able to do business. So, many of them could not pay.\n\nWhile noting that the programme is open to all Edo citizens, the permanent secretary disclosed that they have recruited and trained agents who will go round the entire wards across the 18 Local Government Areas to ensure data and businesses are captured into the system.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (N-CARES) program is an intervention programme between the world bank and Nigeria, and by extension Edo State government.\n\n\u201cFor the entire program in Nigeria, it is $750million. For this program, which is Result Area-3 (R3), the budget is over N3billion that is attached to it in Edo State. For food security, agriculture there are also support for them.\n\n\u201cThe programme covers various aspects. Broadly, there are three areas of it, some address livelihood issues, some targeted at food security but the one for which we are here for is called Result Area-3 (R3) intervention to support Small and Medium-scale Enterprises recovery and economic stimulus programme,\u201d Edionwe said.\n\nHe further categorized the programme into three Disbursement Linked Initiative(DLI), namely, grant to support post COVID-19 loan, support for SMEs to cushion operational cost, and grants to enhance technical capabilities and development of digital capacities.\n\n\u201cThe first DLI is designed to give 40 percent loan recovery assistance to these enterprises.\n\nThose who had some of these loans running and couldn\u2019t pay back due to COVID-19, these programme will support them up to 40 percent to ensure repayment.\n\n\u201cThe mode of disbursement is not done by the ministry. This programme is running in partnership with the Bank of Industry, and the platform to be adopted is owned by the BOI.\n\nWhatever data we are going to collate will be forwarded to the BOI, who will then do due diligence to ensure that all applications are treated with merit and in line with the guidelines.\n\n\u201cThe initial fund to enable this program run will be provided by the Edo State government, and the governor has given his guaranty.\n\nWe have started the funding program by addressing preliminary and preparatory matters.\n\n\u201cThe programme is operating on a framework called Performance for Result(P for R). What the world bank does is to allow us run this program, do an independent verification to actually ascertain the result.\n\nIf the results are confirmed, then the world bank comes back to reimburse the money that the state government spent on this program\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "Lawmakers have been notified of a possible attack by Boko Haram insurgents on the National Assembly complex and other public buildings in Abuja.\n\nSeveral members of the House of Representatives, on Wednesday, confirmed that they had been notified of the imminent attack by the terrorist group.\n\nOne of them, who is from a state in the South-West, said his presence would henceforth be limited on the premises.\n\n\u201cThat is the security alert I saw today. I\u2019m already moving out of here. I\u2019ll only be around when there is a major reason to do so. Nowhere is safe in the country anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nAlready the notice on the impending attack has been made available to the lawmakers.\n\nThe notice, a copy of which our correspondent obtained, was sent to the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, other principal officers and all members of the House.\n\nThe \u2018security alert\u2019, dated May 4, 2021, was issued by Chairman of the House Committee on Internal Security, National Assembly, Mr Usman Shiddi.\n\nIt was titled \u2018Re: planned insurgent attacks on VIP locations, government facilities and assets in Abuja.\u2019\n\nThe alert read, \u201cI refer to the above subject of which a copy of the intelligence report from the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigeria Police Force in the National Assembly Complex has been made available to my office.\n\n\u201cThe report indicates planned insurgent attacks by some elements of Boko Haram on some VIP locations, government facilities and assets in Abuja, including the National Assembly complex.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above intelligence, I have considered it paramount to advise that all members should, henceforth, use the presidential gate for ingress and egress.\n\n\u201cThis is to avoid the unforeseen congestions that are sometimes encountered at the main gates, since such congestions could easily be the targets for these insurgent elements.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies are, however, actively on top of the issue to unravel and to contain the intended menace. Accept the assurances of my highest regards, please.\u201d\n\nSecurity has been beefed up in and around the complex since Thursday last week.\n\nFor the first time, security operatives on that day checked vehicles entering the premises, causing traffic congestion especially at the third (and last) gate, a process that has continued till date.\n\nBefore now, the security operatives were only after the identities of drivers and passengers to confirm that they were staff members, legislative aides, journalists or persons working in private businesses in the complex.\n\nIt\u2019s observed that soldiers joined the regular sergeants-at-arms and men of the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Services, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Federal Road Safety Corps that manned the gates.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Business, House of Representatives, Abubakar Fulata, confirmed the development in plenary.\n\nThe Speaker called on Chairman of the House Committee on Treaties, Protocols and Agreements, Nicholas Ossia, to lay the report on the \u2018Bill for an Act to Repeal Treaties (Making Procedure, Etc.) Act, Cap. T20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and Enact Treaties (Making Procedure) Bill.\u2019\n\nFulata, however, notified the Speaker that Ossai was not in the chamber, saying several lawmakers were still stuck in the traffic because of the security checks.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult today to get in, so a lot of members are stranded at the gate because of the very serious check-in process that the security men are conducting. A lot of members are there stranded at the gate,\u201d Fulata said.\n\nGbajabiamila had asked, \u201cFor what reason? Stranded for what?\u201d\n\nFulata had said, \u201cThis morning, it is very difficult to come in. It has been very difficult to come in today. They are doing security checks.\u201d\n\nRecall that the Governor of Niger State, Sani Bello, had on April 26, 2021, raised the alarm over Boko Haram terrorists taking over a part of the state, hoisting their flag in Kaure village from where they had made incursions into more than 50 villages.\n\nBello said Abuja was not safe, with Boko Haram\u2019s presence in Kaure \u2013 a two- hour journey from the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements here in Niger State. Here in Kaure, I am confirming that they have hoisted their flags here.\u201d\n\nSame day, Gbajabiamila, had met with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, in company with the Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa.\n\nThe House the next day held a long executive (closed-door) session to discuss the rising spate of insecurity across Nigeria, calling on Buhari to declare a state of emergency on security.\n\nAt the secret session that lasted over three hours, the lawmakers unanimously adopted a series of resolutions, one of which was that \u201cthe Federal Government should ensure the protection of national infrastructure and assets, particularly the Shiroro and Kainji Dams in Niger State.\u201d",

          "text": "Fr Ejike Mbaka, Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministries Enugu, has been suspended by the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Catholic Diocese of Enugu suspended Mbaka from church activities for a month over his political antics, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nAfter being summoned by Callistus Valentine Onaga, the diocesan bishop, Mbaka was requested to proceed on suspension with effect from May 3.\n\nFollowing his frequent clashes with President Muhammadu Buhari, Onaga called Mbaka and warned him that his actions were tarnishing the church\u2019s reputation, which is the largest of any Christian organization in the world, according to church officials familiar with the matter.\n\nMbaka chastised the Buhari-led government on Wednesday for its inaction in the face of widespread killings across the country.\n\nMbaka\u2019s suspension has been traced by many Nigerians to criticism that the church was already partisan.\n\nMbaka, according to some social media users, should have been praised for speaking out against poor governance.\n\nA tweep, @lucasuzoka wrote, \u201cWhat a shame! The Catholic church is not even a church that can stand the taste of time, just imagine you suspend someone for saying the truth. Catholic faithful should even suspend the Catholic church from Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user, @inspiredson, said Mbaka had once criticised former President Goodluck Jonathan and was not suspended.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cI recall that he criticised GEJ, a Christian, over insecurity even alleging an attempt on his life, yet he was not suspended. But when he criticises PMB, a Muslim, on the same insecurity issue, he gets suspended. Outright double standard and cowardice of Catholic leadership.\u201d\n\n@BarrROUN1990 said, \u201cWhile Gumi and Pantami, being terrorism suspects, are unpunishable, Mbaka has been suspended for committing no crime. After losing several priests & Christians to insecurity, calling for Buhari\u2019s resignation was proper & in tune with Nigeria\u2019s current situation.\u201d\n\nAnother user, @midasnonso, opined, \u201cFr. Mbaka said all he said during GEJ\u2019s reign and enjoyed freedom. Only his first fallout with this government, his robe has been taken away. We should be mindful of the evil we admit in the form of support.\u201d\n\n@F_Matesclothing suggested, \u201cThis issue can be handled better. Send him on a mission to an African country for a year, suspending him is calling for a confrontation or split between lay faithful and his lordship.\u201d\n\n@NoahNwosu75 tweeted: \u201cThe core North across the political divide including govt supported #IsaPantami but here Catholic diocese of Enugu is hanging out Mbaka to dry for being courageous enough to criticise Buhari incompetence & discrimination against the South. Let this not be true, Enugu Catholic diocese.\u201d\n\n@iam_foleymessi wrote, \u201cThey did not suspend Ejike Mbaka when he supported Buhari but can now suspend him for being against Buhari. Now I know why most church leaders are not speaking against this government. They are either in support or scared.\u201d\n\n@khrisempress, \u201cThe catholic church did not suspend Mbaka when it was needed, it is now that he is talking against this government that they decided to carry out this suspension. Make it make sense please.\u201d\n\nThe church has yet to make an official statement on the suspension of the controversial cleric.\n\nSome sources in the church had said Mbaka\u2019s latest suspension was being viewed as significant for its undertone, but not the first time the fiery priest would face administrative action.\n\n\u201cWe know people will link this to his confrontation with Buhari, but he was once demoted from a parish priest to a deputy under a parish priest,\u201d a church official told TheGazette.\n\n\u201cHe had also been transferred from bigger parishes to smaller ones for his frequent infractions in the past.\u201d",

It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies were in full alignment with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security, and anti-corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Digital Economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 percent double-digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, the ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 percent. This is truly commendable,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the digital economy sector provided online options for activities that were hitherto restricted to offline channels while minimizing the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe added that the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government embraced institutionalizing online meetings through the approval of the National Policy on Virtual Engagements in Federal Public Institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements, and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the Policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past: \u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe assured that his administration was fully committed to the safety of Nigerians and linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid in national planning and budget preparations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy appreciated the President for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nThe minister noted that the NIN Registration had recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, adding, \u201cwithin six months over 12 million enrolled.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr Pantami said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that can be used in various transactions, assuring that the NIN and Sim card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 percent.\n\nHe said the buoyancy of the telecoms sector had given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health, and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world-class sim card manufacturing company in the country.",
          "summary": "He said \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure.\n\u201cThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was quite timely and will support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\u201cThe Digital Economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\nPresident Buhari said the digital economy sector provided online options for activities that were hitherto restricted to offline channels while minimizing the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\u201cThe Federal Government embraced institutionalizing online meetings through the approval of the National Policy on Virtual Engagements in Federal Public Institutions.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s federal government has replaced the head of the interim administration of Tigray, a region racked by more than six months of catastrophic conflict.\n\nMulu Nega had held the position since November, shortly after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military campaign against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), the northern region\u2019s ruling party that had dominated national politics for decades.\n\nMulu was replaced by Abraham Belay, who had been serving as minister of innovation and technology in the federal government, Abiy\u2019s office said in a Twitter post on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe appointment is a result of a six-month performance review of the role,\u201d Abiy\u2019s spokeswoman Billene Seyoum said. Abraham is a member of Abiy\u2019s Prosperity Party.\n\nAbiy said on November 4 he was sending troops into Tigray after accusing the TPLF of orchestrating attacks on federal army camps. The TPLF, which was at the helm of Ethiopia\u2019s governing coalition for nearly 30 years until Abiy took office in 2018, denied responsibility and said the reported attack was a pretext for an \u201cinvasion\u201d by federal forces and allied troops from neighbouring Eritrea.\n\nAfter federal troops took the regional capital Mekelle in November, Mulu set about trying to establish an interim government even as fighting raged elsewhere in the region.\n\nIn an interview in February, he said he knew Mekelle residents had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about his presence in the office formerly occupied by their overthrown leaders.\n\nHe said he was happy in the job but did not want to stay on for long, and that he was planning to leave after elections are held in Tigray. The region will not take part in national elections planned for June 5 and it is unclear when voting will happen there.\n\nThe conflict is believed to have killed thousands of people, if not more and displaced more than one million, including some 60,000 who fled to neighbouring Sudan.\n\nIncreasing reports of mass killings, rape and widespread hunger have prompted international alarm and pressing calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops, who have been implicated in some of the worst attacks on civilians documented so far, including brutal gang rapes. Eritrea denies involvement in atrocities.\n\nOver the weekend, Abiy\u2019s Council of Ministers approved a resolution classifying the TPLF as a \u201cterrorist\u201d group, dealing a blow to the prospect of peace talks.",
          "summary": "Ethiopia\u2019s federal government has replaced the head of the interim administration of Tigray, a region racked by more than six months of catastrophic conflict.\nMulu was replaced by Abraham Belay, who had been serving as minister of innovation and technology in the federal government, Abiy\u2019s office said in a Twitter post on Thursday.\n\u201cThe appointment is a result of a six-month performance review of the role,\u201d Abiy\u2019s spokeswoman Billene Seyoum said.\nAbiy said on November 4 he was sending troops into Tigray after accusing the TPLF of orchestrating attacks on federal army camps.\nAfter federal troops took the regional capital Mekelle in November, Mulu set about trying to establish an interim government even as fighting raged elsewhere in the region.",

          "text": "A former Ugandan child solider who became a commander in a notorious rebel group has been jailed for war crimes.\n\nDominic Ongwen, now 45, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for crimes including murder, rape and torture.\n\nHe is the first former Ugandan child solider to be convicted and sentenced by the International Criminal Court.\n\nOngwen was abducted by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group when he was nine years old and eventually became a feared commander.\n\nHe was convicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in February on 61 of 70 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nThe crimes relate to attacks on four camps for internally displaced people in Uganda in 2004. More than 4,000 victims provided testimony in the case, which was heard in The Hague.\n\nOngwen was found guilty of sexual slavery, forced marriage and the rape of seven women who were abducted and placed into his household. These charges were in addition to murder, attempted murder and torture.\n\nAt the height of his time with the LRA, Ongwen \u2013 known as White Ant because his surname means \u201cborn at the time of the white ant\u201d \u2013 was the commander of the Sinia brigade and one of the most feared fighters in the rebel movement.\n\nHe turned himself in to US forces in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2015 \u2013 and they later handed him over to the Ugandan army.\n\nThe LRA was formed more than 30 years ago, operating in Uganda and neighbouring countries.\n\nLed by Joseph Kony, it became notorious for abducting thousands of children to use as soldiers or sex slaves, and for mutilating civilians.\n\nIn 2005, the LRA was forced out of Uganda by the army and the rebels went into what is now South Sudan. They eventually set-up camp in the border area with the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThey later moved to CAR where they acted more like a criminal outfit engaging in poaching and illegal mining.",

          "text": "A Chinese rocket, thought to be out of control, is set to crash back to Earth this weekend.\n\nSpace agencies are tracking debris from the Long March 5B, which last week launched the main module of China\u2019s first permanent space station into orbit. The roughly 100ft long stage, said to be the size of five buildings, would be among the biggest space debris to fall to Earth.\n\nExperts expect it to fall to Earth on Saturday buts ay it is impossible to know where exactly it will land as its speed makes it too unpredictable.\n\nChina\u2019s space agency has yet to say whether the rocket is being controlled or will make an out-of-control descent. But the Global Times newspaper, published by the Chinese Communist party, has claimed the rocket\u2019s \u201cthin-skinned\u201d aluminium-alloy exterior will easily burn up in the atmosphere, posing an extremely remote risk to people.\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University, said that the debris is most likely to fall in the ocean as that\u2019s what makes up most of Earth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people should take precautions. The risk that there will be some damage or that it would hit someone is pretty small \u2014 not negligible, it could happen \u2014 but the risk that it will hit you is incredibly tiny.\n\nThere is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area, as in May 2020, when pieces from another Chinese Long March 5B rocket rained down on the Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings, though no injuries were reported, McDowell said.\n\n\u201cAnd so I would not lose one second of sleep over this on a personal threat basis,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cThere are much bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s first space station, Tiangong-1, crashed into the Pacific in 2016 after Beijing confirmed it had lost control. In 2019 the space agency controlled the demolition of its second station, Tiangong-2, in the atmosphere.\n\nIn March debris from a Falcon 9 rocket launched by US company SpaceX fell to Earth in Washington and on the Oregon coast.",
