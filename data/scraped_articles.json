To me, you don\u2019t just say restructuring, we need to have a national dialogue first.\n\n\u201cI know that we have one during the time of former President, Goodluck Jonathan, but, where is the report, the book is gathering dust.\n\n\u201cTo me, I will tell you that there are a lot of benefits if we are together.\u201d\n\nAdegoke, while speaking further, maintained that Nigeria is currently experiencing many problems because we are not operating federal system of government the way it supposed to be.\n\n\u201cThe problem in Nigeria is that we are not actually implementing the federal system of government very well. We are not following it.\n\n\u201cIt is unitary system that we are operating. You say that we are running a federal system of government but, states are not in control of resources in thier states.\n\n\u201cThat is not how it should be. States will be going to Abuja every month to collect allocation. That is the problem, because states will become lazy because they know that they will collect money in Abuja at the end of the month.\u201d",

          "title": "How to win the war on insecurity",
          "text": "By Chidozie Acholonu\n\nSIR: Across Nigeria, the recurring commentary has been the concerns over terror and insecurity perpetrated by non-state violent groups. In the northeast, the Boko Haram and affiliated jihadists are waging a high-level insurgency that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions; gangs of gunmen called, \u2018bandits,\u2019 are killing and kidnapping hundreds of civilians and children in Northwest. And in the North-central, Southwest and Northwest killer herdsmen are running amok on a killing and kidnapping spree. Then in the Southeast and South-south unknown gunmen, suspected to be from the Eastern Security Network or ESN (from the Indigenous People of Biafra), are brazenly attacking security installations and killing law enforcement and military personnel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo the question then is, can Nigeria win the war on insecurity against violent armed groups that skillfully exploit our security gaps and divisions as a country? And the answer is yes we can, if, we adopt a \u201cGrand Strategy.\u201d\n\nPeter Layton defined Grand strategy as \u201cthe art of developing and applying diverse forms of power in an effective and efficient way to try to purposefully change the relationship existing between two or more intelligent and adaptive entities. Grand strategy is now a distinctive, stand-alone expression. Grand strategy can no longer be confused or conflated with others such as statecraft, foreign policy, or even strategy.\u201d\n\nIn adopting a grand strategy, Nigeria must first clearly define its objectives for winning against the adversaries being fought. This means that a one size fits all cannot be applied against the different groups Nigeria is fighting. To succeed, the Nigerian government needs to understand the adversaries, their principal weaknesses and their strengths in relation to its strengths and weaknesses. This will require Nigeria to quickly conducting a nationwide threat assessment, to determine the overall threat landscape, root causes, the actors, weaknesses, gaps, strengths of the adversaries and Nigeria, as well as remedies moving forward.\n\nSecond, the Nigerian government must adopt a comprehensive whole-of-nation approach to counter the activities, change the narratives from their adversaries and win the hearts and minds of the people. This requires mobilizing all the influential and respected people in the country, across the ethnic groups, to work with the federal and state governments to proffer inclusive solutions, including amending the constitution to create state constitutions. Targeting development activity to the most vulnerable groups and communities, irrespective of ethnicity. Maintaining schemes that address poverty, a prominent example being the Covid-19 cash schemes and agriculture schemes. These measures are very popular and must be done as a matter of time and urgency.\n\nThe third part of the grand strategy involves allocating a higher percentage of GDP to defence and security by increasing the armed forces and law enforcement budget. Increasing the security and defence budget will allow the Nigerian Army, in particular, to expand from 100,000 to 500,000, while the police can expand from 350,000 to one million, with the right recruitment drive and investment.\n\nThe capacity of the country to counter internal security threats can also be increased, by developing state guards (vigilantes), manned by trained armed villagers to reinforce the security forces with their numbers. To sustain the manpower required, significant investment in resources must be made to increase the salary, welfare, healthcare and housing needs of the recruits. The government would also need to appoint an independent watchdog with subpoena and sanction power to oversee the budget expenditure to avoid corruption. These measures would significantly boost the morale and patriotism of the nation fighting men and women.\n\nThe grand strategy will allow the Nigerian government to maximize its strengths and take back the initiative. In short to make the job on no state actors as hazardous and as unattractive as possible while returning strategic advantage to the government. Indeed Nigeria is confronted with a stark reality and to succeed Nigerians must be clear-eyed that the grand strategy will require great sacrifices today to win tomorrow.",

          "title": "World Press Freedom Day: When journalism is threatened, democracy is at stake",
          "text": "By Antonio Zappulla\n\nIt\u2019s one full year since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has since claimed millions of victims and changed the way in which we live our lives forever. And although some of the immediate consequences of the pandemic have been starkly evident, others have remained less apparent \u2014 despite the severity of their consequences. The erosion of media freedom and the decline of independent journalism around the world are among them.\n\nIn a defining paradox of our time, Covid-19 has simultaneously driven an acute need for accurate information and a thirst for trusted news while dismantling the very ecosystem that supplies it.\n\nThis year\u2019s World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders demonstrates that efforts to control the narrative around the pandemic has led to journalism being blocked in 73% of the 180 countries evaluated \u2014 with journalists\u2019 safety threatened and their reporting censored.\n\nThis grave deterioration in press freedom is set against the death knell for traditional media business models. The pandemic has forced news organisations to adapt to additional changes to news consumption, while facing the dire economic repercussions created by a drop in revenues. Recent estimates suggest newspapers alone will shed $30-billion this year, and an estimated $63.4-billion was wiped off advertising revenues globally in 2020, threatening the long-term financial sustainability of many news outlets.\n\nThis has put news media outlets\u2019 economic sustainability in jeopardy, and their editorial independence at risk. Independent news outlets are vulnerable not only to state control by autocratic regimes, but also at the mercy of advertisers or individuals interested in controlling their output.\n\nMeanwhile, news consumers continue to move online. Social media platforms are used on average by 31% of news consumers around the world, with 72% of those surveyed for the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism\u2019s Digital News Report consuming news through means other than a specific news website or app.\n\nBut the proliferation of digital platforms has also super-charged the spread of mis- and disinformation, from rumour and conspiracy theories about the vaccine rollout, to misinformation for political gain. As a result, readers\u2019 trust in news is now at a historic low. According to the 2021 Edelman Trust Barometer, 59% of consumers in 28 countries believe journalists are deliberately misleading them.\n\nFree and independent media are fighting the battle of their lives, but for some, their defences are weak. So, how can we all play our part, and prevent what philanthropic organisation Luminate has bleakly defined a media \u201cextinction event\u201d?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOur roadmap to recovery should be co-ordinated. It should take lessons from those leading the way in efforts to strengthen the economic sustainability of the media ecosystem post-Covid, while seizing opportunities created by emerging trends.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the crisis has driven a surge in demand for trusted, high-quality and original journalism. By September last year, The New York Times had reported a 45.9% increase in digital news subscribers. This is the first time that its online subscriptions have generated more revenue than print sales. La Nacion in Argentina is another example of such success. The paper has seen a 35% increase in digital news subscriptions this past year.\n\nThere have been significant increases in payment for online news countrywide in both the US and Norway, with smaller rises elsewhere, including the UK. The proportion of those who say they would be willing to pay for quality journalism in the future is also increasing, although currently only 16% do so.\n\nGlobally, quality journalism is increasingly seen as something worth paying for, albeit firmly confined to certain countries, certain demographics and certain media.\n\nThen there has been an encouraging new wave of government support for journalism during this crisis, from Canada\u2019s emergency financial relief for publications to Singapore\u2019s new fund for the media sector. Norway too introduced an aid package for media to help to recoup some of the losses incurred by Covid. Increased scrutiny on an ailing industry is fuelling a greater appetite for public policy solutions and government intervention without state control.\n\nElsewhere, efforts are being stepped up to defend public service media. The newly established International Fund for Public Interest Media is an ambitious project that aims to bolster financial support for media in low and middle-income countries through an independent, multilateral body. Decisions on which media outlets secure funding will be made at a regional level. The fund aims to secure $100-million by 2022. Meanwhile, the UK government\u2019s decision not to move ahead with its plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC\u2019s licence fee has saved the public service broadcaster an estimated $1-billion over five years.\n\nPhilanthropic support for journalism has also increased, with emergency funds and grants established during the Covid crisis. In the midst of the pandemic last year, intervention by a consortium of philanthropists and impact investors saved Australia\u2019s AAP newswire from closing, and the Guardian raised $9-million through readers\u2019 donations.\n\nPhilanthropists such as Pierre Omidyar, Craig Newman and George Soros are some of the leading names who have continued to channel vital support to independent journalism. This trend is also growing, with benefactors increasingly seeing the need to protect unbiased, high-quality journalism for the benefit of civil society.\n\nPerhaps, though, the most effective methods of securing the future of independent journalism might come from the transformation of news outlets themselves and their relationship with Big Tech.\n\nChanging the dynamic with Big Tech is no easy feat, but Australia\u2019s new legislation is paving the way for somewhat redressing the imbalance between powerful platforms and public interest news organisations. The news media bargaining code will see tech giants paying Australian media companies an estimated $600-million a year for the content they generate, with an independent arbiter stepping in if they cannot agree on payment among themselves. This follows the launch of the Facebook News service in the UK earlier this year and the US last year. The service is set to scale to Germany, France, India and Brazil.\n\nMeanwhile, Google has promised $1-billion in licensing fees to its partner news publishers around the world as part of its Google News showcase initiative. Staving off regulation might well be a motivating factor here, but if it is successful and scaled to include smaller news outlets as well as the leading ones \u2014 while also driving traffic to publishers\u2019 news sites and apps \u2014 this could be transformative for the industry.\n\nFinally, the Covid crisis has accelerated innovation in the drive to transform business models, from more publishers charging for content through donations, memberships, paywalls or subscriptions, to diversifying revenue streams through, for example, online events. These investments are costly, but outlets relying on hybrid business models \u2014 such as Rappler in the Philippines \u2014 appear to be in a stronger position.\n\nMeanwhile, in countries where independent journalism is most under threat, support from organisations committed to preserving and protecting media freedom is critical. At the Thomson Reuters Foundation, strengthening local and national journalism is key to our work in building free, fair and informed societies. Our vital support to independent media outlets to enhance their distribution and their financial models, while improving the quality of their journalism and their understanding of their audience, has never been more needed.\n\nIndependent journalism is a public good and protecting its future should be a shared goal. This past year has taught us that we can only succeed in defending it through a coherent and co-ordinated combination of responses. The time to act is now, because when the future of independent, pluralistic and accessible journalism is threatened, democracy itself is at stake.",

          "title": "Appraising Sanwo-Olu\u2019s poverty alleviation initiatives",
          "text": "By Mobolaji Adebayo\n\nIn view of the harsh reality of the havoc that poverty, if allowed to flourish, could unleash on the world that Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, has made poverty eradication a foremost goal of his administration\u2019s \u2018Greater Lagos\u2019 blueprint.\n\nLagos, being the country\u2019s economic, industrial and commercial hub, could experience untoward social-economic consequences if Nigeria\u2019s poverty and unemployment situation is not frontally addressed.\n\nSince Lagos State is home to about 21million Nigerians, it is safe to affirm that the state, which is the fifth largest economy in Africa, feels the brunt of the menace of youth employment the most. That Lagos alone accounts for over 70% of national industrial investments makes it attractive to job seekers from all across the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is in realisation of this that the Sanwo-Olu administration made \u2018Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy\u2019 a leading part of its T.H.E.M.E.S (acronyms for Traffic Management and Transportation, Health and Environment, Education and Technology, Making Lagos a 21ST Economy, Entertainment and Tourism and Governance and Security) developmental agenda.\n\nAn integral part of this is the evolution of several initiatives aimed at empowering the residents. The various initiatives are conceived, coordinated and implemented by agencies such as the Ministries of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (WAPA), Wealth Creation and Employment, Education, Agriculture, Youth and Social Development, Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Office of Civic Engagement, Office of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) among others.\n\nIn the last two years, about 48,000 households have been rescued from poverty through WAPA\u2019s various social intervention programmes under which women got cash transfers and acquired skills. Some 1,050 rural women received intensive training in boosting outputs in agricultural production and giving the beneficiaries equal access to markets. Largely, the government has prioritised intervention programmes that support women in achieving gender equality, self-reliance, skill balance, inclusion in social security systems and stable means of livelihood.\n\nThe government supported 2,704 Lagos residents whose means of livelihood had been disrupted by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 500 women were also assisted with N20,000 each through grants from the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs\u2019 to rural women.\n\nSeries of programmes and activities aimed at improving the status of women in Lagos and making them economically independent were also organised by the government. Also, in order to increase the total GDP for income generation, financial growth and stability, the government embarked on supporting women through direct cash intervention and capacity building.\n\nOver 48,000 women, from different households, have directly benefited from the government\u2019s mega empowerment project. Over 1,050 women have also profited from the state\u2019s agricultural training for rural women on cultivation of vegetables, cassava planting and cultivation, garri processing and other arable crops. Similarly, 250 women were empowered through an empowerment workshop on intercrop of maize and cassava with demonstration plots for practical knowledge.\n\nThe state\u2019s empowerment strategy also has a skill acquisition dimension for those who want to acquire vocations such as textile design, hair dressing, barbing, cosmetology, photography, shoe and leatherworks, fashion design, tiling, interior decoration, and Ankara craft among others.\n\nThis is done in the state\u2019s over 28 Skill Acquisition Centres, where over 25,000 Lagosians have acquired diverse skills. In 2019, Mr. Governor supported 18 outstanding students with N100,000 each to boost their morale. In the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, students across the skill acquisition centres produced 500,000 face masks for public use.\n\nEfforts are constantly made to develop the skills of graduates of the centres. Recently, 2,000 tradesmen and artisans were reskilled through the re-skilling programme developed to equip them towards becoming 21st-century compliant.\n\nIn order to sustain the momentum, eight vocational centres are at their completion stages, including skill acquisition, garri processing, cold room, market stall and community hall in Ibeshe Town, Amuwo Odofin, and a home for survivors of domestic violence.\n\nWidows and other vulnerable women are equally not left out in the state\u2019s empowerment scheme, as they have been empowered with working tools such as sewing machines, hairdryers and clippers, pepper grinding machines, generators and popcorn making machines. Similarly, 200 orphans and vulnerable children were empowered with 76 grinding machines, 69 sewing machines, 10 tools, 10 deep freezers, 15 hair-drying machines, 10 braving equipment and seven ovens among others.\n\nIn Lagos, unemployed youths fall into various categories viz employable and unemployable degree holders, medium level education certificate holders, school certificate holders and drop outs and those who never made it beyond primary schools.\n\nCheerfully, the various interventions of the government take cognisance of this categorization. For instance, to prepare graduates for life after school, the Ready-Set-Work was launched. It is an entrepreneurial and employability training programme aimed at ensuring that every student who graduates from any tertiary institution in Lagos has knowledge, skills, and attitude required to gain employment upon graduation. Thousands of graduates have been empowered from the scheme.\n\nSimilarly, the CodeLagos scheme, aimed at making coding education and technology accessible to Lagosians, principally targets the youth, and it holds across the six educational districts of the state with a total of 611 facilitators and over 27,000 participants.\n\nFor young residents with ingenious business ideas, the LSETF comes handy with its three in one programme. It comprises access to quick and affordable loans for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to start up, build, expand and create wealth and employment for the residents. From 2019 till date, over 15,000 residents have been empowered through the Fund.\n\nThe government\u2019s efforts at empowering MSMEs operatives are paying off. The state was declared as the \u2018Best State Supporting Artisans\u2019 in the federation at a programme organized by Global Sight Services Limited in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment and the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises of Nigerian [SMEDAN].\n\nIn order to expand its scope, the Sanwo-Olu administration launched the LSETF \u201cW\u201d Initiative to help women birth their entrepreneurial dreams into reality. The governor presented cheques to over 2,500 female beneficiaries of the \u2018W\u2019 initiative. In partnership with Access Bank, up to N5 million can be obtained through the initiative, which allows more women to come into the financial inclusion net and improve their businesses.\n\nSimilarly, in a bid to help businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a N5 billion \u201cLagos Economic Acceleration Programme (LSETF-LEAP)\u201d was unveiled. The LSETF-LEAP is a sector-specific intervention programme aimed at supporting MSMEs businesses, driving growth and enabling job creation opportunities across targeted sectors that have been severely affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe programme will provide access to affordable finance at a single-digit interest rate; enhance capacity building, foster market linkages and leverage business expansion opportunities for its beneficiaries.\n\nThough the task of tackling poverty and unemployment might seem herculean, the Sanwo-Olu administration has demonstrated, through its numerous creative initiatives that with the required will both monsters could be overcome. With a comatose global economy and a frightening unemployment statistics, we cannot afford to take the issue of wealth creation lightly. Therefore, all stakeholders must join hands with the government to come up with more ingenious means of wealth creation.",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Tony Akowe, Frank Ikpefan, Abuja; Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin, Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt, and Okungbowa Aiwerie, Asaba\n\nA huge division broke in the country yesterday over the call for restructuring and an urgent national dialogue by South\u2019s governors to fashion a way out of the worsening insecurity.\n\nTuesday\u2019s bi-partisan meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, was the first collective meeting of governors from the South since President Muhammadu Buhari took office.\n\nThe meeting also decided that the President should address the nation. It reaffirmed the ban on open cattle grazing and movement of cows from the North to the South \u201con foot\u201d.\n\nSenators and House of Representatives members from the South threw their weight behind the governors\u2019 decision.\n\nProminent Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) did not only support the governors, they also urged them to back their words with action.\n\nThe Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) also expressed it support.\n\nBut prominent North\u2019s Senator Ali Ndume, Labour leader Isa Aremu and a former Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf faulted the governors.\n\nThe lawmakers called on the governors to \u201cswiftly follow up on their resolutions by immediately approaching the leadership of the National Assembly\u201d to actualise their demands.\n\nThe statement by Southern Senators Forum (SSF) Chairman, Opeyemi Bamidele; Secretary-General, Matthew Urhoghide and Publicity Secretary, Chukwuka Utazi, reads: \u201cAt this critical point of our national life when the economy is bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment, and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens.\n\n\u201cAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to the ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\n\u201cMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping, raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\n\u201cWith this uniform resolve by our governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914.\u201d\n\nThey also saluted the governors for seeking restructuring of \u201cour highly lopsided Nigerian nation.\n\nThe lawmakers said restructuring \u201c will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the House of Representatives, members from the region urged the Executive to hearken to the governors by convoking a national dialogue.\n\nIn their statement, members of the House insisted that the ban on open grazing across the country is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements that heightened insecurity.\n\nThe statement was signed by Minority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu; Deputy House Leader, Peter Akpatason; Deputy Chief Whip, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu and Deputy Minority Whip, Adesegun Mujid Adekoya.\n\nOther signatories were Dolapo Badaru, Jimoh Ojugbele, Femi Fakeye, Segun Odebunmi, Mayowa Akinfolarin, Olufemi Bamisile, Oluwole Oke, Victor Nwaokolo, Kingsley Chinda, Essien Ekpeyong Ayi, Fred Agbedi, Francis Charles, Patrick Asadu, Lynda Ikpeazu, Sylvester Ogbaga, Nkem Abonta and Jerry Alagboso.\n\nThe statement partly reads: \u201cThe platform of Southern members in the House of Representatives supports our governors restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring\u2026\n\n\u201cWe also support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, our platform assures of our readiness to deploy our legislative instruments to ensure speedy achievement of the reforms and constitutional amendments that will guarantee a restructuring towards the practice of true federalism in our country and we are rallying our colleagues from other parts of the country in this direction.\u201d\n\nPANDEF noted that the meeting, though long overdue, was a welcome development.\n\nIt added that such gestures could not only foster cooperation, but strengthen democracy\n\nThe group, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Ken Robinson, said, \u201ctheir resolutions re-emphasised our positions, particularly, on restructuring, open grazing, and the alarming state of insecurity.\u201d\n\nIt noted that with rising insecurity, many Nigerians now live in fear and unable to pursue legitimate livelihoods in the country.\n\nOn skewed appointments into federal agencies, PANDEF said that its National leader, Chief Edwin Clark, and 15 other prominent Nigerians, are in court with the Mr. President over the serial breaches of the federal character in appointments by this administration.\n\nIt expressed happiness that the governors discussed many issues agitating many citizens in the South, stressing that the positions by the governors are in tandem with the \u201cthoughts and expectations of the people of Southern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNdume, Aremu, group lash out at Southern governors\n\nTwo prominent Nigerians and a group of stakeholders faulted some of the demands of Southern governors at their Tuesday meeting in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nThe governors among others, demanded urgent national dialogue, a quick end to insecurity, full enforcement of the ban on open cattle grazing restructuring of the country and a review of appointments into government departments/security agencies to reflect diversity.\n\nBut the Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Ali Ndume; a frontline labour leader Issa Aremu, a former Executive Secretary of the national Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf and the Integrity Friends for Truth and Peace Initiative (TIFPI), accused the governors of hypocracy, insensitivity and playing to the gallery.\n\nNdume accused the Southern governors of engaging in a blame game by calling on President Muhammdu Buhari to address security lapses in the country.\n\nNdume told reporters in Abuja that as the Chief Security Officers of their respective states, governors ought to know what to do to stem the growing tide of insecurity.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs far as I am concerned, this blame game will not solve the problem. Governors are the chief security officers of their states, so, why are they talking about the President without talking about themselves?\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker called on President Buhari to stop the salaries of legislators and civil servants if that is what is required to enable the government to concentrate funds in fighting insecurity.\n\nHe also argued that if the government could borrow to finance infrastructure, there was nothing wrong in using loans to fight insecurity.\n\nNdume also faulted the ban on open cattle grazing, saying the governors deviated from the real issues.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not about open grazing. The problem is security. Most of the security problems confronting Nigeria is not in the bush.\n\n\u201cWe have four different types of security challenges-insurgency, farmer-herder clashes, secession calls, and banditry- in the six geo-political zones. The most important thing is for the security agencies to be provided with the basic equipment to confront these challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Borno South senator also commended the military for stopping Boko Haram insurgents from infiltrating Maiduguri on Tuesday night.\n\nIn Ilorin, Kwara State, Aremu said the clamour by the Southern governors for restructuring amounted to \u201chypocrisy and double standard\u201d.\n\nHe argued that it was ironic that some of the governors who \u201dunacceptably resisted simple autonomy for Houses of Assembly, the judiciary and local governments,\u201d are calling for restructuring\n\nAremu, at a Ramadan lecture by the Kwara State Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in memory of his wife, said while Nigerians can accommodate \u201cmore discussions,\u201d the country should not be turned into \u201ca debating society.\u201d\n\nHe added that what Nigerians needed now \u201cis a performing Republic\u201d that guarantees sustainable peace and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany conferences had interpreted Nigeria\u2019s problems, additional summit is one too many, too wasteful and too diversionary.\n\n\u201cIt is time to walk all the talks. Governors should collaborate across regions, across parties, not divisive regional platforms, initiate marshall plans of economic renaissance to lift 100 million out of poverty as envisaged by President Buhari and get youths off crimes.\u201d\n\nOn the ban \u2018on open grazing,\u2019 the labour leader said governors are not elected \u201cto oppose\u201d but \u201cto propose and implement\u201d alternative measures that would ensure food security.\n\nAremu observed that the insecurity in the country is \u201ca legacy problem of non-inclusive governance and underfunded police force by past military regimes.\u201d\n\nThe TIFPI said the communique issued by the governors was fraught with irregularities and misconceptions of real issues.\n\nExecutive Director of the group, Livingstone Wechie, said in a statement in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, that they were disturbed that at a time the country was on fire, the governors were asking for a national dialogue.\n\nWechie said: \u201cIt is worrisome that at a time when the rooftop of the union is on fire and the foundation is bleeding, the streets are burning with escalating tension and violence, our governors are talking about national dialogue, which historically has never been taken seriously by the government as per implementation.\u201d\n\nHe said the communique showed that the understanding of Southern governors on the subject of restructuring and the current situation began and ended with state police and revenue allocation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cWhy can\u2019t they ask, \u2018why do we have separatist and secessionist groups? What are the root causes and how do we engage to resolve to save the implosion? Why can\u2019t they be on the same page with all ethnic structures which they govern on these issues?\u2019\n\n\u201cCan you ban open grazing through a mere communique and how do you enforce that in a beggarly manner without addressing the unending ethnic agitation for land ownership which rights are sequestered in the disputed 1999 constitution and unrighteous Land Use Act?\n\n\u201cThey must realise that this is a crisis for the self-determination of a people, who feel enslaved by a fractured system, held bound by the fault lines of a disputed constitution that took all their lands, resources, and political rights from them.\u201d\n\nThe NHIS boss, Prof Usman Yusuf, said the ban on open grazing was irresponsible and dangerous.\n\nYusuf asked the governors to provide free land for herders to graze their cattle.\n\n\u201cGathering in one hotel and giving a blanket ban on open grazing is irresponsible and will get us nowhere,\u201d he said while featuring on an Africa Independent Television (AIT) programme.\n\nHe added: \u201cSouthern governors need to provide places where these Fulani will graze their cattle because they (governors) own the land.\n\n\u201cWe saw that in Zamfara. The governor is trying to build big ranches in each of the three senatorial zones for these Fulanis to settle and graze their cattle. For governors to ban people from that place is dangerous.\n\n\u201cAsk all the 17 governors that met in that hotel, was there any Fulani leaders consulted? They (governors) are there making laws for people they have not consulted. This is the problem of government \u2013 disconnected, out of touch with the reality of the people.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nPresident Muhammadu\u2248 Buhari, yesterday, joined other Nigerians to mourn former Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Lt. General Joshua Dogonyaro, who died at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) at the age of 80.\n\nThe president described Dogonyaro as a thoroughbred soldier who professionally distinguished himself in the course of his military career.\n\n\u201cThe death of Dogonyaro comes as a great shock to me because as a soldier, I know what it means to lose such an officer and a gentleman who gave his best in the service of the country.\u201d\n\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said his death was \u201ca great loss not only to the Nigerian military, but also to the country because of his patriotic sacrifices in defence of its unity and territorial integrity. Laying down one\u2019s life for the country is one of the greatest sacrifices any citizen can make to his country. General Dogonyaro\u2019s incalculable contributions will be remembered for years to come.\u201d\n\nAlso, framer governor of Abia State and Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Kalu, commiserated with the government and people of Plateau State over the demise of the former CDS.\n\nAccording to Kalu, the deceased was a gallant army officer who served in various capacities in the military.\n\nIn his condolence message, the former governor condoled with the family, friends and associates of the late military officer, while praying for eternal rest for the deceased.\n\n\u201cI condole with the Dogonyaro family over the demise of their patriarch, General Joshua Dogonyaro (retd).\n\n\u201cThe late military officer served in various positions in the Nigerian Army during the military era. He was a gallant officer and seasoned administrator. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Dogonyaro family at this sorrowful time.\u201d\n\nKalu prayed to God to grant the deceased\u2019s family the fortitude to bear the loss\n\nPlateau Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, expressed deep shock over the death Dogonyaro.\n\nLalong, in a statement in Jos, said Plateau State and the nation have lost a patriotic and loyal Nigerian who served with courage, dignity and selflessness.\n\nHe recalled Dogonyaro achievements during his career in the Army where he held several command positions and accomplished his assignments with tremendous success.\n\nFormer governor of Plateau, Jonah David Jang, described the death of Dogonyaro, as a great loss to Nigeria in the fights against insecurity.\n\nJang, in the statement in Jos, said the country would miss his wealth of experience in the search for peace and unity.\n\nHe was the Chief of Defence Staff during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.",

Let us look at it, people in the South are talking too much, and people up North are acting too much.\n\n\u201cIn Yorubaland, we talk too much. The North is also preparing to leave and they are working at it. Do you think it is a mistake that they are constructing railway to Niger Republic when we have not built railway from Ibadan to Kano, not even Abuja, and they said it is the first place we are going to spend our money?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the refinery in Kaduna be repaired? Why are they saying they would build another refinery in Daura (Katsina State)? And they would be bringing crude oil from Niger Republic to the place.

If you are saying because of that you want to go or do don\u2019t want to go, who even tells you that the north is not even getting ready to go?\n\n\u201cLet us look at it that you people in the South are talking too much, and the people up North are acting too much. In Yorubaland, we talk too much. Even, people that don\u2019t know anything about what the idea is all about will also speak on it.\n\n\u201cThe North is also preparing to leave and they are working at it. Do you think it is a mistake that they are constructing railway to Niger Republic when we have not built railway from Ibadan to Kano, not even Abuja, and they said that is the first place we are going to spend our money? Can\u2019t the refinery in Kaduna be repaired? Why are they saying they would build another refinery in Daura (Katsina State)? And they would be bringing crude oil from Niger Republic to the place. Don\u2019t let us deceive ourselves, maybe a time will come when all of us will sit down together and separate peacefully.\n\n\u201cWe have seen examples of countries that separated. We have two examples. One, Czechoslovakia went their separate ways peacefully, and they are still friendly allies. But Yugoslavia went into war. So, when we continue talking and engagements, if we cannot live together again, all of us will know that there is no reason to fight to keep the entity together any longer.\u201d\n\nOn the ban placed on open grazing by all the governors in the Southern Nigeria after their meeting held in Asaba, Delta State this week, Ladoja noted that the law has been there and this is not the first time such ban would be placed on open grazing. He added that each state had done it separately in the past and he was optimistic that the coming together of the governors to place a ban on open grazing would be effective.\n\n\u201cOpen grazing is not sustainable. We cannot say what was happening in Nigeria 50 years ago should continue today in Nigeria. What was the population 50 years ago, and what is the population today? The number of cows that people are slaughtering in the abattoir today, maybe that was what they were slaughtering in one month in years back. So, we have to find a way of going for a sustainable system. All over the world, even in Botswana, they have more cows than human beings; yet they did not have open grazing. We should also conduct it and we should now see cow herding as a business. It should be taken seriously, not where everybody can just go and say \u2018I am a cow herder.\u2019\n\n\u201cI think I support what they (the Southern governors) moved because the law has been there. There is open-grazing law in Oyo State. Unfortunately, we have not seen it being implemented because we still see cows roaming the streets. It is possible, now that all the Southern states\u2019 governors have agreed on it, maybe the implementation will start in earnest.\u201d\n\nLadoja stated further that the ban on the open grazing in the Southern Nigeria is part of the lasting solution to the rising insecurity in the country, saying: \u201cNow, people have been taking about Fulani herdsmen. If there is no open grazing, there will not be so much Fulani herdsmen\u2019s palaver again. That is the problem we have in Ibarapa and most of the problems in Benue now. So, let us start from the ban on open grazing.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the leadership of security outfits in Nigeria is skewed in favour of only one tribe in the country, saying \u201ca situation whereby the whole of security outfits in Nigeria are in the hands of one tribe, it doesn\u2019t seem to go very well with all of us. We are a federation. We are not only one mono-language people. We are diverse and it is that diversity that made us strong. But it is now become our weakness. That is why people are losing interest in what the government is doing. That is why there are agitation for restructuring, dissolution and it is just because of the discontent.\n\n\u201cWhen that is in practice, it means most of the time that the best men are not in position. When you have people that are not competent, running a system, the system will at the end of it collapse. But let us only hope that Nigeria will survive.\u201d",
          "summary": "Answering question on agitation for self-determination in the country, Ladoja said: \u201cLet us start with tolerance.\n\u201cThe North is also preparing to leave and they are working at it.\n\u201cOpen grazing is not sustainable.\nAll over the world, even in Botswana, they have more cows than human beings; yet they did not have open grazing.\nIf there is no open grazing, there will not be so much Fulani herdsmen\u2019s palaver again.",

          "text": "\u2022Atiku, Lawan, Saraki, Tinubu preach righteousness\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday went spiritual in the search for solutions to the insecurity ravaging the country with a call on Nigerians to pray for an end to banditry, kidnapping and desperate quest for power.\n\nBuhari, in a message he personally signed to celebrate Eid-el Fitr, urged Nigerians to shun the temptation to retreat into their communities.\n\nSimilar messages from former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu; and a former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, also tasked Nigerians on the need for righteousness and prayers for the nation to overcome its problems.\n\nBuhari implored the citizenry to pray against kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of Nigeria as a united entity.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile sending his best wishes to all Nigerians and Muslims across the globe as they mark the Eid Al Fitr the president said:\n\n\u201cUnity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges, which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithful during Ramadan.\n\n\u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities.\n\nThese are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also urged Nigerians to continue to observe all COVID-19 prevention measures and celebrate responsibly during the holidays.\n\nLawan felicitated with the Muslim clerics in Nigeria on the completion of this year\u2019s Ramadan fast, saying: \u201cEvery true Muslim feels joy at participating in the Ramadan fast, which is a key obligation in Islam. May Almighty Allah, therefore, reward us for the spiritual voyage and grant our earnest wishes for ourselves, families and dear country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, due to the current security and economic challenges, Nigeria needs the prayers of every patriot now more than ever before to achieve peace, unity, and progress were the dreams of the founding fathers.\n\nHe assured the people that the government, including the National Assembly, will not waiver in its determination to provide security for the people to allow law-abiding citizens the liberty to live in peace and pursue their legitimate businesses anywhere.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us remain strong in our hope that Nigeria will become what we fervently want it to be: a nation that fills its citizens with happiness and pride.\u201d\n\nTinubu also joined Muslims in marking the completion of Ramadan fast.\n\nIn a message issued yesterday by his Media Office, the former Lagos State governor stated that as Muslims, they had fasted and prayed in a special way during this holy month.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan must guide our actions and conduct going forward. Let us put politics aside and continue to pray to Almighty Allah for our country and its entire people.\n\n\u201cLet us remember President Muhammadu Buhari and his government in our prayers that they may be given the requisite strength and wisdom to protect the nation, defeat the challenges that confront us and help establish Nigeria as a more prosperous and just land.\u201d\n\nAtiku in a statement said this year\u2019s Eid-al-Fitr come at a time when Nigeria was going through challenging moments concerning the security of lives and property and when a large number of people were hard hit by the ravaging scourge of poverty.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, we need to remind ourselves of our obligation to ensuring peace and unity within our family and in our neighbourhood at all times.\n\n\u201cToday, across Nigeria, there is a scary and growing tendency to mistrust along ethnic and religious lines. As Muslims, we know from both the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Noble Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that no tribe or race is superior to another, except the one that seeks piety to the Almighty Allah,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the Head of his media office, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, said: \u201cThe current situation in our country requires a sincere change of mindset by all Nigerians. We should use this post-Ramadan period and the lessons we learnt from the fasting period to steer clear of any action which does not bode well for our country. This is a period when we all need to pray to Allah to once again pull the country back from the precipice.\n\n\u201cWith the level of insecurity and economic crisis which have combined to worsen the rate of poverty in Nigeria, all Nigerians must unite and demonstrate patriotism that will help our country overcome the present challenges.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I commend our security agencies at the frontline and pray that Almighty God will protect and give them victory over the insurgents and other non-state actors inflicting violence on our country. May Allah heal our land of any form of affliction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist outstanding allocations are paid\n\n\u2022Say pact must be backed by law\n\nBy Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nStriking judicial and legislative workers have given fresh conditions to suspend their industrial action, insisting that the federal government should prevail on governors to immediately release all outstanding allocations due to the other two arms of government, still in their custody since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe workers restated that they would not negotiate the provisions of the constitution on financial autonomy for the two arms of government and demanded that the governors should immediately set in motion the process of establishing the fund allocation committees in all the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) made the demands in a written response to the proposals made by state governors and the federal government on how to resolve the dispute over financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in each state of the federation.\n\nThe federal government and the governors of the 36 states had earlier agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the workers\u2019 unions at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, sought to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY had reported exclusively that under the new template, the governors would establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nBut in their response to the government\u2019s proposal, which was submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Tuesday, the striking workers also demanded that a law be immediately enacted to back the implementation of any agreement reached with the governors.\n\nA top official of one of the unions told THISDAY that the workers were also demanding that \u201cin consonance with the Executive Order 10, that whatever monies that are in the possession of the governors and are yet to be disbursed should be disbursed immediately.\u201d\n\nHe added that the unions are also insisting that there should be uniformity of the law setting up the fund allocation committees to ensure a common template for revenue sharing in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nThe official said: \u201cWe demand that there should be a law in all the states to back up the revenue-sharing template. In addition, in consonance with Executive Order 10, the governors should also ensure that whatever that is their hands that they have not disbursed are released. They should disburse it immediately. They should put in motion the process of setting up the State Fund Allocation Committee as proposed.\n\n\u201cThere should be uniformity in the law setting up the revenue sharing template in all the states. We don\u2019t want a variant of the law. It doesn\u2019t matter what a state generates. We know that every state will not have the same amount because some of the states earn derivation fund. What is important is that the sharing formula is the same.\u201d\n\nOn having the governors as signatories to any agreement reached to resolve the financial autonomy dispute, the source said JUSUN and PASAN insisted that each state governor should sign the agreement by himself and not through a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, in continuation of negotiations to end the dispute, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, on Tuesday held a meeting with the representative of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, on how to respond to issues raised by the striking workers.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting followed the receipt of a written response by the workers to an earlier offer made by the governors in a bid to resolve the lingering dispute.\n\nIt was learnt that Ngige, Lalong and others were not able to trash out the issues and had agreed to meet again yesterday (Wednesday) in order to allow for wider consultations.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that a meeting with the leadership of the workers may be convened tomorrow to iron out the remaining issues with a view to secure the suspension of the strike.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN have been on strike for over one month.\n\nThe unions are seeking the full implementation of the constitutionally guaranteed financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Again, prices near $70\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has picked 16 consortia for its new crude-for-fuel swap contracts for one year starting in August.\n\nA report yesterday by Reuters listed the consortia to include major Swiss trading firms, Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as large Nigerian traders, Sahara Energy, Oando and MRS Oil.\n\nOther companies which qualified for the contracts, according to a list sighted by THISDAY include: AY Mai Kifi, based in Kano; Litasco, a South African firm; Bono Energy, Lagos; Duke Oil, an NNPC subsidiary; Eyrie Energy, based in Abuja; Asian Energy Services; Prudent; BP and Mocoh.\n\nThe contracts, known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP), are coveted since they are used to supply nearly all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol needs as well as cover some of its diesel and jet fuel consumption.\n\nThe companies were invited on Friday to submit commercial bids, which were due on Tuesday, according to the report.\n\nThose involved in the process said the list of winners was unlikely to change substantially, with the new DSDPs expected to replace those from 2019, which were extended until mid-2021.\n\nTraditionally, if a foreign oil company wins, then it is typically paired with at least one local firm.\n\nNNPC uses a DSDP mechanism to secure Nigeria\u2019s fuel requirements in exchange for crude, a practice that has gone on for years as all the country\u2019s refineries have remained comatose.\n\nIn an interview last year, NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said the DSDP had resulted in savings of more than $1 billion a year since its introduction.\n\nNigeria relies almost entirely on imports to meet oil product demand because of significant and prolonged operational problems at its 445,000 bpd of refining capacity.\n\nThe country consumes over 350,000 bpd of petrol with the majority sourced from Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices rose yesterday on signs of a speedy economic recovery and upbeat forecasts for energy demand supported by vaccinations against COVID-19 although waves of infections in India and Brazil curbed gains.\n\nBrent crude climbed 83 cents, or 1.2 per cent to $69.38 a barrel, earlier in the day, with West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude rising 86 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $66.14.\n\nAs at yesterday evening, prices of Brent had hit $69.86, a few cents shy of the much expected $70 while WTI was at $66.56.\n\nIt coincided with a monthly report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which noted that demand for oil will exceed the output of top producers.\n\n\u201cThe anticipated supply growth through the rest of this year comes nowhere close to matching our forecast for significantly stronger demand beyond the second quarter,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nOil prices were also supported by the outlook from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which on Tuesday stuck to a forecast for a strong recovery in world oil demand in 2021, with growth in China and the United States, outweighing the impact of the coronavirus crisis in India.\n\nPrices were further impacted by data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group showing that U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to May 7.\n\nThe fall came before the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a cyberattack last Friday, forcing the shutdown of a pipeline that transports more than 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Kingsley Nwezeh\n\nChairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, has declosed that the anti-graft agency recovered $153 million from former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nHe said the agency also recovered the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million from the minister, who has been living in the United Kingdom, UK, since leaving office some years ago.\n\nBawa, who made the disclosure in the April Edtion of its in-house magazine, EFCC Alert, explained that the EFCC would want the former minister to face trial in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are several issues surrounding Diezani\u2019s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that.\n\n\u201cThe other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned,\u2019\u2019 Bawa said.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Federal High Court in Abuja had fixed May 17 for the EFCC to report on how it complied with the court order in the trial of Alison-Madueke.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had accused the former minister of fleeing the country to escape justice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, says despite the current challenges, peace and security will be restored under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdesina compared the present situation of Nigeria to the buildup to Manchester City winning the 2020/21 English Premier League (EPL).\n\nIn an article published on Thursday, and titled \u201cLessons for Nigeria from EPL\u201d, the presidential spokesman said some people, who know what Buhari can achieve, have been working to sabotage the current administration\u2019s efforts.\n\nAccording to him, just like other English clubs challenged Man City at the beginning of 2019/20 EPL season because of the team\u2019s overwhelming success in the previous season, many critics of Buhari are focused on setting themselves against the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRecall what happened in the 2019/2020 season. Man City was eyeing a treble. Three back-to-back seasons as champions, and a record in English football. But the adversaries knew the record that was to be set, so they arrayed themselves against the team. Just as some forces knew the record that was to be achieved by Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerian President, and which he had begun to show since 2015 when he got into office, and they positioned themselves against the government,\u201d Adesina wrote.\n\n\u201cEvery team, big or small, strong or weak, set its sights on Man City last season, flexed muscles, summoned superhuman skills and strength whenever they were meeting the champions attempting a treble.\n\n\u201cThe lesson? When you are high-flying, the centrifugal forces will come against you, and it would only take the grace of God for you to attain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYoruba people call those forces Aiye. When Aiye is on your case, as it was against Man City, and it is against the Buhari government, you need God, and God alone. Aiye (meaning \u2018the world,\u2019 if freely translated) is the negative part of mankind. The pernicious, baleful, sly and scheming part of humanity. If Aiye gets on your matter, you need God and God alone.\u201d\n\nAdesina linked the security situation of the country with the stumble that Manchester City had at the beginning of the season, adding that like Man City, \u201cunder President Buhari, peace and security would be restored\u201d.\n\n\u201cAiye was in full force against it. And the 2020/2021 season was initially not looking promising either. Eight weeks gone, the team was placed 13th on the table. It had lost 2-5 to Leicester City at home in Etihad Stadium, Tottenham drubbed it by two goals, played a draw with teams that couldn\u2019t hold a candle to it in the past, and was generally forlorn and limp. Aiye was having a ball, laughing Man City to scorn. Aren\u2019t they doing the same thing against the government in our country today, due to unrelenting security challenges, some of them possibly instigated by Aiye themselves?\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cVictory came after victory, to the extent that the team was unbeaten in 21 consecutive games in the different competitions it was involved in. From the ashes, the Salamander had risen. Fire could not consume it, and today, Man City are champions, fifth time in 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho says Nigeria will not rise from its current travails? Who says Aiye will always win? Not where God is involved. And God is involved with Nigeria, our own dear native land. Under President Buhari, peace and security would be restored. The economy would rebound. Life would be abundant for the people , and Aiye would be left standing small, holding the rump of the flag of a country it thought had gone into oblivion.\u201d",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

          "text": "Telecom giant, Airtel, has released its financial report for Q1 2021. It increased its data and mobile money subscribers significantly between January and March 2021. The company also saw a massive rise in profit from Q1 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021.\n\nComparing revenue from Q1 2020 with the first quarter of this year, Airtel saw a significant increase in revenue. The revenue for Q1 2021 stood at $1.03 billion, dwarfing Q1 2020\u2019s revenue of $899 million by 21.7%. However, a constant currency change puts the revenue growth at 15.4%.\n\nAs with previous reports from Airtel and other telecom giants like MTN and Safaricom, voice is still king. However, data and mobile money recorded increases of 31.7% and 38.7% from Q1 2020, respectively.\n\nThe report says that the COVID-19 pandemic has \u201cshown that the telecoms industry is a key and essential service for these economies, allowing customers to work remotely, reduce their travel, keep connected and have access to affordable entertainment and financial services.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the period in question, revenue from voice stood at $547 million, 12.8% (constant currency) more than last year\u2019s. Although considering currency fluctuations, the revenue would be 7.2% higher (reported currency).\n\nIn terms of subscribers, Airtel nailed a 6.9% growth from Q1 2020. Its total subscriber base grew from $110.6 million in Q1 2020 to $118.2 million in Q1 2021.\n\nData revenue in Q1 2021 increased by 31.7% from Q1 of 2020. The $315 million revenue from Q1 2021 surpassed Q1 2020 \u2014 $253 \u2014 by $162 million.\n\nThe rise in data revenue can be inferred from the increase in data subscribers. The network increased its data subscribers by 14.5%, putting the number of data subscribers at 40.6 million, 5.2 million more than 3.4 million in Q1 2020.\n\nAirtel\u2019s Mobile Money accounted for the least revenue, with $110 million in revenue. However, it surpassed the $83 million of Q1 2020 by 38.7%. Its mobile money customer base went from 18.3 million in Q1 2020 to 21.7 million in Q1 2021, an 18.5% increase.\n\nThough mobile money accounts for the telecom giant\u2019s least revenue, it wants to drive financial inclusion with the platform. It believes that the unbanked customers across the 14 countries where it is present can benefit significantly from its mobile money services.\n\nAirtel has increased its mobile money agents by 30.7%. However, the report did not state the number of mobile money agents there was prior and the precise number it\u2019s at now. Airtel\u2019s Mobile Money services currently serve 21.7 million customers, 18.3% of Airtel\u2019s customer base.\n\nDespite a mere 6.9% growth in total subscribers, Airtel recorded significantly higher profit from Q1 2020. Q1 2021\u2019s profit before tax was $215 million, a 121% rise from $97 million in Q1 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter tax, Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 profits stood at $154 million and $77 million, respectively, a 100% difference between both periods. Airtel attributes the staggering rise in profit to the effective execution of its strategy.\n\nThe company generated total revenue of $422 million in Nigeria for Q1 2021, a 23.9% rise from $377 million in Q1 2020, making it the telecom giant\u2019s biggest market for the period in question.\n\nAirtel recorded more revenue in Nigeria than in the East African countries \u2014 Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia \u2014 where it is present.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s growth surpassed all six countries combined, East Africa still has significant revenue growth of 23.9%. It exceeded its $310 million revenue in Q1 2020 by $48 million, bringing Q1 2021\u2019s revenue to $358 million.\n\nFrancophone Africa also boasts of big business between January and March 2021. Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and the four other Francophone countries where the network is present saw a revenue increase of 15.9%.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria outperformed all seven countries by $162 million (38.4%). Francophone Africa recorded a revenue of $260 million in Q1 of 2021, a significant leap from $215 million in Q1 2020.\n\nSurprisingly, Airtel still plays second or third fiddle to its competitors (MTN and Glo) in major markets. Perhaps this is why Airtel Africa\u2019s parent company, Bharti Airtel, has appointed Segun Ogunsanya \u2014 Airtel Nigeria CEO \u2014 as Airtel Africa CEO.\n\nSucceeding Raghunath Mandava as the new CEO, Ogunsanya\u2019s management of Airtel Nigeria, a large market, could help Airtel Africa lead telecommunication in Africa.\n\nAirtel\u2019s boisterous performance in Q1 2021 would appear that its strategy is working. With such margins between the same period in 2020, keeping to the strategy could yield amazing rewards for the telecom company.\n\nFeatured image credit: Photo Credit: jbdodane Flickr via Compfight cc\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "title": "NIGERIAN CSOs PETITION ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FOR SHELL CARBON ENERGY REDUCTION PLAN \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City, Nigeria\u2026Over 30 Nigerian Civil Society organisations have opposed the Archbishop of Canterbury support for Shell Carbon Energy Plan, and have requested the Archbishop to withdraw such support for a favourable Church of England position.\n\nIn a letter of 10th May 2021 signed by over 30 civil society organisations, convener of the groups, the Rev David Ugolor ANEEJ said that even though the organisation agree with the Archbishop that \u2018we all have moral and financial responsibility to address the climate emergency\u2019, they are \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 and \u2018concerned\u2019 that the Church of England\u2019s Pension Board is lending its moral and financial authority to Shell, and plans to vote for Shell\u2019s climate and energy plan at its 2021 Annual Meeting.\n\n\u2018Nigeria has deep experience with Shell, and as representatives of Nigerian citizens\u2019 groups we wish to tell you that we feel that the company is the opposite of accountable to most Nigerians, and has a track record of making misleading statements and commitments. Shell should not be rewarded for setting a long-term ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nWe need urgent action now, starting this year. It is not acceptable for the Church to sign off on a Shell plan for this decade that makes no absolute carbon emission reduction pledges, includes huge increases in gas production, and relies on improbably large amounts of tree-planting. Indeed, Shell\u2019s rush to find land for \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 might well lead to further carbon colonialism, slavery and human rights violations in the global south. Aiming for net-zero carbon emissions has become another effort by polluting entities like Shell to avoid cutting emissions but rather continue in the harmful practices that drive global warming.\n\nNet zero is not zero emissions. It simply means polluting and assuming the equivalent amount of carbon is absorbed by trees or is mechanically captured and stored by an assortment of risky and unregulated geo-engineering proposals. Endorsing Shell\u2019s plan is akin to handing the corporation a right to toy with planetary systems while the poor and vulnerable continue to fight a losing battle against global warming\u2019, the CSO letter to The Most Revd. Justin Welby read.\n\nThe groups said that they strongly disagree with the Church of England position that the Shell goal on Carbon Emissions is \u2018clear and unambiguous, and Shell is accountable for delivering that target\u201d.\n\nThe letter to Archbishop Justin Welby said that because the Church of England has an important voice in the world on many topics, it must take responsibility to lead engagement with the company on behalf of the Climate Action 100+, an initiative involving over 500 investors worth $54 trillion.\n\n\u2018With the effects of climate change more visible every year, the future of our children is at stake, in Nigeria, Africa and around the world. We hope that you hear our call, and take urgent steps to ensure that the church reconsiders its position on Shell. Endorsing the cynical climate plan offered by Shell would mean believing that Earth systems operate according to the principles of calculus and negates the truth that the Earth is a wonderfully created system of interdependent and complex systems that no man can control by mechanical contraptions or imaginations for the sole aim of meeting shareholder\u2019s pleasure. We urge you to use all the tools available to you to encourage all parts of the Church of England to challenge Shell, rather than champion the corporation\u2019s climate and energy plan.\n\nWe pray you to continue to support our demands for ecological justice and the protection of our environment and will be happy to continue the dialogue with you as we look forward to a positive response\u2019, the letter to Archbishop Welby stated.\n\nCivil Society organisations that signed the petition against the Church of England support for Shell Climate Reduction Plan include:\n\n1.

It is hoped that at the end of first phase of the project, 4250 indigenes of Edo State will be empowered. The LIFE-ND is aimed at enhancing the income, food security and job creation for youths and women in rural areas of the Niger Delta,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr. Peter Aikhuomobhogbe said \u201cThe project is geared towards supporting women and youths in agricultural enterprises. The ongoing training will strengthen incubators with strong agric enterprises so that they can take in incubate to enable them to support themselves and have sustainable livelihood.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has said the government is deploying technology to deal with insecurity in the state, urging residents to give relevant information that will assist the government in protecting the lives and property of citizens.\n\nThe governor said this while playing host to Muslim faithful at the Government House in Benin City, as part of activities to celebrate the Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cNation building starts with the individual and in Edo State, I believe that is what we have started. We would continue to work to improve security, which is local as no one can come to your neighborhood, places of worship without someone noticing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has its own responsibility. We can\u2019t wait for them; we must secure ourselves. We are using technology to secure Edo State. Security is local and it is only you that can secure yourself. The problem is that people are reluctant to say anything for fear of being accused, but we are reorganising and changing the narrative in Edo, as we are giving our people a voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building a Command and Control Centre where people can lodge reports and reach the government directly with information on what is going on across the state. We are buying drones, installing cameras and using technology to secure Edo people because the security of all Edo citizens is our prime responsibility,\u201d he noted.\n\nUrging Nigerians to refrain from stoking the embers of disunity and disaffection, the governor noted: \u201cThe biggest problem in Nigeria today is disaffection. The world is changing but people refuse to change but rather causing disaffection across the country pointing to the disunity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people that are not getting what they desire want Nigeria to fail. They are misguided and have failed, as Nigeria will remain united and will not disintegrate. We must not promote disaffection, but do things fairly. Once there is justice and fairness in the land, it will certainly reduce disaffection bringing in peace and harmony.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is a great country as God has given us a diverse country, diverse in everything, particularly its people. Everybody can\u2019t be the same or see things the same way or behave the same way. We have not come from the same tribe, but our beauty as a nation is in our diversity,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat we should do as Nigeria is to bring out the uniqueness in Nigerians that made us great. There is nothing wrong with diversity; it is important and beneficial. We should continue to emphasize unity in diversity as it makes us strong as a nation.\n\n\u201cWhen we complain about Nigeria not working, we are actually complaining about ourselves. But collectively, we can make the country great. We can\u2019t lay the blame of the nation solely on the footsteps of a few people. There may be failure in leadership; there is also failure in followership.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdulfattah Enabulele said, \u201cEdo remains one of the peaceful states in Nigeria and I urge us all to guard it jealously.\u201d\n\n...",

CIPM, Chartered Institute of Personnel Managers of Nigeria, is the umbrella body for the country\u2019s human resource professionals.\n\nThe Bank picked up two coveted awards, the \u2018People First CEO Award\u2019 and the \u2018People First Health and Safety Award\u2019, at the high-profile recognition ceremonies regarded as the \u201cOscars\u201d of Nigeria\u2019s Human Resources industry.\n\nBoth awards celebrate Abubakar Suleiman, Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Bank and the leadership of the Bank\u2019s Human Capital function, for putting employees first following the outbreak of the pandemic last year by ensuring a strong focus on the physical and mental health, welfare, and safety of employees.\n\nCIPMN presented the awards in partnership with the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), the chartered body and leading global membership organisation for safety and health professionals. IOSH is a champion, supporter, adviser, advocate, and trainer of those who protect the safety, health, and wellbeing of others.\n\nCommenting on the awards, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) of Sterling Bank, Temi Dalley, said, \u201cNavigating an unprecedented and globally challenging crisis such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a defining moment for organisational leaders in 2020. We are favoured at Sterling to have an ingenious leader who operates with a remarkable balance of wisdom and empathy.\n\nOur CEO displayed an exemplary range in how he led Sterling through the abrupt and relentless changes that the pandemic heralded. He acted beyond the role of a Chief Executive Officer in this period and was our Chief Humanist Officer, Chief Protection Officer, and Chief Motivation Officer. He tasked himself with the overall wellbeing and continued productivity of over 4,000 employees that constitute the Sterling workforce through a difficult time, never navigated before.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dalley, in the immediate outbreak of the pandemic, Sterling Bank\u2019s first response was the \u201cgo home, stay home\u201d advisory to employees regardless of role or essentialism of function. Constantly, communication of the \u201cSafety before Service\u201d mandate set for all employees occurred through multiple channels, with leaders bringing its true meaning alive by example.\n\nThe Bank did not leave employees to deal with problems arising from the pandemic alone. Avenue was created to report perceived exposure or symptoms of COVID-19 to the Wellness Desk for advice on further actions, including isolation and testing at the Bank\u2019s designated centres with costs borne by the Bank.\n\nApart from tailoring its policies to protect pregnant employees, nursing parents, and those with underlying illnesses, the Bank also factored in the health, safety and wellbeing of their aged parents and relatives.\n\nSterling\u2019s response to the pandemic placed its people first and adequately created a balance between employee safety and continued optimum performance. Its mentally and physically healthy workforce, working either fully remote, shift, or on-site, is a testament to that. Additionally, the Bank\u2019s employee engagement trust index increased from 81% in 2019 to 87% in 2020 with no life and job loss due to the pandemic.",

          "text": "Queen Luwoo was the 21st ruler of Ife, according to transcribed oral history, and a forerunner well ahead of her time.\n\nHer reputation has not been generous to her, despite the fact that she was once the most powerful Yoruba monarch.\n\nIl\u00e8-If is a town in Osun state that is revered as the Yoruba people\u2019s cradle and ancestral home, making any presiding monarch, the ni, a very powerful chief.\n\nThe Ooni is revered as their spiritual leader and Chief Custodian of Customs by his subjects. Men have always occupied the respected stool, according to the Ooni dynasties, which date back hundreds of years.\n\nREAD ALSO: Restructuring, Akeredolu to Buhari, you can\u2019t push 17 Southern Governors aside\n\nSince ancient Nigerian history was largely handed down orally, transcribed lists of previous Oonis vary and often contradict one another.\n\nHowever, most accounts say that Ooni Luwoo, a female, was the 21st Ooni of Ife, Ile Ife\u2019s supreme traditional ruler. She was succeeded by Ooni Lumobi after Ooni Giesi.\n\nThe legacy of Ooni Luwoo\n\nSome sources refer to her as Lwo Gb\u00e0gd\u00e1, a descendant of Otaataa from Okerewe\u2019s Owode compound. She was said to have married Chief Balran of Ilode and had Adekola Telu, the founder of Iwo town, as her son.\n\nShe was the first and only female to take the crown as Ooni after the demise of Ooni Giesi.\n\nOoni Luwoo was a stunning woman who took great pride in her beauty and the appearance of her surroundings. As a result, she put the entire town of Ife to work, both men and women, to keep the town clean and beautiful.\n\nShe was also known to commission the unique Yoruba custom of construction of decorative pavements and open-air courtyards paved with pottery shreds.\n\nThe streets of Ile-Ife were paved with quartz pebbles and broken pottery as punishment for anyone who committed an offence.\n\nThe criminals were told to bake the clay, then break it up with their bare hands and lay it out on the floor for the queen to step on.\n\nShe was so refined and particular that she refused to walk on the bare floor, and some of the hand-made clay tiles she walked on during her reign can still be found in parts of Ife and other Yoruba lands she visited.\n\nHowever, she was perceived as wicked and a terror to the Yoruba people and deemed \u201cuncontrollable\u201d and \u201chigh-handed\u201d by the elders of the land.\n\nAfter her reign came to an end, the Obas\u2019 council gathered and vowed that no woman would ever be made Ooni of Ife again.\n\nAdeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, the 51st Ooni of Ife, is the new Ooni.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday pledged said his administration is working hard to tackle insecurity confronting the nation and he hopes Nigerians understand.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the State House shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast, President Buhari said that the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Watching Israel-Palestine Conflict With \u2018Great Concern\u2019 \u2013 Foreign Ministry\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against the bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHe said his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.\n\n\u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources. For example, when we came in, in the Northeast, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest and we are dealing with it,\u201d said the President.\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, President Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\nHe also commended the National Assembly for its support, saying that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari then made an appeal to the nation\u2019s elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers. It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, the Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members, and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.",

          "text": "The UK\u2019s Daily Mail is reporting that Zinedine Zidane will almost certainly leave Real Madrid at the end of this season, regardless of whether they win La Liga.\n\nThey face Granada Thursday night and if they pick up a victory they will still be two points behind Atletico Madrid with two games to go.\n\nBut the 48-year-old coach, who has won two league titles and three Champions League crowns in less than four seasons, has all but made up his mind to walk away after the final game of the campaign at home to Villarreal on May 23.\n\nZidane will be an immediate target for Juventus and for the France national side if they make a change after the Euros this summer.\n\nMadrid president Florentino Perez will be under pressure to promote Raul to replace him. He currently has the club\u2019s youth team on the verge of promotion but Perez could also turn to Max Allegri.\n\nZidane has sensed for some time that he no longer has the backing of Perez and even a third league title, one that will make him the first coach to retain the league for Madrid since Leo Beenhakker in 1989, is unlikely to change his mind.\n\nZidane has maintained he has the overwhelming support of the dressing room this season and a disagreement this week with left-back Marcelo, leading to him being left out of the squad for tonight\u2019s game, is not at the heart of the coach\u2019s discontent.\n\nThe Brazilian will be off at the end of the season anyway. Their falling-out is being seen more as a symptom than a cause of what looks like an imminent divorce.\n\nMarcelo believed Zidane was overly critical of a recent Real Madrid training session when he had urged his players to prepare with more intensity for a must-win game.\n\nHe spoke back to the manager in front of the squad and has been omitted from the trip to Granada.\n\nMarcelo may not have played anyway because despite having depleted options in defence for tonight\u2019s game, Zidane was considering picking promising 19-year-old Miguel Gutierrez to start.\n\nThe young players who have emerged in recent weeks are now the only thing that could keep Zidane at Madrid.\n\nIf he is persuaded to build a new team around Gutierrez, centre-back Victor Chust, midfielders Sergio Arribas and Antonio Blanco, with the prospect of the club continuing its pursuit of Kylian Mbappe, then his mind could be changed.\n\nBut he does not believe there is a will in the Real Madrid boardroom to convince him to stay.\n\nMadrid have threadbare resources going into tonight\u2019s game. Alvaro Odriozola, Eder Militao, Nacho Fernandez and Gutierrez will be the back four because they are the last four fit defenders.\n\nZidane\u2019s midfield trinity of Toni Kroos, Casemiro and Luka Modric are fit to start alongside another of his favourites, the Uruguayan midfielder Fede Valverde. And he must decide between Marco Asensio and Eden Hazard to partner Karim Benzema.\n\nIf Madrid are beaten, then Atletico could clinch the league by winning at home to Osasuna this Sunday.",

          "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is \u201canxious\u201d about a rise in the UK of the coronavirus variant first identified in India.\n\nA closely-monitored study of infections in England found the variant is becoming more prevalent just ahead of the next big easing of lockdown restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe want to make sure we take all the prudential, cautious steps now that we could take, so there are meetings going on today to consider exactly what we need to do. There is a range of things we could do; we are ruling nothing out.\u201d\n\nIn its latest assessment published Thursday, Imperial College London said overall cases have fallen to their lowest level since August following a strict lockdown and a successful rollout of vaccines. However, it warned that the Indian variant should be closely monitored.\n\nThe so-called REACT study found that the Indian variant, designated \u201cof concern\u201d because it could be more transmissible, was identified in 7.7% of the 127,000 cases tested between Apr.15 and May 3.\n\nProfessor Steven Riley from Imperial College said it\u2019s unclear whether the Indian variant is more transmissible but warned that \u201cthis is a risk.\u201d\n\nThough the British government and scientists have said new cases may start to go up in coming weeks, it\u2019s unclear whether that will lead to a big increase in hospitalizations and deaths given that most of those people deemed vulnerable have been vaccinated.\n\nOver the past few weeks as India has suffered a catastrophic resurgence of the virus, concerns have grown around the world about potential new variants bypassing the protections offered by vaccines.\n\nAcross the UK, lockdown restrictions are being lifted. The next easing in England is set to take place on Monday when two households will be able to mix indoors and pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers inside, among other changes. The other nations of the UK\u2014 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 have also laid out similar plans for the coming weeks.\n\nThe government hopes to lift most remaining restrictions on social contact in June.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I can see nothing that dissuades me from thinking we will be able to go ahead on Monday and indeed on June 21, everywhere, but there may be things we have to do locally and we will not hesitate to do them if that is the advice we get,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe government\u2019s scientific advisory committee, known as SAGE, will be making recommendations about the pandemic\u2019s path. It is due to meet later.\n\nCurrently there are few signs the previous easing has led to an increase in new infections, which are averaging around 2,000 a day across the UK, compared with nearly 70,000 recorded in January at the peak of the second wave.",
