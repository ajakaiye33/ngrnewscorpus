          "text": "The Adamawa State House of Assembly on Monday approved a request by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to take a N100 billion loan.\n\nThe sheer size of the loan request immediately triggered heightened interest in the opposition circle, with a member of All Progressives Congress (APC) leading a verbal protest against it right on the floor of the House.\n\nThe House itself had underlined the potential of the request to raise public uproar when it made the planned sitting a top secret, keeping information about it from even highly placed administrative staff of the House and the press crew.\n\nWhen the House finally sat, newsmen who heard what started as an unverified speculation, rushed to the House complex when sitting was eventually about to commence but were barred from entry into the Press Gallery or anywhere near the floor of the House.\n\nMultiple sources disclosed after the sitting, however, that the House had approved Governor Ahmadu Fintiri\u2019s request to accept bond facilities to the tune of N100 billion.\n\nDiscrediting the process leading to the loan approval, the member of the House representing Verre constituency, Abdullahi Umar Yapak who is of the opposition APC, said the process did not follow due process.\n\nYapak who is the Chairman of House Committee on Interparliamentary, Labour and Employment, said he had to walk out of the plenary when the acting speaker, Pwamakeno Mackendo who led the session, insisted on the loan request being granted.\n\nYapak said, \u201cI received a text message yesterday that we should convene at the assembly complex. I was not told what the sitting was for.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in, the deputy speaker who led the plenary in acting capacity brought three letters and I rejected all the three letters. But what baffles me much is the N100bn loan which the governor is seeking.\n\n\u201cI objected to that because there are procedures, there are financial regulations which we have to abide by. There is provision in 2021 budget, a column for domestic borrowing and in that column, we approved only N20bn. Because of that I staunchly stood my ground that we should not approve a loan above N20bn.\n\n\u201cWhat took place in the House today was wrong because the poor man in the village will not understand what we are doing here. I advised that they should split it to N25bn this year, next year and the remaining two years, they still objected.\u201d\n\nHe said he had to walk out of the House after his call for obedience to procedure and House standing rule was ignored.\n\nGovernor Fintiri who had on assuming office in 2019 complained that he inherited N140 billion loan, had, before the current N100 billion request, obtained about N27bn loans, including N15 billion infrastructural loan, N9.9bn housing loan, and N2bn COVID-19 loan.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the new N100 billion loan request was for, but our correspondent gathered that the government had earlier said it meant it for development of the agricultural sector.\n\nA statement passed to newsmen in the wake of the controversy over the loan request, indicated that the Adamawa State Executive Council had on Wednesday last week approved the issuance of N100 billion bond \u201cfor the Adamawa State Agric Business Support for the period of four years.\u201d\n\nThe state Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Dr Umar Garba Pella, was quoted in the statement as disclosing the reason for the bond while briefing newsmen shortly after the council meeting presided over by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri.\n\nThe Commissioner said the Council also approved establishment of Adamawa State Agric Business Support Programme, Five agencies and the repositioning of the Agricultural Development Programme.",

          "text": "The Adamawa State House of Assembly on Monday approved a request by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to take a N100 billion loan.\n\nThe sheer size of the loan request immediately triggered heightened interest in the opposition circle, with a member of All Progressives Congress (APC) leading a verbal protest against it right on the floor of the House.\n\nThe House itself had underlined the potential of the request to raise public uproar when it made the planned sitting a top secret, keeping information about it from even highly placed administrative staff of the House and the press crew.\n\nWhen the House finally sat, newsmen who heard what started as an unverified speculation, rushed to the House complex when sitting was eventually about to commence but were barred from entry into the Press Gallery or anywhere near the floor of the House.\n\nMultiple sources disclosed after the sitting, however, that the House had approved Governor Ahmadu Fintiri\u2019s request to accept bond facilities to the tune of N100 billion.\n\nDiscrediting the process leading to the loan approval, the member of the House representing Verre constituency, Abdullahi Umar Yapak who is of the opposition APC, said the process did not follow due process.\n\nYapak who is the Chairman of House Committee on Interparliamentary, Labour and Employment, said he had to walk out of the plenary when the acting speaker, Pwamakeno Mackendo who led the session, insisted on the loan request being granted.\n\nYapak said, \u201cI received a text message yesterday that we should convene at the assembly complex. I was not told what the sitting was for.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in, the deputy speaker who led the plenary in acting capacity brought three letters and I rejected all the three letters. But what baffles me much is the N100bn loan which the governor is seeking.\n\n\u201cI objected to that because there are procedures, there are financial regulations which we have to abide by. There is provision in 2021 budget, a column for domestic borrowing and in that column, we approved only N20bn. Because of that I staunchly stood my ground that we should not approve a loan above N20bn.\n\n\u201cWhat took place in the House today was wrong because the poor man in the village will not understand what we are doing here. I advised that they should split it to N25bn this year, next year and the remaining two years, they still objected.\u201d\n\nHe said he had to walk out of the House after his call for obedience to procedure and House standing rule was ignored.\n\nGovernor Fintiri who had on assuming office in 2019 complained that he inherited N140 billion loan, had, before the current N100 billion request, obtained about N27bn loans, including N15 billion infrastructural loan, N9.9bn housing loan, and N2bn COVID-19 loan.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the new N100 billion loan request was for, but our correspondent gathered that the government had earlier said it meant it for development of the agricultural sector.\n\nA statement passed to newsmen in the wake of the controversy over the loan request, indicated that the Adamawa State Executive Council had on Wednesday last week approved the issuance of N100 billion bond \u201cfor the Adamawa State Agric Business Support for the period of four years.\u201d\n\nThe state Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Dr Umar Garba Pella, was quoted in the statement as disclosing the reason for the bond while briefing newsmen shortly after the council meeting presided over by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri.\n\nThe Commissioner said the Council also approved establishment of Adamawa State Agric Business Support Programme, Five agencies and the repositioning of the Agricultural Development Programme.",

          "text": "Renowned Constitutional lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Sebastine Hon, has insisted that the realization of financial independence of the Judiciary in the country lies solely with the federal government.\n\nHon argued that the ongoing indefinite nationwide strike by the judiciary workers in Nigeria could have been averted if the constitution had been properly understood and interpreted by parties.\n\nIn a strong-worded letter to the Chief Justice of Nigeria, titled: \u201cThe JUSUN Strike Action and The Correct Position of The Constitution on Financial Independence For The Judiciary in Nigeria\u201d, the constitutional lawyer said that all courts of superior records are creation of the federation and not of any state.\n\nIn the letter obtained by DAILY POST on Tuesday, Hon said that the 1999 Constitution, \u201chas made far-reaching provisions guaranteeing, in express and unequivocal terms financial independence for both superior and inferior courts in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nAccording to him section 6 of the 1999 constitution listed the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), High Court of a State, Sharia Court of Appeal, FCT, Sharia Court of Appeal of a State, Customary Court of Appeal of FCT and Customary Court of Appeal of a State as courts of superior records and creation of the federation.\n\nHon argued that be it the Federal High Court or High Court of a State, they are all creations of the federation and therefore should derive funds directly from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF).\n\n\u201cSection 318(1) defines Federation as the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Clearly, therefore, the framers of the constitution wanted those courts that are wrongly labelled State courts to be courts of the Federal Republic of Nigeria- meaning they are Federal courts, which are, however, established for each state, just for geographical and other administrative reasons\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSince these are also \u201cFederal\u201d courts established to function within states of the Federation, therefore, they are supposed to also be part of the expenditure content of Mr President\u2019s annual budgetary estimates submitted to the National Assembly\u201d, he added.\n\nHe faulted the issuance of Executive Order 10 by President Muhammadu Buhari, which he noted prescribed other budgetary methods for states not contemplated by the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe said Executive Order 10 is also in conflict with the express provisions of Sections 6(1), (3)(5) read together with sections 81(3) and 84(1)(4)(7) of the Constitution. It indeed runs counter to the very section 121(3) as amended since as against the wrong notion held by Mr President, neither the original text of that subsection nor its amended version has anything to do with superior courts of records, even though located in the various states and acting as state courts.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, asked the National Judicial Council (NJC) to as a matter of urgency assume responsibility for collecting, collating and fine-tuning budgetary estimates in respect of superior courts of record from the various Heads of the courts for onward delivery to the Budget Office of the Federation to be included in the annual budget of the federation.\n\nThe senior lawyer also asked the NJC to disburse funds meant for the superior courts of record directly to them once the funds are made available to it.\n\nHe argues, \u201cunder the present constitutional scheme of things, the state governments are only to take care of the budgetary needs of magistrates and other courts lower to the superior courts on the judicial ladder of the state.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Order 10 signed by Buhari on May 20, 2020 is unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect, it being in conflict with the express provisions of the 1999 Constitution\u201d.",

          "text": "Misheck Nyandoro, a Johanne Marange Apostolic sect member with 151 children from 16 wives has revealed that he has no plan of stopping anytime soon.\n\nThe polygamist from Mbire in Mashonaland Central of Zimbabwe, told The Herald that he is planning to take his 17th wife soon so that he can add to his 151 children.\n\nNyandoro said ;\n\n\u201cMine is a project. This polygamy is a project that I have undertaken since 1983 and will end with my death. Whenever that day death visits, is when I will stop marrying and fathering children.\n\n\u201cI am planning on taking in my 17th wife this winter and the formalities are already being worked on.\"\n\nHe also described polygamy as a project which is now bearing fruit as he is constantly receiving money and goodies from his children and son-in-laws. Nyandoro also claimed that Western Europe has a big project to reduce Africa\u2019s population and he's against that.\n\nThe polygamist said;\n\n\u201cFrom my working children and getting pampered with money through EcoCash, almost daily and 11 of my children have put me on funeral policy. I get goods from sons-in-law.\n\n\u201cI have not stopped making babies, the sky is the limit. I have not stopped marrying either, God allowing, I will go even up to 100 wives and maybe 1000 children. Western Europe has a big project to reduce Africa\u2019s population and am against that. I am a war veteran, the Government pays for my children\u2019s fees. I have no problem.\u201d\n\nThe 66-year-old also disclosed that life is good as he does not go to work, but sits in a shed where he is fed by all his 16 wives who all prepare food for him separately. He said that he only eats the best-prepared food and throws away the rest.\n\nNyandoro said;\n\n\u201cEvery wife cooks her best every day because the rule is I only eat what is delicious and I throw away what is not tasty. Every wife subscribes to that rule and does not get annoyed when I return her badly cooked food to her. It is the rule here. Rejected food should make her cook better next time\n\n\u201cMy church does not allow women to cook together. Each must cook on her own in as much as she sleeps in her own bedroom.\u201d\n\nHe also boasted that his only duty is to make sure that his wives are satisfied in the bedroom. Nyandoro said he takes into account a number of variables in coming up with the duty roster for his 16 wives\u2019 conjugal rights. Claiming that he does not take any sex enhancement drug to satisfy his wives, he added that he is the only person who knows and maintains the duty roster.\n\nThe polygamist said;\n\n\u201cI am strong and feel as strong as I was when I was 18. I give conjugal rights to an average of four wives a night and I do the duty roaster personally. I go to the targeted bedrooms one by one. That is my job. There is no other job I do. They are all catered for and you can see they are happy. Afternoon conjugal rights are not considered during the duty roster, for, that is mainly accidental.\n\n\u201cThe moment I see the next woman, she is a completely new person and I feel like I haven\u2019t done anything before. There is no magic but a sound mind. Never be lied to about juju or magic or anything. To me, every wife is a new person. It feels different.\n\n\u201cWhen I am dealing with each wife, I tune myself to her age and demands so that we operate from the same level. What I do with the young wives is not what I do with the elderly ones.\n\n\u201cBut again the reason why I am marrying two or three more in the recent future is that the elderly wives are no longer much interested in sex.\n\n\u201cAt times I am chased away or told to go for the younger ones.\n\n\"I am not employed. My duty is to satisfy my wives. I know each of them personally and I satisfy them accordingly.\u201d\n\nHe also said that he followed his church\u2019s tenets when choosing a new wife and will never marry someone who was married before or someone who is a minor.\n\nNyandoro added;\n\n\u201cI married all my women according to church discipline. I never married an under-aged girl. I wait for 18 years. The church does not allow me to marry someone who was once married. NO!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have paid lobola accordingly. None of the wives was organised for me. I approached each one of them personally.\u201d\n\nNyandoro\u2019s huge family survives by farming. He was recently allocated 93 hectares near Mvurwi Mountains after the government took note of his family\u2019s need. He said that after every harvest, he makes sure to share equitably according to the needs of the 16 wives.\n\nAt the moment, 19 of Nyandaro\u2019s children are employed. 6 are members of the Zimbabwe National Army while 2 are members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police. Another 11 are employed in different professions. He also has 13 sons-in-law after marrying off 13 daughters.\n\nHerald Zimbabwe",

          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nDespite disbursing $18 billion stimulus package and about N39 trillion loans to customers in the last one year, some vocal critics of the Nigerian banking industry have accused it of being a major contributor to the menace of corruption, poverty, unemployment, insurgency and related crimes ravaging the country today.\n\nAccording to Prof Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno State, whose domain is under the Boko Haram seige, poor banking support for a critical sector like agriculture, particularly in the Northern Nigeria, has affected and weakened the once vibrant sector thereby negatively distorting economic development in the region.\n\nThe governor lamented that as a result of the banking industry failures \u201cthe three geo-political zones in Northern Nigeria are now rated as zones with high poverty indices that are worse than those in other zones. There is insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, robbery, corruption, fraud, stealing and other vices. Indeed, poverty in Nigeria, as a whole, not just in the North, is being caused by corruption.\n\nCorruption has been identified as one of the main threats to Nigeria\u2019s ambition of achieving the 2030 goals of Sustainable Developments and its aspiration to lift more than hundred million of Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years,\u201d Zulum lamented.The governor, represented by Senator Aba Aji, the Secretary of North East Governors Forum, who stated these recently at a public forum in Lagos, added: \u201cThe mainstay of the Northern Nigeria, as you all know is agriculture.\n\nBanks, being the institutions of financial intermediation, are expected to assist agriculture by providing finances to improve production. But inadequate financing has continued to bedevil this important sector and poor banking support for agriculture in Northern Nigeria has created and perpetuated a weak agricultural system in the region. \u201cWhen you go through the length and breadth of Northern Nigeria, you will see rich arable land with vast bodies of water and rivers.\n\nIt all shows that region is blessed with variable minerals such as gold, thyme, bauxite, zinc, limestone, columbite, lead, gypsum and other precious stones. But here, poverty pervades. This is because most of its largely agrarian entrepreneurs who are rural area dwellers could not plug into the formal system due to opportunity barriers created mainly by banks. I, therefore, make a passionate appeal to all bankers to liberalise their lending policies to Northern Nigerian farmers and other entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nA recent report by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on the Depository Corporation Survey report for August 2020 put credit to the economy at N38.67 trillion just as its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed that combined stimulus measures to the economy stood at about US$18 billion, which is close to 4.5 per cent of the GDP.",

          "title": "Banditry: Residents of Abuja suburbs flee",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Molly Kilete and Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja\n\nThe spate of banditry attacks and kidnappings in villages and towns in Abuja sharing boundaries with Niger State have forced most residents to abandon their homes for places they consider safe.\n\nDaily Sun investigation revealed that the most affected towns are Bwari, Kuje and Kubwa where mass exodus of persons have been witnessed recently.\n\nIn Bwari, it was learnt that those who have abandoned their homes cited constant underreported attacks by bandits and frequent abductions of family members by kidnappers as reasons.\n\nResidents of Bwari, who spoke to Daily Sun, said kidnapping is now a regular occurrence, lamenting that streets are now deserted at sunset, over fears that people could be abducted for ransom.\n\nCommunities mostly affected in Bwari are located around the Nigerian Law School, Veritas University and areas bordered by mountains and forests close to Niger State.\n\nSimilarly, in Pegi, a fringe town in Kuje Area Council of Abuja, residents are relocating in droves to the metropolis, as bandits and kidnappers operating in the area have intensified their activities in recent weeks.\n\nThe development in Kuje has forced major schools to shut down. Some of the schools that have shut down are SS Simon & Jude Seminary, Kuje Abuja, Louis Ville Girls, Gwagwalada and Hand Made Girls, Kuje.\n\nResidents living around the mountains in Byazhin, Kubwa, also lament the increase in vices, such as kidnapping and rape. They said strange faces who visit the market from those mountains, occasionally, to buy foodstuffs, are becoming frequent.\n\nThose who spoke with Daily Sun said their environment was no longer safe, as they could no longer go out freely, due to fear of being kidnapped and raped, irrespective of gender.\n\nChioma Okereke, a resident, said that prior to the recent development, it used to be said that kidnappers were after the rich, but lamented that today, it is no longer so, \u201cbecause the hardship in the country has pushed both the thieves and other crime perpetrators to kidnapping because even when they steal, nobody is willing to buy the stolen items.\u201d\n\nFurther investigation revealed that despite the repeated kidnappings by suspected bandits and payment of ransom, the FCT administration, led by the Minister, Muhammad Bello, was yet to summon an emergency meeting with community leaders of the affected areas, on how to address the issue.\n\nIn Kuje, about 37 minutes from the Presidential Villa, residents are not leaving anything to chance. In Pegi, which has become the epicenter of major abductions in Abuja, residents, who are majorly from the southern part of the country, are relocating to the metropolis.\n\nA resident said the place was becoming a ghost town. \u201cThe adjourning road linking the community and Abuja is in a deplorable state. Bandits who operate in a thick forest along the road, lay ambush everyday,\u201d said a resident did not want to be named.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have lived and done business in this area for more than 20 years. I have never experienced the type of fear that we are passing through these days. It is just that it is not easy for one to move with his family to another person\u2019s house. If not, we would have moved.\n\n\u201cThe condition is becoming alarming by the day. These days, we witness influx of strange faces coming to the market to buy foodstuffs, especially during the weekend. We are really scared. Something needs to be done very fast.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Susan Useni, said: \u201cThis country has turned into something else. Before, when you hear of kidnappers, you would say it doesn\u2019t concern you because it was believed to be for the rich; but, today, things have changed. They are now after everyone. This year, almost all my family fruits are wasting in the farm because everyone is afraid.\n\n\u201cThe last group of family members who visited the farmland for harvest ended up paying ransom, depending on what you can afford. Some even paid as small as N10,000. That is to tell you how rampant it has become. Before, you hear religious workers saying they wanted to go up the mountain to pray, but now it is no longer so.\u201d\n\nAminu Alhasan, said they are now after pregnant women and men.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo heavily pregnant women were kidnapped close by here and gang raped. If not for spiritual purpose, how can a normal person settle for another man\u2019s pregnant woman after collecting ransom? Life is no longer safe in this part of the town. On a daily basis, people are kidnapped and money collected quietly.\n\nDespite the fact that Abuja has the nomenclature of a State, the FCT administration has always maintained that the issue of insecurity doesn\u2019t fall within its purview. Instead, it claimed that security agencies, whose headquarters are domiciled in Abuja, should handle the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, there was pandemonium, yesterday, at Karu, a satellite town in Abuja, after commercial motorcycle operators took to the streets to protest the killing of one of their members.\n\nThe protesters set up burn fire, attacked vehicles and passers by.\n\nThe incident, which was said to have started at about 9am saw many Christians trapped in their churches premises until about 2pm when the situation was brought under control.\n\nSoldiers from the Army Headquarters Garrison were drafted to quell the situation which got out of the control of the police.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that trouble started after the Okada riders found the body of one of their colleagues murdered in cold blood and dumped at a valley around the Celestial church and a Muslim cemetery between Nyanya and Karu road.\n\nOn discovering the body, the Okada riders were said to have gathered in their thousands armed with knives, stones, sticks and other dangerous weapons and set burn fire on the major roads, causing heavy gridlock and began to attack innocent persons.\n\nMotorists caught up in the protests were forced to turn back for safety. However, some were not too lucky as they had their wind screens smashed.\n\nOn sighting the police personnel, the protesters were said to have attacked them as more of their members from Mararaba, Masaka, Ado, Nyanya, Jikwoyi and other towns in the area joined their colleagues to attack the police operatives.\n\nIt was gathered that the protest, which started around the Catholic Church in the area, later spread to Jikwoyi, as the protesters were bent on setting the divisional police command there ablaze.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that when the police could no longer handle the crowd, they alerted the military, who immediately deployed soldiers from the Army Headquarters Garrison, to restore law and order.\n\nWhen contacted, the Public Relations Officer for the FCT police command confirmed the report and said the protesters were protesting the killing of one of their members by an unknown gunman.\n\nShe also said the police were working in conjunction with the military were able to restore normalcy. She, however, did not indicate weather or not the police arrested some of the protesters.",

          "text": "\u2022States to set up revenue allocation committees\n\n\u2022New system takes effect 45 days after agreement\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government and governors of the 36 states of the federation have agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nIf the agreement is accepted by judicial and parliamentary workers, who have been on a strike for over one month to press home their demands for financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation, funds from the Federation Account due to each state are to be jointly shared among the executive, legislature and judiciary in each state.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, seeks to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that under the new template, the governors will establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nThe proposal also stipulates that the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) will invoke Executive Order 10 against any state that fails to abide by the terms of the agreement.\n\nA presidency source told THISDAY at the weekend that among the new offers made to the judiciary and legislative workers by the federal and state governments was a reassurance that state governors are committed to implementing full financial autonomy for the two arms of government.\n\n\u201cThey also agreed that they will set up all the structures necessary for the implementation of the financial autonomy, including the budget committee where the judiciaries and state legislatures will forward their expenditure estimates. That will be based on the budget envelope of the projected annual revenue earning for the arms of government as is being done at the federal level,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the source, when the executive, judiciary and legislature prepare their annual budget estimates, they will forward them to the state House of Assembly for consideration and approvals.\n\n\u201cSo when the revenue comes from the federal and the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), the State Fund Allocation Committee will now convene the State Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC), which will now oversee the disbursement of money to different arms of government,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that each state will ensure that it establishes Fund Allocation Committee for its legislature and judiciary to be headed by the head of the courts and the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe two arms of government will also be expected to set up a tenders\u2019 board to be headed by the court registrar and clerk of the state Houses Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the same structure at the federal level would be transposed down to the states.\n\nHe said the same template used by the National Judicial Council (NJC) at the federal level would be adopted in disbursing funds to the judiciary in the states.\n\nHe said under the new arrangement, state Fund Allocation Committee would be headed by the state Commissioner for Finance.\n\nAlso, state Houses of Assembly will be allocated funds in the same manner that the National Assembly receives its allocation after the budget approval.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is a breach on the part of the state government that will trigger off Executive Order 10, which empowers the Accountant-General of the Federation to remit funds directly to the state judicial and legislative arms of government. But if you are doing all that is provided in the proposed template, there will be no need to invoke the Executive Order,\u201d he said.\n\nThe striking judicial and legislative workers had earlier vowed not to compromise on their demands for the implementation of 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThe workers said last week at a meeting with a federal government team, led by Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that the issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries was a constitutional provision that did not warrant any negotiation with governors.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN had also insisted that the governors must fully implement financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation as guaranteed by the constitution before the strike would be called off.\n\nThe federal government had also pleaded with the unions to consider the efforts being made to resolve the dispute and suspend their strike to enable the court and legislatures to reopen.\n\nNgige had said last week that progress had been made in about 90 per cent of the issues in dispute.\n\nHowever, the meeting between the federal government team and the leadership of the unions had ended with an agreement that the unions should go and study the government\u2019s proposal before the next meeting, billed for tomorrow.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal yesterday indicated that it is considering extending the current equalisation scheme in the petrol supply system in the country to the movement of gas across the country to make the product more available and accessible to Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during an interactive session with energy correspondents in Abuja, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) Management Board, Mr Ahmed Bobboi, noted that when the policy becomes functional, it will help tackle inflation associated with increases in gas products.\n\nPEF\u2019s main function is to ensure price uniformity of petroleum products via the reimbursement of marketers for trucking products to filling stations anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nThe executive secretary stated that the scheme had yet to fully take off because the government was still propagating the use of gas as an alternative fuel and was yet to get its full adoption by the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that 2021 to 2030 had been declared as the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, explaining that a lot of consultations were still ongoing with all relevant agencies to make the proposal become a reality.\n\nBobboi stated that the policy was also awaiting the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) which will clearly spell out the new functions of the PEF, stressing that whatever role is assigned the petrol equalisation board will determine the next line of action on the proposed scheme.\n\n\u201cThis is the (equalisation) scheme that we are trying to extend to gas because the government has declared the decade of gas and we have seen that this has been working for the economy for over 45 years effectively.\n\n\u201cBecause things are much better and if you want to see the benefits, then look at it that in the absence of this scheme what happens to other commodities, the economy, to inflation and then many businesses would have been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s working well for petrol and government wants to promote the use of gas, if we can take the practice to gas, we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain,\u201d Bobboi argued.\n\nHe maintained that when the government extends the practice to the gas sector, it will help many Nigerian homes abandon the use of firewood and reduce deforestation.\n\nAccording to him, it will also eliminate the health hazards associated with the use of high carbon fuels like firewood, especially in rural and remote areas.\n\n\u201cThis will make the product available because we have a lot of gas in the country, it will make it affordable which will incentivise the marketers to take it to the last mile, the consumer will also be incentivised because the marketer will bring down his price. This will do a lot of good to the economy. This is our view,\u201d he noted.\n\nBobboi who took time to break down the continuing relevance of the petrol equalisation fund noted that government was not paying a dime in ensuring parity of petrol price in the country, adding that the consumer pays for it.\n\nThe executive secretary emphasised that \u201cbridging\u201d had become even more relevant because most of the pipelines that were supposed to take the products to many parts of the country had been vandalised.\n\nHe stressed that the original reason for the bridging the policy was to act as a buffer on consumers during turn-around-maintenance, adding that even the existing depots have not been functioning properly.\n\n\u201cThe pipelines have been vandalised, now instead of 30 per cent maximum bridging, it is now about 100 per cent. The cheapest we can have is 98 to 99 per cent because the movement through the pipelines is very low,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Muhammadu Buhari yesterday bemoaned the killings in the country that have worsened the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, condoled with the relatives of those who lost their lives in what he called madness going on nationwide.\n\nThe killings continued at the weekend as bandits murdered no fewer than 11 persons in Katsina and Kaduna States.\n\nAlso, gunmen sustained their attacks on police facilities in the South-east as they hit a police station in Umuahia, Abia State capital.\n\nBuhari, who called for a low-key Eid al-Fitr celebration as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic said: \u201cAs Muslims in Nigeria join others globally in preparations towards Eid al-Fitr, a day that is celebrated to mark the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, President Buhari has directed that all celebrations are limited due to the global Coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the president, first family, his personal aides, members of the cabinet and service chiefs who choose to remain in Abuja will congregate in full compliance with COVID-19 protocols at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, Abuja to observe the Eid prayers by 9:00 am.\n\n\u201cThereafter, there will be no traditional Sallah homage to the president by religious, community and political leaders\n\nas was the case last year, the president encouraged such leaders to be content with modest celebrations at home in view of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Islamic clerics and other religious leaders who continue to pray for the wellbeing of the nation and its people.\n\nThe president called on all local leaders to talk to their youths and warn them against being used to incite and foment violence, saying that \u201cif we attack institutions guarding us, who will protect us in future emergencies?\u201d\n\nBandits Kill 11, Injure Three in Kaduna, Katsina\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 11 persons were confirmed killed while three others were injured by bandits in a fresh reprisal by suspected bandits at Tsatskiya community in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State and another separate attack by gunmen in Kaduna.\n\nA retired army sergeant, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed in the Kaduna incident.\n\nThe bandits who attacked Katsina community on Saturday were believed to be avenging a mob action against two of the bandits\u2019 informants who were reportedly killed by some people in the community.\n\nThe bandits, who were said to have invaded the community in the afternoon, also wounded three others who are currently receiving treatment at a Dutsinma town hospital.\n\nResidents confirmed that the bandits were on a reprisal over the recent killing of their informants.\n\nOne of the informants was said to have been killed four days ago in a nearby community called Hakon Kartakawa.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the incident yesterday.\n\n\u201cDuring the attack, two people were equally wounded and are still receiving medical attention at Dutsinma General Hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the attack, the residents of Tsatskiya community and other neighbouring villages fled the village to Dutsinma town for safety.\n\nIn another incident, a retired army sergeant, Christopher Madaki, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed by bandits following an attack on Golkofa community, Jama\u2019a Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, his son, Mr. Clement Madaki, was only injured.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, confirmed the killings in a statement yesterday in Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the killings took place on Saturday night when bandits invaded the community.\n\nThe commissioner also said a breakdown of law and order was averted in Kachia town, headquarters of Kachia LGA following the alleged killing of one Hamidu Nura by one Abba Muhammad.\n\nAruwan said the killings in Golkofa were reported to the state government by the Kaduna State Police Command and the Defence Headquarters outfit \u201cOperation Safe Haven.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, gunmen attacked a police station, named after a former Inspector-General (IG), Mr. Mike Okiro, in Umuahia.\n\nThe news of the attack caused pandemonium in the town as churches abruptly ended their services to enable worshippers flee to safety.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state command, Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the incident while speaking with THISDAY on phone.\n\nHe said the attack occurred at 9.45 am, adding that the attackers came in a bus and two Sienna SUVs.\n\nHe stated that a police officer was shot and wounded in the leg during the attack.\n\nAccording to the PPRO, the building was not burnt as the roof did not catch fire when torched.\n\nHowever, he said the hoodlums invaded the offices and gathered files, documents and furniture and set them ablaze. Also, two vehicles and two motorcycles on the premises were burnt.\n\nThe attack on the Mike Okiro Police Station was the first such incident in Umuahia although no fewer than four police stations have been razed in the state this year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: S'court ruling on Erin-Ile, Offa land dispute must be enforced, says Samuel Alabi",
          "text": "For several decades, the people of Erin-Ile and Offa, two neigbhouring communities in Kwara state, have tackled each other over the ownership of a piece of land situated between both towns. In this interview with The Cable, president of the Erin-Ile Progressive Union, (EPU), Samuel Alabi speaks about the current situation of things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat exactly is the state of things concerning the boundary matter between Erin-Ile and Offa. I understand there was a supreme court judgment?\n\nAlabi: You will recall I addressed the press on 26th, December 2018, bringing this December 14th, 2018 judgment of the supreme court to the attention of the world, and promising to see to its enforcement. As a peaceful and law-abiding community, we have taken several steps towards this end, beginning with serving copies of the judgment on the government of Kwara state and other stakeholders including the security apparatus, and follow-up requests for the implementation. Particularly, we have caused letters of 4th, January 2019; 8th, January 2019; 16th, August 2019; and 12th, December 2019 to be served on His Excellency, the governor of Kwara state to put apparatus in place for the implementation. We have also through the press sensitised the public and all stakeholders on the judgment and its implementation. Such include my press conference of 26th, December 2018 which you referred to, and newspaper publications of 4th, May 2021; and 7th, May 2021, among others.\n\nWhat is the historical background of the conflict leading to this judgment?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabi: Erin-Ile\u2019s claim to the land which remains unassailable, dates back to the 13th century when the town was founded by Princes Mosa Apaayan and Alawode Arebiope who left Ile-Ife to found their own settlement due to chieftaincy tussle in Ile-Ife.\n\nThey founded many other settlements on their way as dictated by constant consultations with Ifa oracle which finally asked them to terminate their journey at Igbota on the outskirts of today\u2019s Erin-Ile. Igbota is where all previous Elerins were buried until the reign of Oba Sunmonu Aroyehun. Erin-Ile\u2019s only neighbour in that vicinity is Ipee, as attested by archival documents, and their common boundary was the Abata stream bisecting today\u2019s Offa. Captain H. R. Oke, the British assistant district officer of Ilorin province in 1925, reported in his Offa town and district reassessment report that Ipee and Erin-Ile, in that order of seniority, were the first to settle in the area, asserting that \u201cErin town was founded about the same time as Ipee and the farm boundary between these two towns (Ipee and Erin) was before the days of Offa town\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Offa people were ever fleeing from a Nupe warrior named Majiya who for unfathomable reasons never allowed them rest. Their flight terminated when Erin-Ile and Ipee offered refuge between themselves and Majiya relented in his pursuit. Offa\u2019s pang for more land has led to incessant conflicts with her benefactors and other neighbours to date. This fact is not lost on Offa people, and it has been well-acknowledged in several fora in the past including an interview in The Nation on August 12, 2007, where Professor (Prince) Jamiu Oyawoye, the Sobalaje of Offa, in answer to a question on the land dispute, remarked: \u201cWe agitated to be moved to our brothers in the South West and because of that what the Ilorin government did as punishment was to remove some towns from under us and each of those towns immediately began to lay claim to their lands such that now the Olofa had little or no land.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat briefly is proof of Erin-Ile\u2019s claim to the land, and this, including empirical evidence dating as late as the early 60s, was the basis of all judgments in favour of Erin-Ile.\n\nOffa also claims to own the land as your community does. There was a newspaper report that claimed that the Alaafin of Oyo once said that Erin-Ile got its land from Offa?\n\nAlabi: That news report came from proceedings before the Dr. Funsho Adaramola boundary settlement commission established to determine the boundary between the two communities. With the highest regard to His Majesty, the Alaafin of Oyo and His Highness the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Zulkarnaini Gambari (of blessed memory), who both testified for Offa before the commission, their testimonies were painstakingly appraised and roundly rejected as farfetched by the boundary commissioner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery attempt by Offa people to rubbish that finding has been rejected by the courts. It is therefore astonishing that they still brandish that report today. That commission of inquiry came about because of cases filed by Offa to challenge the establishment of Erin-Ile Secondary School, claiming that it was being built on their land. Offa Grammar School happened to be the only one in that vicinity in those days, and Erin-Ile people were being denied admission, leading to Erin-Ile\u2019s resolve to establish her own secondary school. The commission\u2019s findings were challenged before the high court and Offa lost up to the supreme court in a decision on 10th December 1973.\n\nThere have been many challenges in court, all of which they lost, including the supreme court judgment of 14th, December 2018 which I referred to earlier. The supreme court emphatically affirmed its earlier decision in ADEMOLA OGUNNIYI & ANOR V. DR. FUNSHO ADARAMOLA & ANOR and specifically upheld the Dr. Funsho Adaramola commission of inquiry\u2019s report which found the boundary to be within today\u2019s Offa, and a plan was drawn to that effect, which the supreme court in both appeals also upheld. The N500, 000 award is a natural consequence of dismissal of their appeal for being an abuse of court process in bringing a long-decided case to court again.\n\nWhen you mentioned requests made to the Governor of Kwara state to implement the judgment, the natural question one is inclined to ask is whether the courts are incapable of implementing their own judgments, or whether they have no apparatus for the enforcement of judgments. Must you wait for the government to enforce the judgment?\n\nAlabi: Thank you for this question. The 1999 constitution in section 287 mandates all lower courts to enforce decisions of the supreme court, and the high court of Kwara state from where the case arose has an apparatus for enforcement of court judgments. But the judgment we are talking about is a peculiar one, having to do with the boundaries between two local government areas, not just Erin-Ile and Offa. The acrimony between the neighbouring communities over the boundary agitation also raises fears of likely resistance to the implementation, especially in the face of open threats of violence by the Offa community. In that circumstance, the law provides that the state government should be involved in the implementation. That is the stage we are now, as the deputy sheriff of the high court of Kwara state has since August last year endorsed our application for a writ of possession entitling us to enforce the judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me quickly emphasise that everything we have done has been in line with the law. When the same supreme court on the same 14th December 2018 delivered a judgment relocating the headquarters of Ilejemeje local government council of Ekiti state from Iye-Ekiti to Eda Oniyo, the Ekiti state government acknowledged the judgment and set up an implementation committee headed by the deputy governor to oversee its actualisation. This has been done, and that is what we are expecting from the Kwara state government.\n\nCould the threat of violence be the reason the state government is hesitant?\n\nAlabi: I don\u2019t believe any force on earth should be able to intimidate a government from carrying out court decisions. Although we have witnessed pockets of violence before and after the judgment, that does not and cannot stop the government from doing its job. Many elections in Nigeria and worldwide have witnessed violence but that has not stopped elections from being held. At least, the government has not told us that anyone is above the law, and that threat or use of violence is the reason why they have not implemented the judgment.\n\nIf you doubt my claim of their threats of violence, I\u2019d just refer you to their statement of claim before the high court in the case decided by the supreme court in December 2018 where they alleged in paragraph 16 that Erin-Ile is only 10 percent of their population and that they can overrun us within one hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was this interview published by Distinguished Nigerian in its Vol. 21 No. 6 Edition, ISSN 2006-2012-2013, where, without mincing words, Hon. (Alh.) Hassan Oyeleke (then of the Kwara state house of assembly) boasted of Offa\u2019s military prowess, that Offa has the three things you need in going to war which he enumerated as resources, population and intelligence. He claimed that wars are not fought once and for all, but usually a continuum. And of course, there was this meeting hosted by the deputy chief registrar (litigations), high court of justice, Ilorin, in the person of chief magistrate, now Justice Nureni Kuranga on 10th May 2019 to chart modalities for a peaceful execution of the 2018 judgment of the supreme court, during which B. F. Lawal from Offa openly threatened bloodshed if any attempt was made to implement the judgment. He even banged the table several times to drive home his point. If these are no threats, I don\u2019t know what else a threat means.\n\nA couple of weeks back, there were reports of an armed conflict between the people of Erin- Ile and Offa. What were the remote and immediate causes of this event where lives were said to have been lost?\n\nAlabi: What you referred to as an armed conflict was actually a one-sided attack by Offa community on Erin-Ile, and that was on 4th, March 2021, and six Erin-Ile lives were lost. This is a manifestation of their threat to overrun Erin-Ile, and that war is a continuum. The fact is not lost on us that the attack was aimed at aborting our attempt to get the supreme court judgment implemented, following our strident call on governmental agencies for its implementation. For instance, by a letter of 28th February 2021, we called on the National Population Commission to complete their demarcation exercise for Oyun local government by capturing the land in dispute for Erin-Ile in line with the judgment.\n\nThat was when the Oloffa of Offa placed calls to the Elerin of Erin-Ile and some prominent indigenes of Erin-Ile that he wanted to establish a separate park for the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), Offa Branch, on the ground that they were having frequent frictions with the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). The Oloffa made it clear that it had nothing to do with Erin-Ile, and that the Elerin had nothing to worry about. As it were, the proposed site is within Erin-Ile land as adjudged by the courts, and the Oloffa rebuffed all entreaties to come off it.\n\nThe plank sellers at the sawmill on that land had evacuated their wares, plants and machinery and while Erin-Ile believed. they were doing so in anticipation of the boundary demarcation, we didn\u2019t know that there were plans to attack Erin-Ile. That is why none of the offa native disputants at the park was reported injured but Erin-Ile people lost 6 lives and several properties located over a kilometer away from the scene of their dispute because no one expected it. I believe that accounts for the remote and immediate causes of the attack. The supposed dispute between the transport unions was a mere fa\u00e7ade to mask the attack, as the supposed rivals keep operating in the same garage to date.\n\nWhat was the idea behind a recent publication where you asked people on that land to come to terms with you and validate their occupation of the land?\n\nAlabi: Thank you. Permit me to first digress by making reference to the judgment of the supreme court which recently awarded a large chunk of Agidingbi, Ogba and environs comprising of about 398 acres of land and over 2000 buildings in the commercial hub of Ikeja to the Akinole-Oshiun Family. The people adjudged trespassers have been given a time-frame within which to deliver possession of their houses to the victorious Akinole-Oshiun family, and it will come to pass if they do not come to terms with the judgment creditor who have been adjudged the true owners. That is the law in action, and if we tow the same path, our case will present no peculiarity in any respect.\n\nHowever, we are not interested in taking over or appropriating anybody\u2019s property. Our call in those publications is in tandem with the assurance we gave to the deputy sheriff of the high court that we are not interested in demolishing or taking over anybody\u2019s house. Once they are ready to come to terms with us, we will gladly permit them to remain on our land. And I am pleased to let you know that some people have keyed in and taken benefit of that gesture. But the full force of the law will be brought to bear on those who are recalcitrant, and we will take no blame for anybody\u2019s loss of his property.\n\nWhat is the way forward to achieving lasting peace between the two communities?\n\nAlabi: Erin-Ile has always towed the path of peace, right from the days of Dr. Adaramola\u2019s determination of the boundary. His Highness Oba Sunmonu Aroyehun, in extension of an olive branch and demonstration of his implicit good faith, inserted a public notice in some newspapers including The Nigerian Observer of Saturday, 20th of May 1972, proclaiming Erin-Ile\u2019s magnanimity in victory and inviting Offa to make offers for a negotiated settlement, but which offers have always been rejected by Offa community. That same gesture is what we have extended to them now. Our stance is dictated by the need to live in peace with all neighbours and the long history of intermarriage between us, which makes violence an unattractive option. In fact, violence should be no option at all and we will not ply that route. Offa people are advised to also embrace peace and stop their threats and actual use of violence to settle disputes, especially after court decisions against them. It is gratifying though, that some have seen reason and are coming forward to validate their occupation. This is the much we can do as a peace-loving community. The Kwara state government should lend its weight to this by taking up its responsibility and borrowing a leaf from the Ekiti state government to demarcate the boundary as adjudged.",

          "text": "SpaceX, an American private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, is seeking necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its internet service into Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by Ryan Goodnight, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, in a meeting with Nigerian Communications Commission\u2019s (NCC) Executive Vice-Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, last Friday in Abuja.\n\nFrom L \u2013 R: Consultant to SpaceX, Levin Born; Director, Spectrum Administration, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Oluwatoyin Asaju; Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska; SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight and Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, during the SpaceX\u2019s presentation to the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Goodnight, Nigeria has been identified as a critical market in Africa. Before the face-to-face meeting happened last week, SpaceX had been discussing with the NCC virtually over the past several months.\n\nAbout Starlink\n\nIn 2002, Elon Musk founded SpaceX to revolutionize space technology and reduce space transportation costs. In 2020, the company expanded its efforts to provide satellite internet service: they called the product Starlink. As of March 2021, Starlink had more than 1,100 satellites in space.\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas.\n\nIt is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nCost and Competitors\n\nStarlink is currently in beta, meaning not everyone can sign up. Its beta service comes with a price tag of $99 (~\u20a640,000) per month. There\u2019s also a $499 (~\u20a6200,000) upfront cost to cover the Starlink kit, which includes all of the necessary hardware: a small satellite dish, a router, power supply, and mounting tripod.\n\nCredit: SpaceX\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these rates are just for beta customers. Prices could change when the service becomes more readily available.\n\nAccording to the company, over 10,000 customers currently have access to Starlink, with over 500,000 orders. It plans to expand into many service areas later in 2021.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink appears to be a more expensive option, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nWith the Nigerian government\u2019s plan to bring in 90% of its population online by 2025, it\u2019ll be open to multiple avenues to bring this to reality. There are already a number of internet initiatives such as Facebook\u2019s 2Africa, a $1 billion undersea internet cable for faster internet in Africa and Google and Econet\u2019s partnership.\n\nStarlink\u2019s presence in Nigeria is exciting, but as we\u2019ve seen from the Google Loon project, which was abandoned earlier this year, time will tell if it succeeds.",

          "text": "I\u2019m bringing Blessing Abeng to centre stage because I am inspired by her dedication to supporting Africa\u2019s rising tech talent through her role as Director of Communications at Ingressive For Good. Blessing is a go-getter who is eager to learn and isn\u2019t afraid to ask questions or have difficult conversations. I admire Blessing\u2019s courage and commitment to keep going despite the occasional obstacles life has thrown at her.\n\nBusy schedules, French verbs, and healthy work habits\n\nYou seem like a busy woman. What does a typical day look like for you?\n\nI think that\u2019s one of the hardest questions to answer. You know how lots of successful people recommend having and sticking to a routine because it helps you plan your life and whatnot? Yeah, that has never really worked for me.\n\nHaha! Really?\n\nYup! When you work in communication, no two days are the same. Some days I don\u2019t sleep. Some days I sleep and wake up at 6 am. And some days I sleep in [laughs]. So the way I plan my day is dependent on my goals and objectives. There\u2019s also the fact that I am taking French classes at the moment.\n\nPause. Tell me why you are learning French?\n\nPlease don\u2019t laugh. I want to be able to dream and think in another language that isn\u2019t English. Learning a different language opens your mind up to a myriad of possibilities and expands the way you think. Learning French has shown me that people think differently based on their first or second language.\n\nVery interesting. Where are you taking classes and how does learning French affect your day-to-day work?\n\nI\u2019m taking a 360 approach to learning French. I\u2019m taking some lessons at Alliance Francaise de Lagos \u2013 which means I\u2019m up early at 5:30 AM to plan and kick off my day before classes start at 8 AM. I also use Duolingo and practice my speaking with online videos and courses.\n\nWow. And you do this every day?\n\nEvery single day. Sometimes during class, I am on my laptop responding to emails and doing some work. As you can imagine, my French teacher teases me a lot about overworking myself. I know the way I work, for the most part, isn\u2019t healthy, and I\u2019m learning that I cannot work like this and survive.\n\nCommunication skills, learning on the job and killing myths:\n\nSpeaking of jobs, what existing skillsets did you have before you joined Ingressive?\n\nI\u2019ve always had great leadership and digital marketing skills. I know my way around offline and online marketing tactics. I\u2019m great at storytelling and one of my strengths is creating and executing strategic plans.\n\nWhat did you learn on the job?\n\nI learned how to communicate with donors. Ingressive for Good is a non-profit company, so managing donors is a different ball game. I had to learn how to speak to donors and effectively communicate what we are doing at Ingressive. I also learned how to better manage my time and allocate my minutes and hours to my job, team members, and family members. The higher you go, the more work you have to do. I had to learn how to prioritize my time effectively.\n\nWhat are some myths you think it\u2019s important to kill?\n\nDon\u2019t just do the work \u2013 show the work. What does that mean? Well, I\u2019ve met people who believe that all they need to do is build a product and their customers will find it. That\u2019s not how things work. If you only do the work, and it doesn\u2019t get in front of the people who need it, you might not grow as fast as you want to. I recommend that founders prioritize showing the work as much as doing the work. If you aren\u2019t capable of doing it yourself, hire a comms person to do it.\n\nWhat skills should aspiring communications professionals be learning?\n\nPresentation skills. Presentation is important because as you grow you\u2019re going to have to start presenting to boards, senior leaders and executives. You need to be able to capture what\u2019s important without boring them.\n\nI also recommend that they should dedicate themselves to learning and assimilating ideas and best practices that are relevant to the industry. And don\u2019t just learn; go out and put into practice what you\u2019ve been taught online or in-person.\n\nHow do you define and navigate professional failures?\n\nFirstly, I remind myself that failing at a project does not mean I am a failure. I have only failed when I stop trying or I think, \u201cI have failed so let me give up.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s a place to exit projects that aren\u2019t working the way you want them to; but I don\u2019t allow failure to kick me down or make me lose my confidence or hope in life.\n\nSecondly, failing at a project does not mean you are not excellent. Failure gives you an opportunity to take stock and figure out what went wrong and what could have been done differently.\n\nThirdly, take your time to process the failure but don\u2019t dwell on it. I also recommend keeping track of your wins and successes. I have a \u201cwin journal\u201d and it helps me remember my accomplishments.\n\nThe intersection of family and work:\n\nMy dad wanted me to be a doctor. Obviously, that didn\u2019t happen. Back in the day, my mother used to get teased about having two daughters. Her co-workers would tell her, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a child yet because you don\u2019t have a son.\u201d\n\nWhat?\n\nYes! She used to cry about it and quite frankly, I stand by the fact that she was bullied at work. She didn\u2019t let it affect the way she raised us though. She simply encouraged us to work harder and prove to naysayers that gender isn\u2019t the ultimate marker for success in our society.\n\nSo you didn\u2019t go down the medicine path. How did you find your way to branding?\n\nA friend of mine recommended that I go to branding school and turn my creativity into a professional career path. I told my dad I was leaving Abuja and moving to Lagos to learn brand management and work in an agency. Even though he wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it, he still supported me. We signed an agreement: if my chosen path didn\u2019t work out after two years, I had to come back home.\n\nTrends, insights, and the future of business and tech in Africa:\n\nWhen you think about the tech and business ecosystem in Africa, what excites you? What do you think is possible?\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t know the future and I cannot predict that any of my thoughts will be fulfilled at some point in this life.\n\nDr Ola Brown once explained that small businesses are the lifeblood of a country. SMEs help with employability and boosting the economy \u2013 which means that we need to see more support for SMEs so they can hire our growing youth population. I believe that there is hope for our employment issues to be solved in the future because of the amount of funding coming into the country. I also see that an increasing number of small businesses are going out of their way to solve problems that our leaders have ignored for too long.\n\nI\u2019m also excited about the startups that are making bold moves. I applaud businesses like Flutterwave, Bankly and Paystack for going over and beyond to change the narrative about innovation and entrepreneurship in Nigeria.",

          "text": "It\u2019s not just that insurtech is rising \u2014 it\u2019s also good to see diversity in what the startups are setting out to accomplish.\n\nTo take one example, Curacel is not an insurance policy provider. Instead, they want to be the backbone on which insurers depend for efficiency. Insurance from Pula and OKO target farmers, differentiating from the pack of health management organisations whose domain is health insurance.\n\nInsurance is a tough business to sell in poor communities as people prioritise present needs over saving against future loss. That poses challenging questions about the business model of insurance in Africa.\n\nInsurance industry respondents to the Catalyst Fund and Briter Bridges survey said commissions are how they make money. That is also how those in the credit business make money. It would seem then that insurers can learn some tricks from credit businesses to know what levers to pull for insurance to be more appealing and adopted by customers.\n\nA lot of the buzz about digital lending is in using data to provide tailored customer products and services. If well deployed, big data and analysis could be the pillar that boosts insurance in Africa, activating a market potential estimated to be up to $68 billion by McKinsey.\n\n\n\nThe investor and startup communities seem to think this future is achievable, a signal that we could yet see more investments into the insurance sector in the latter months of 2021.",

          "text": "Following its official launch, the new Learn at Home audio e-learning platform will provide free, online, and unlimited learning access to more than 100 million Nigerian youths.\n\nThis first-of-its-kind audio e-learning platform will offer unlimited access based on the national mobile phone penetration, low-data, and basic featurephone requirements. The platform is a continuum of Data Science Nigeria\u2019s successful \u2018LearnatHome\u2019 initiative, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, that provided learning to millions of Nigerian pupils amid the COVID-19 disruptive restrictions. Learn at Home is based on an inclusive e-learning approach. It is designed to eliminate the barriers of internet access (data) cost and over-dependency on expensive smartphones in the delivery of locally relevant, convenient, and inexpensive access to quality education.\n\nThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative, www.learnathome.radio is part of an extensive effort to reduce the urban-rural learning disparities in Nigeria.\n\nMastercard Foundation says it is a continuation of efforts to ensure universal learning and improve learning outcomes across all communities in Nigeria. Already, more than 4 million students have joined audio classes with USSD/SMS support, where they receive educational materials on key subjects, based on the Nigerian Educational Research and Development (NERDC) curriculum for primary and secondary school students. \u201cThe disruption of the pandemic did not only halt learning for many, but also revealed and exacerbated existing inequalities in learning opportunities. The purpose of www.learnathome.radio is to ensure children have equal, convenient, and affordable access to quality learning,\u201d said, Chidinma Lawanson, Country Head, Mastercard Foundation Nigeria.\n\nOn the platform, pupils and students from primary 1 to Senior Secondary (SS3) will gain access to a special examination readiness series that includes a collection of solved past questions in WAEC, NECO, BECE, and Common Entrance from 2009 to 2020. Expert teachers have been engaged to provide answers and explanations to the past questions in a step-by-step and easy-to-understand format, with complementary live classes that enable each student to learn at a preferred pace irrespective of location and socioeconomic conditions.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, Toyin Adekanmbi, the Executive Director of Data Science Nigeria, described it as \u201ca creative and innovative approach to democratize learning in Nigeria and provide an effective solution to the challenge of unequal distribution of learning and education opportunities in rural and urban communities.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative will build on the clear successes we recorded in the quest to ensure ongoing learning for children during the pandemic restrictions, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, through our audio classes in several cities in Nigeria. It is specifically designed for smooth functionality on basic feature phones operating on the EDGE or 2G network and low data. For MTN users, it is absolutely free. With this, children in rural and remote communities can learn from the highest quality teachers at their own pace and prepare for important examinations with the best resources and educational aids developed based on the approved curriculum.\u201d\n\nBesides the examination preparation series, www.learnathome.radio features a wide variety of content, including amazing global facts, inspirational quotes, current affairs, common errors in the English language, and much more. Mr. Nwachukwu, one of the parents, already taking advantage of the platform, praised it as a breakthrough innovation. \u201cBefore, platforms like this one, were usually only for those who could afford expensive laptops or smartphones and daily internet subscriptions. Now, every child, everywhere can learn.\u201d\n\nAbout Data Science Nigeria\n\nData Science Nigeria is a registered non-profit organization, run and managed by the Data Scientists Network Foundation, with a vision to build a world-class Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, research and innovation ecosystem that delivers high-impact transformational research, business use applications, AI-first start-ups, support employability and social good use cases. We are poised to accelerate Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic development through a solution-oriented application of machine learning in solving social/business problems. Data Science Nigeria (DSN) non-profit has been in the forefront of data and data science skills acquisition in Nigeria.\n\nDSN runs a broad-based capacity intervention across Nigeria with broader beneficiary base through its free trainings (kids, pre-university students, professionals and business executives across states in Nigeria). These initiatives are in line with Data Science Nigeria\u2019s vision and commitment to raising one million AI talents in 10 years and thus position Nigeria as one of the top 10 AI talent/knowledge destinations with 20% GDP multiplier impact.\n\nAbout the Mastercard Foundation\n\nThe Mastercard Foundation works with visionary organizations to enable young people in Africa and in Indigenous communities in Canada to access dignified and fulfilling work. It is one of the largest, private foundations in the world with a mission to advance learning and promote financial inclusion to create an inclusive and equitable world. The Foundation was created by Mastercard in 2006 as an independent organization with its own Board of Directors and management.\n\nFor more information on the Foundation, please visit: www.mastercardfdn.org",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

We are in government to serve you; we want you to join us and make Edo great again.\n\n\u201cSo, without the commitment and collaboration of these different professional groups, there is not much that we can do because right now, we spend almost N40 billion a year in paying people\u2019s salaries and all sources of emoluments.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cIn the past, we used to get that amount from oil revenue and now, that amount will have to be paid by taxes from you. Therefore, should you not have an input? Should you not have a say? And that say, should it just be about criticizing the government?\n\n\u201cTruly speaking, if we do not build institutions, if we continue in the old ways, trying to build super stars and strong men, we will have no future, because these strong men will die, then what now happens?\n\n\u201cThe money is no longer there as it used to be. The money is with you; it is with us Nigerians. Nigerians have more money than Nigeria. It is the money of Nigerians that will develop Nigeria. It is the money of Edo people that will develop Edo,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe government can do so much and you have seen what we are trying to do with the little resources that we have.

          "title": "Anambra 2021: Ifeanyi Ubah embodies Nnewi aspirations",
          "text": "BY OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen few days ago, governorship hopeful and senator representing Anambra South senatorial district, Dr. Patrick Ifeanyi Ubah, held a rally in his home town of Nnewi, Anambra\u2019s second largest commercial hub, after Onitsha, to declare his intention to run for the office of governor in the upcoming November 6, 2021 governorship polls, there was fanfare.\n\nThousands abandoned their businesses to welcome and cheer on one of their illustrious sons attempting to achieve what none has achieved: govern Anambra.\n\nThe November governorship polls is fairly certain to be a battle among political heavyweights from the state\u2019s Southern Senatorial Zone, which, by the state\u2019s zoning formula, is to produce Gov. Willie Obiano\u2019s successor. But even within the Anambra South, the Nnewi bloc has a peculiar agitation for power, and Senator Ubah, embodies that aspiration.\n\nEasily one of the most prominent towns in Anambra \u2013 a town noted for enterprise and its consequent production of several billionaires, perhaps the most of any town anywhere in Africa \u2013 Nnewi has not managed to replicate its success at business in politics.\n\nDespite producing many individuals of note, both in politics and commerce, such as Nigeria Sir Louis Odumegwu Ojukwu, business mogul and founding president of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, whose son Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, would become the military governor of old Eastern Nigeria and consequently, head of state of the secessionist state of Biafra.\n\nOthers include Innocent Chukwuma, founder and CEO of Innoson Motors; Cletus Ibeto, chairman of Ibeto Group; Cosmas Maduka, Coscharis Group, among others, Nnewi has yet to produce a governor of Anambra State, despite several attempts in the past.\n\nThe inability may well be down to time and chance. But the reason often adduced is that the Nnewi bigwigs often undermine one another, yet the people themselves see it in terms of other groups ganging up against them fearing that a town with such economic power could not be allowed to equally take political power; all of which exist in the realm of political gossip.\n\nHowever, as the state prepares to elect another governor in November, the people of Nnewi appear to have resolved to change their story and are rallying behind their son, Senator Ubah, who is certain to fly the flag of Young Progressive Party (YPP) under whose platform he was elected senator, almost against the run of play, in 2019.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take him for granted. And from what I hear, the people from Nnewi side are determined to make sure that they produce the next governor,\u201d said Mr. Collins Okeke, head, public sector practice group, Olisa Agbakoba Legal. \u201cAnd I understand that a lot of the prominent people there support Ifeanyi Ubah.\u201d\n\nUbah had relied largely on the backing of his Nnewi constituency to emerge senator in 2019 under the relatively unknown YPP, which coincidentally had Kingsley Moghalu, a Nnewi son, as presidential candidate, defying the odds on the occasion to beat both trio of the All Progressive Congress (APC), the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAnd going into the November polls, his people are once again upbeat, hoping to replicate the success of 2019.\n\n\u201cUbah will give Anambra State what it has been yearning for all these years,\u201d said Mr. Chris Ifesi, Southeast chairman of YPP. \u201cYou could see that he is a grassroots man. From the locals, you will be able to know the strength of a politician.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Ubah\u2019s emergence as senator was a protest against the incumbent governor, Obiano, whose decision to deny him the APGA ticket, was largely interpreted as a betrayal of the Nnewi people.\n\nUbah, among several other prominent sons of Nnewi, had supported Obiano and campaigned for him when he sought a second term of office in 2017, with the possible understanding that he would be supported by the governor in 2021. However, both men fell apart when the Obiano led APGA, in the lead up to the 2019 election, denied Ubah the party\u2019s Anambra South senatorial ticket.\n\nUbah understandably sought the APGA senatorial ticket, hoping to use the senate as springboard to launch his governorship bid. But Obiano apparently chose to make his intention of not wanting him near the Awka government house known early enough by ensuring that he never took the party\u2019s senatorial ticket. Ubah would join the YPP and through the platform, actualised his senatorial ambition.\n\nSupported by those who saw Obiano\u2019s move as betrayal, and particularly, people of his Nnewi constituency to whom the governor\u2019s action was yet another ploy to keep them out of power, Ubah defeated candidates of the PDP, APGA and APC to emerge winner of the zone\u2019s senatorial election.\n\nHis victory meant that an open war was now declared between him and the governor who is evidently determined to stop him from becoming governor.\n\nBut Ubah has enough political muscle to give any opponent a headache. His emergence as senator under a relatively unknown political platform was perhaps a good demonstration of his grassroots support base, and going into the polls, he has reasons to be hopeful.\n\n\u201cYou can see the crowd here,\u201d he told reporters when he took his campaign to Aguleri last week. \u201cAs you know, Aguleri is the home town of the current governor. That shows you how people love this party. YPP has come to stay. By the grace of God, YPP will win this election on November 6th.\u201d\n\nUbah s, without a doubt, is a political heavyweight in the state, and has the support of his constituency. And although he is running on a relatively unknown platform, former governor of the state, Peter Obi who became governor under APGA in 2006, after reclaiming his 2003 mandate in court, at a time when the PDP was dominant, is enough prove that a \u201csmall\u201d party can cause an upset.\n\nAt the moment, the list of contenders is long. Under the ruling APGA, notable aspirants include, Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo, Hon. Thankgod Kenechukwu Ibeh, Hon. Chukwuma Umeoji, Hon. Okwudili Ezenwankwo, Hon. Nonso Smart Okafor, Evang. Nicholas Ukachukwu, Mr. Akachukwu Sullivan Nwankpo and Chief Damian Okolo.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) also boasts of a long list of aspirants. They include, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, Dr. Winston Udeh, Sen. Dr. Ugochukwu Uba, Sen. Uche Ekwunife, Dr. Godwin Ezeemo, Dr. Godwin Maduka, Mrs. Chidi Onyemelukwe, Mrs. Genevieve Ekwochi, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo and Mr. Ike Oligbo.\n\nOthers are Hon. Chris Azubogu, Dr. Ifedi Okwenna, Emeka Etiaba, Chief Walter Okeke, Hon. Tony Nwoye and Hon. Chuma Nzeribe\n\nThe ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) has 10 aspirants lined up, including Dr. Chidozie Nwankwo, Engr. Johnbosco Onukwo, Sen. Dr. Andy Uba, Rev. Godwin Okonkwo, Chief George Moghalu, Chief Paul Orajiaka, Mr. Ben Etiaba, Hon. Azuka Okwuosa and Dr. Igwebuike Hygers. Although only three of the aspirants have obtained the party\u2019s nomination form yet.\n\nUbah has only one challenger for the YPP ticket, Emma Nkwocha, but he is certain to take the ticket and face the eventual candidates of APGA, APC and PDP, in what will, on paper, be a four-horse race, which may in reality, boil down to a contest between him and former CBN governor, Charles Soludo, who is projected to take the ruling APGA ticket.\n\nOf all the candidates, however, the odds greatly favour Soludo for a number of reasons. He is likely to emerge the ruling APGA\u2019s candidate. He is a widely popular figure in the state, with experience in public service, and international exposure to boot, and feelers suggest he is being propped by the country\u2019s ruling party, the APC, with the possible intention of him running as vice presidential candidate in 2023.\n\n\u201cSoludo is clearly the candidate to beat, if he manages to take the APGA ticket,\u201d Okeke said. \u201cI cannot see anyone in the line-up who can challenge him credibly, maybe Ubah.\n\n\u201cIfeanyi Ubah is the only candidate that may turn it into a bit of a challenge. Otherwise, I would say that Soludo stands a clear chance of winning.\u201d",

          "title": "Outrage over FG\u2019s N50bn grant to energy sector",
          "text": "By Olusesan Laoye\n\nThere is growing public outrage over the N50 billion the federal government still pays as subsidy to the energy sector which has already been privatised as Nigerians, the Labour Congress and energy experts have continued to kick against it, alleging that it could be another avenue for fraud.\n\nThey were asking what could have been the reason behind such a huge money still being devoted to privatized companies, which have not even shown justification for such gesture with the tax payers money.\n\nIt was argued that despite that Nigerians have not got value for their money, as the power sector still remained comatose, which still puts the entire country in darkness.\n\nThe arguments went further that by now which is nine (9) years down the line since the energy sector had gone to private hands, government ought to have stopped dishing out funds they described, as \u2018father Christmas\u2019 gesture while it was also believed that both the energy sector and the Federal government should be probed as the fund remains a subject of suspicion.\n\nSince the Minister of Power Saleh Mamman made the disclosure that government still fund the power sector with N50billionas part of its 49 percent stake to ensure that energy was not taken away from the reach of the common man, Nigerians have been giving big knocks on the statement, which a Solar energy expert, Engineer Johnson Alabi, described as very annoying and a big insult to Nigerians. Even the Labour unions have not taken kindly to the Ministers pronouncement and wondered why the government is still subsidising companies already privatised.\n\nDeputy President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Joel Ajaero argued that the minister\u2019s argument that the money was still being spent to augment the shortfall by the distribution companies, despite admitting the failures of the Discos not being able to stabilise their operations to other players in the sector was not good enough and it was a slap on Nigerians.\n\nIt would be recalled that in 2013, Nigerian government privatised11 electricity distribution companies (Discos) and six generating companies (Gencos) but it retained 100% ownership of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), under the comprehensive power sector reform to stimulate growth.\n\nThe aim was to expand capacity, increase electricity access and upgrade transmission. As a matter of fact, Nigeria\u2019s power generation is mostly Thermal and Hydro, which, according to records, has an installed capacity of about 12,522 MW.\n\nWith its advantage as the most populous nation in both Africa and especially in West Africa, Nigeria is ranked higher among the 14 West African countries to be a power pool for the Sub- region. This advantage gives Nigeria the capacity to supply electricity to the Republic of Benin, Togo, and Niger.\n\nThe argument therefore, is why the Minister of Power could talk of subsidy to Discos and supply to those neighbouring countries where electricity supply has been stable and reliable, when Nigerians are suffer despite the huge amount spent on power.\n\nAlthough it was said that Nigeria would still need about $100billion in investment in the next 20 years out of which the World Bank is financing $486million from International Development Agency for the Nigeria Electricity Transmission Access Project (NETAP).\n\nIt was believed that with all these, the government should still not have been budgeting to finance power which has failed in private hands to improve the economy of the country.\n\nGoing by the records of the World Bank, which is one of the major financiers of Nigeria\u2019s power and energy sectors, it shows that despite the huge amount of money so far spent on the sectors, less than 50% of Nigerians have access to electricity supply which is far from being reliable.\n\nApart from the World Bank initiative and financial commitments to the power sector, other private and international concerns, such as Siemens are interested to help the country have reliable power supply.\n\nSiemens had also come into this plan to boost rapid economic development of Nigeria. It came under the deal known as the Presidential Initiative (PPI) which began in 2018 with the present All Progressive government led by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe deal as planned would include generating output, revamping of power distribution and transmission system that would promote local skill and sustainable technology.\n\nAs Mr. Jide Adetunji, a chartered Accountant said, Nigeria should have stopped investing on a failed project which has not helped industrial growth. The power sector he argued, due to inefficiency has crippled many businesses and a lot of investments.\n\nHe pointed out that as an auditor of firms and even private individuals and Manufacturers, \u201cyou will be amazed with the kind of losses around, caused by inadequate power supply.\n\nHe said that this has also contributed to hike in prices of products because producers of goods who have to spend more in the production of their goods have no choice but to hike the prices of their goods to meet the cost of production.\n\nHe said that rather than pampering the Discos and the Gencos, they should be sanctioned to sit up or take the business away from them and give to those who would satisfy and comply with the conditions laid down for their operations.\n\nHe also pointed out that the argument of the Minister that the subvention has reduced to half due to increase in the tariff regime, the half still drains the economy of Nigeria and was reason enough to do away with the sets of companies managing the power sector.\n\nAlso an expert in Solar Energy Engineer Johnson Alabi who was the former Deputy chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, who, while speaking to the Businesshallmark on the Ministers statement in a telephone chat, said that he was not talking as a politician but an expert in energy and weeps for Nigeria because \u201cwe have refused to tow the line of truth.\u201d\n\nHe said he was baffled with the Minister\u2019s argument that the Discos and Gencos are sold off and handled as family business making it difficult to be professionally managed, was bitter to hear.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with us here in Nigeria; why should the government retain those who believed that what belongs to the entire country and what the economy of the people depends on and the nation be handled like a family business and the Minister is even not sober about that and came out to tell Nigerians that.\n\n\u201cThe present government is insulting Nigerians by still keeping the Discos and the Gencos. They ought to have been fired and what the Minister should come up with is to tell us why they have not sacked them.\u201d\n\nHe said that as an expert in power and energy, especially Solar, he had made several representations to government on sustainable energy and distribution which are not followed.\n\nHe said that he was so concerned and met the former Minister in charge, Barrister Raji Fashola whom i explained to in details on how to go about it but since then things are getting worse\u201d\n\nAlso admitting the inefficiency of those managing the power sector, the General Manager Finance and Management services of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Abdulkadir Shettima said that the problem with the Disco and Gencos has been that they are just not working in accordance to the contractual terms.\n\nEngineer Alabi cautioned against the government securing another loan which the Special Adviser on infrastructure to President Buhari Ahmad Zakari said, would soon be obtained from the African Development Bank (ADB) after the $500million loan from the World Bank.\n\nHe said the government should show what it has spent the N1.3trillion on for power which he sold out for just N400billion.\n\n:\u201dI wonder why the subsidy would be more than the price it sold the power sector to the private hand. The government is subsidising inefficiency and investment that failed to yield result\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Gencos and the Discos are collaborators and what baffled Nigerians is that despite the colossal amount of money of subsidy and palliatives to the companies, they are still in darkness and the only thing shown for it is 5,000 mega watts\u201d, Engineer Alabi argued.",
          "summary": "It was argued that despite that Nigerians have not got value for their money, as the power sector still remained comatose, which still puts the entire country in darkness.\nThe arguments went further that by now which is nine (9) years down the line since the energy sector had gone to private hands, government ought to have stopped dishing out funds they described, as \u2018father Christmas\u2019 gesture while it was also believed that both the energy sector and the Federal government should be probed as the fund remains a subject of suspicion.\nApart from the World Bank initiative and financial commitments to the power sector, other private and international concerns, such as Siemens are interested to help the country have reliable power supply.\nThe power sector he argued, due to inefficiency has crippled many businesses and a lot of investments.\n:\u201dI wonder why the subsidy would be more than the price it sold the power sector to the private hand.",

          "text": "BY OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen Omeke Anthony (not real name) moved to Lagos in 2008, after his national youth service, it was with the hope of finding a well-paying job, and finding a space in Nigeria\u2019s commercial city\u2019s growing elite class. But after four years of searching for a job without success and completing a masters degree programme in the University of Lagos, the Engineering graduate from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO), decided to start a phone and accessory business, which, according to him, never really took off for want of funds.\n\nBut Omeke\u2019s story changed when he was introduced to crypto-currency in 2015 by a banker friend. Today, he is not just a trader, but also a trainer, running an academy through which he has brought many into the trade and groomed them to become successful readers.\n\n\u201cI am now known as a millionaire maker,\u201d he said. \u201cI have helped many people to make their first millions through crypto. It\u2019s a life changer.\u201d\n\nOmeke by his own admission, is now \u201ca comfortable man,\u201d who has gone from struggling to make a few thousands in a month to now being \u2018well-to-do.\u2019\n\n\u201cI started small,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, I could put, say N50,000 in one coin, N20,000 in another coin and so on. Gradually, they accumulated into something tangible. The best way to make money in crypto is by discovering new ones with potential and investing in them early. Sometimes, you can make returns of up to 2000 percent.\u201d\n\nOmeke is one of millions of Nigerians turning to crypto trade as source of income, and who have defied a ban on the trade, or more specifically, the barring of Nigeria\u2019s commercial banks from facilitating the trade.\n\nCrypto adoption got huge boost in the country in 2015, the same year that Ponzi scheme MMM swept across the country, eventually burning many fingers. Some MMM platforms such as MMM Global relied exclusively on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC), the pioneer crypto whose value has gone from about $1 in 2008 to over $50,000 in May 2021.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the MMM Ponzi scheme, many continued to trade crypto, with adoption growing exponentially in the last six years. Last year, data gathered from leading peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange, Paxful showed that between May 2015 and November 2020, Nigerians traded 60,215 bitcoins, valued at more than $566 million, which placed the country as the world\u2019s second-largest Bitcoin market.\n\nBitcoin trade particularly had its highest spike of 30 percent last year during the national lockdown and the highest volume traded during the peak of the pandemic. Between January and September, Paxful reported a 137 percent increase in new registrations in Nigeria. The company had disclosed that Nigerians make up around a quarter of its customer base with 1.3 million registered accounts.\n\nIn October last year, at the height of the EndSARS protests that rocked the country, the Central Bank of Nigeria wielded the stick against bank accounts that received donations used to finance the protests, forcing the promoters to resort to cryptocurrencies. It was perhaps the move that rattled the country\u2019s regulator.\n\nOn February 6 this year, the CBN issued an order banning commercial banks from facilitating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n\u201cThe Central of Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) circular of January 12, 2017 ref FPR/DIR/GEN/C1R06/010 which cautioned Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), Other Financial Institutions (OFIs) and members of the pubic so the risk associated with transactions In crypto currency refers,\u201d a letter to deposit money banks signed by Mr. Bello Hassan, its Director of Banking Supervision had said.\n\n\u201cFurther to earlier regulatory directives on the subject, the Bank hereby wishes to remind regulated institutions that dealing in crypto curencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited. Accordingly, all DMBs are advised to stop facilitating such transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cNBFIs and OFIs are directed to identify persons and/or entities transacting in or operating crypto currency exchanges within tier systems and ensure that such accounts are closed immediately. Please note that breaches of this directive will attract severe regulatory sanctions. This letter is with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe Cryptocurrency ban created uncertainty in the interim. On Luno, a London-headquartered crypto startup and market leader in Nigeria, with about 3million users in the country, price of Bitcoin dropped from over N20 million to within N18 million, whilst the price was above $40,000 in the global market. On Binance, the biggest crypto exchange platform, the dollar went from N485 to N460.\n\n\u201cBecause a lot of people were new to the crypto market, the news (of CBN ban) created panic. The dollar/ naira exchange rate dropped dramatically as a result. Globally, BTC was flying, but in naira it was not appreciating as such,\u201d Omeke said.\n\n\u201cAt the time, BTC was supposed to be N20 million at over $40,000, but because the naira/dollar exchange came down to N460 to the dollar, when ordinarily it\u2019s supposed to be above N485 as it was before the circular, the naira price dropped because people panicked and stopped buying.\u201d\n\nThe ban hit start-ups facilitating third party transactions through banks particularly hard. Their accounts were reportedly blocked, as well as those of individuals who used theirs to trade crypto.\n\nSoon, however, the things returned to normal as traders found a way around the ban through to peer-to-peer exchange to buy and sell on Binance and other platforms such as LocalBitcoins. Indeed, according to Coin Dance, as at April this year, weekly buying and selling was regularly exceeding N1 billion ($2.6 million), comparable to the volume seen before the ban.\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges, which are decentralized platforms that directly connect buyers and sellers without third parties, have thus become the favoured way to buy bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI used to buy and sell crypto on Luno, but following the CBN ban, I could no longer continue because I was no longer able to bring in or withdraw money from the platform. I could only buy and sell with what I already had there, unfortunately, it\u2019s little,\u201d Patrick Ezeugo, a trader said.\n\n\u201cBut someone later introduced me to Binance which uses peer-to-peer, and I was able to create an account and trade. Basically, you send money to the seller\u2019s bank account and he will release the amount of USDT you have requested to buy, then you can use it to buy coins.\u201d\n\nIn April, two months after the CBN ban, data from analytics platform UsefulTulips, showed that there had been a 27 percent increase in peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading in the country.\n\nStill, last week, Paxful in a similar report, said Nigeria\u2019s cryptocurrency traded volumes on the platform topped $1.5 billion in the first four months of 2021, representing almost a third of Paxful\u2019s global total volume of $5 billion.\n\nThe figures once again, reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s status as one of the exchange\u2019s biggest markets globally, proving that the CBN ban has had little impact.\n\nThe report further noted that Nigeria\u2019s latest total traded volume figure was generated by the platform\u2019s approximately 1.5 million users. In total, Paxful had 6 million users globally by the end of April. In addition to Nigeria, the exchange\u2019s other top four markets globally include the United States, China, India, and Kenya.\n\n\u201cNigeria is still leading and the lead is even growing. Nigeria is further ahead since the CBN\u2019s ban and our value has grown by 15 to 20 per cent. And it is going to continue to grow,\u201d said Paxful CEO, Ray Youssef in an interview with journalists last week. \u201cWe have 1.5 million users here in Nigeria that has moved over $1.5 billion worth of value.\n\n\u201cWith crypto-currencies, we see an alternative, a way to rest the financial system based on equality. Our mission at Paxful is to give everyone equal access to finance no matter who they are or where they are so they can control their own money and build the future they want with financial freedom.\u201d\n\nApart from the lure of immediate and long term gains, the growing uncertainty and instability around the Nigerian naira, which has depreciated significantly within the past months in the parallel market (exchanging for N485 to the dollar at the time of writing), is another reason many are opting for crypto.\n\nIndeed, apart from Nigeria, other African countries like Zimbabwe whose currencies have taken a beating, have seen a spike in cryptocurrency trade led by bitcoin, due to currency fluctuations and uncertain monetary policy.\n\n\u201cFor me, it makes a lot more sense to put my money in crypto,\u201d a banker with one of Nigeria\u2019s new generation banks who doesn\u2019t want his name in print said. \u201cPeople talk about the volatility of the market, but in the long term, it is still much more profitable than most other investments.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Bitcoin has gone from $35,000 in early January to $57,000 in May. In fact, at some point, it was over $60,000. So, yes, in terms of volatility, it is volatile. But when you take stock of these five months interval, you will realize that you are not losing at all.\n\n\u201cObviously, due to the volatility, a short term trader can get his hands burnt, because within a relatively short period, Bitcoin can plunge more than 20 percent, but for a long time investor, if you check the trajectory of Bitcoin and other top coins, say from 2019, you will realize that it\u2019s wise to leave your savings there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment Omeke, who now spends much of his time teaching and researching new coins, shares.\n\n\u201cRemember I was telling you about a new coin, Trust Wallet Token (TWT) in February. At that time, it was $0.4, but now it has crossed the $1 barrier. Imagine that you invested then. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he was not concerned about possible outright ban on crypto, he insisted, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. They can\u2019t ban crypto; they cannot stop us.\u201d\n\nHe, however, cautions that the key is to know which coins has potential and avoiding what is known in the crypto world as \u201cshitcoins,\u201d which is used to describe cryptos with little to no value or that has no immediate, discernible purpose.\n\nIdeally, \u201cshitcoins\u201d diminish in value over time due to failed investor interest because it was not created in good faith or because its price was based on speculation. As such, these currencies are considered to be bad investments.\n\nIn general, optimism is one thing most players in the crypto market share, despite the volatility of the market, and the ever present threat of governments wielding a stick against the trade.\n\n\u201cBanning bitcoin is a fool\u2019s errand. Some will try; all will fail,\u201d wrote Parker Lewis, author of Unchained Capital. \u201cAnd the very attempts to ban Bitcoin will accelerate its adoption and proliferation. It will be the hundred mile-per-hour wind that fuels the wildfire. It will also make Bitcoin stronger and more reliable, further immunizing it from attack and reinforcing its anti-fragile nature.\u201d\n\nElon Musk, the Space X CEO who has invested heavily in cryptos, and has been central to the success of Dogecoin, has some words of caution.\n\n\u201cI think people should not invest their live savings in Cryptocurrency,\u201d Musk told reporters in U.S. last week. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s unwise. But if you want to sort-of speculate that\u2019s fine. There is a good chance that crypto is the future currency of the earth, and we are like, which is it going to be? But it should be considered as a speculation at this point, so don\u2019t go too far.\u201d",

          "title": "Predatory Chinese loans still haunts Nigeria",
          "text": "Despite efforts by the financial authorities to downplay its magnitude, there continues to be some haunting concern in the public domain about Nigeria\u2019s burgeoning debt profile, and more so, the component of it owed foreign creditors, with that of China attracting even more quizzing interest, BH has confirmed.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt (external and domestic) currently stands at N32.2trn($84bn). Many analysts consider this quantum of debt a huge burden on the country. What is most challenging is it\u2019s servicing which gulps about 60% of the country\u2019s revenues. However, of the huge debt on the shoulders of Nigeria, the Country owes China over $3.7bn. In fact, some unconfirmed sources have put Nigeria\u2019s debt to China at between $5bn and $6bn presently.\n\nWhereas Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock is dangerously increasing by the day, discerning people are most worried by the country\u2019s increasing exposure to the Chinese Government. China as a country, experts say is reputed to adopt a predatory loans strategy to hold strategic national assets of any weak country it can hold down.\n\nEven Wikipedia describes China\u2019s Debt-trap diplomacy as a powerful lending country or institution seeking to saddle a borrowing nation with enormous debt so as to increase its leverage over it. The debt trap theory has in fact, become one the hottest debates in Africa including Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, many fear, may gradually be entering the Chinese debt trap and could be \u201closing\u201d its sovereignty to China over bad debts. Given that Nigerians are fast losing confidence in the governments\u2019 economic management strategy by the day, they are also not comforted by the fact that Chinese influence in Africa and Nigeria is on the increase.\n\nIndeed at a point, there had arisen a widespread and controversial narrative that the sovereign guarantee clause in loan agreements with China could see Nigeria sign away its sovereignty in the event of a payment default. Though there is no concrete proof to this effect, there are no doubts that agreements on Chinese loans appear not to have always been very clear and transparent.\n\nDespite Nigeria\u2019s Transportation minister, Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s attempt to clarify the purpose of the seemingly controversial clause and describe it as a waiver of immunity which would allow China pursue paths, including arbitration, to settle possible disputes over payments, many analysts believe China is smart and deliberate about its loan policies in Africa. There is a consensus that China understands the development deficit on the continent and it is strategically maneuvering this to wrap its arms around Africa\u2019s economic future.\n\nNotwithstanding China\u2019s embassy\u2019s own denial also of any plans to seize Nigerian assets in the event of any sovereign default, countries such as Zambia, Sri Lanka and Djibouti have reportedly already fallen into China\u2019s debt trap and are at the moment grossly discomforted.\n\nAnalysts believe that the government has a very poor economic management framework that is not domesticated for growth but that suppresses and heaps pain onto the citizenry. They add that they cannot figure out where the huge borrowings have been deployed for infrastructure.\n\nFor the Managing Director of HighCap Securities limited, Mr. David Adonri, the recourse to these external borrowings which are supposedly designated for the development of domestic infrastructure, in itself is a very wrong financing strategy. According to him, no well organised nation takes foreign loans to develop infrastructure.\n\n\u2018\u2019What you do is to take domestic loans or domestic borrowing, long term domestic borrowing. You do not even borrow from banks or whatever but you float instruments in the capital market to borrow to develop infrastructure. Infrastructure is a long term project so it requires long term financing to finance them.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019Those loans are very dangerous and can put the sovereignty of the country into jeopardy because Nigeria is not likely to have the export capacity to earn hard currency to repay those loans into the future. And the way those loans are structured are to be repaid far into the future, so the burden has been offloaded to the future generation who may not be willing to pay and may not have the resources to pay. So those creditors may come for Nigeria\u2019s assets to recover their loans so that is to the extent the Buhari of a man has mortgaged and is mortgaging the future of the country. He has already put Nigeria into a debt trap and made life unbearable for you and me. He has in fact come not only to destroy the present economic stability of the country but also the economic future of this country\u2019\u2019 he also said.\n\nRecently, it was reported that the Zambian government which is hugely indebted to China may have handed over the country\u2019s national electricity company, ZESCO to the Chinese due to the inability of Zambia to meet its loan repayment promises. China is, according to reports, already in control of the country\u2019s broadcasting company, ZNBC. There are also rumours that Zambia\u2019s main airport in Lusaka is also being targeted.\n\nRecently too, with more than $1 billion in debt to China, Sri Lanka released its port to companies owned by the Chinese government. Now Djibouti, home to the US military\u2019s main base in Africa, looks about to cede control of another key port to a Beijing-linked company, and the US is not happy about it.\n\nReports are that almost all major economies in sub-Saharan Africa today are massively indebted to China. And as days go by many more countries with poor economic projections that can service their debts join the numbers.\n\nReport reveal that about 72 percent of Kenya\u2019s $50bn bilateral debts are owed to China, with the East African country requesting an additional $3.8 billion extension. Nigeria also ramped up its debt to China by about $5billion China while Angola still owes about $212.2bn with a pending proposal for another $4.4 billion.\n\nSouth Sudan is reportedly owing over $14.5billion to China. The same condition applies weaker economies like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Ethiopia have also incurred large debt from China.\n\n\u2018\u2019The reality in these figures is that the majority of the beneficiary countries will not achieve the intended goals of the loans. This primarily because of corruption and poor economic structure\u2019\u2019, said an analyst\n\nAnalysts have warned Nigeria to be cautious before it falls into the same debt trap as Zambia.\n\n\u2018\u2019China has made its intentions to dominate the global economy clear enough for any serious mind to realize. It knows the enormous potentials Africa possesses, and it will go the extra length to utilize them for its selfish mission. Just like Europe did with colonialism\u2019\u2019, they explained.\n\nCHINA\u2019S LOAN USAGE\n\n\u2018\u2019The USD3.121 billion Loans are project-tied Loans. The projects, (eleven \u2013 11 in number as at March 31, 2020), include: Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Idu-Kaduna section), Abuja Light Rail Project, Nigerian Four Airport Terminals Expansion Project (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt), Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Lagos-Ibadan section) and Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Abuja \u2013 Keffi- Makurdi Road Project.\n\nThe impact of these Loans is not only evident but visible. For instance, the Idu \u2013 Kaduna Rail Line has become a major source of transportation between Abuja and Kaduna. Also, the new International Airport in Abuja, has improved air transportation for the populace, while the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan rail line when completed, will ease traffic on the busy Lagos -Ibadan Expressway.\n\nThe projects also have the added benefits of job creation, not only by themselves but through direct and indirect service providers, a number of which are Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\nIt is widely accepted that investment in infrastructure is one of the most effective tools for countries to achieve economic growth and development. Using Loans from China to finance infrastructure is thus in alignment with this position.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile the point has repeatedly been made that borrowing per se is not in itself offensive, the fact however remains that borrowing has to be strategic, targeted and ultimately value-driven to be substantially meaningful. Have the China loans passed the test? The jury is out.",

          "text": "BY ISAIAH BENJAMIN, Kaduna\n\nThe Southern Kaduna Joint Peace Committee (SKJPC) with support from the United States Agency for International Development \u2013 Nigeria Early Response Initiative (USAID-NERI) has indicated commitment to ensure that lasting peace is restored in various communities in Southern Kaduna.\n\nSouthern part of Kaduna State has been embroiled in various forms of communal crisis and attacks, which have led to, loss of lives and destruction of property in recent time.\n\nThe SKJPC which was inaugurated in September 2020, is a committee of five Muslims and five Christians carefully selected and inaugurated at the end of Southern Kaduna Peace Summit held at Throne room Kafanchan organised by the Nigerian Christians Pilgrim Commission (NCPC) under the leadership of its executive secretary, Rev. Yakubu Pam in conjunction with the Friends of Southern Kaduna, that included, Prof Suleiman Elias Bogoro, the executive secretary of TETFund. The summit had the blessings of the governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai.\n\nAddressing a press conference at the Kaduna State University (KASU) campus, the committee informed that the governor, Mallam El-Rufai has promised to work with them at all times to ensure that lasting peace is returned to Southern Kaduna.\n\nAccording to the text of the press conference which was read by Dr Ahmad Yande the co-chairman, the committee as part of its short-term activities has visited virtually all the chiefdoms and emirates in Southern Kaduna, met and addressed 21 chiefs and emirs with message of peace building and cordial relationship.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe text of the briefing which was jointly signed by Professor Benjamin K. Gugong (co-chairman), Dr Ahmad Yande (co-chairman), Alhaji Abdullahi A. Zubairu (co-secretary) and Reverend Dr Reuben Luka Turbi (co-secretary) reiterated that the committee is a product of a strong desire by the Southern Kaduna people to end all conflicts and ensure that peace reigns once more in Southern Kaduna.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s mandate is to ensure that there is sustained peace in all communities in Southern Kaduna. At the beginning of the committee\u2019s work, we held series of meetings in Kaduna to lay out a framework for constructive engagement, and we came up with short term, medium term and long-term activities to ease our work.\n\n\u201cWe argued that living together in peace, benefits us all and the region could overcome most of the social and economic problems it faces once there is peace. Our expectations are that the visit to the traditional rulers will open channels of communication, strengthen the skills needed to ensure peace, reestablishes local remediation and conflict resolution mechanisms in our communities.\n\n\u201cThe committee will like to appreciate the overwhelming support of USAID-NERI. In many communities in Kajuru, Jema\u2019a and Zango Kataf, USAID-NERI is working to restore peace by building houses that have been destroyed, installing solar street lights and drilling of bore holes in affected communities. Not only is the healing process very fast in communities that USAID-NERI is carrying out intervention, stakeholders have also been very sincere in their efforts for genuine peace,\u201d the committee stressed.\n\nRELATED: El-Rufai, Traditional Rulers Affirm Support For Peace In Southern Kaduna",

          "text": "By Tunde Oguntola, Abuja\n\nA sub-national Audit Efficacy Index 2020 has revealed that 18 States of the federation operate without Audit Law.\n\nThey are Adamawa, Kano, Kebbi, Kogi, Plateau, Benue, Kwara, Nasarawa, Sokoto, Taraba, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Abia, Ebonyi, Imo, Oyo, Bayelsa and Enugu states. They are with the least potent audit mechanisms in the country having scored below 50 per cent.\n\nThe report by Paradigm Leadership Support Initiative (PLSI), a civic organisation fostering accountability in Nigeria, assessed all 36 states of the federation against public finance management practices and accountability mechanisms leveraging on the role of public audit as a potent tool for improving efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of public spending.\n\nRecall that in 2015, the federal government approved the sum of $2.1bn to provide an intervention package to help bankrupt states in Nigeria pay salaries. While there has been increasing agitation for and against resource control, not much attention has been given to public finance management practices and accountability mechanisms in state and local levels.\n\nAlso, it would be recalled that some Nigerian states were unable to access a $700 million grant from the World Bank as they failed to publish their budget online.\n\nRelated: Nigeria Needs New Audit Law\n\nThe World Bank grants are non-repayable funds disbursed or given by one party, often a government department, corporation, foundation or trust, to a recipient, often (but not always) a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business or an individual.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBasically, public audit no doubt plays a significant role in improving government\u2019s spending and revenue capacity by limiting fiscal behaviors that result in waste, misallocation or misappropriation and corruption. It is important to recognize the impact of sub-national audit which is aimed at strengthening public finance management and accountability structures at state and local levels as is the practice at the national level.\n\nSub-national audit and other public finance accountability measures are not only crucial for good governance and development but particularly important to the fiscal health condition of state and local governments.\n\nThe inability of public audit to yield intended benefit as provided for in section 125 of the 1999 constitution as amended cannot be separated from the maximum control of the executive arm over the legislature and judiciary at sub-national level.\n\nIt is therefore important to allow democratic institutions at state and local levels to function effectively so that public resources can be adequately accounted for.\n\nAddressing a virtual press briefing on Monday on sub-national Audit Efficacy Index 2020, the communications associate, PLSI, Adebisi Adeshakin, said the inability of State Assemblies\u2019 Public Accounts Committees (PACs) to issue recommendations based on their review of reports of auditor-general\u2019s is negatively impacting the public audit eco-system particularly at sub-national level which in turn hindering accountability in the management of public funds.\n\nThe report highlighted \u201ctwelve states including Delta, Jigawa, Kaduna, Lagos, Niger, and Rivers as states with the most potent audit process in Nigeria having scored 70/100. Also, Anambra, Borno, Yobe, Katsina and Gombe occupied 13th position with 60/100 as their score while the 2020 index ranked Oyo, Sokoto, Imo, Benue among others 25th with 40 per cent score point and Enugu as a state with the least potent audit mechanisms having scored 20/100 and ranked 36th.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe report said the lack of independence of the legislative arm of government at sub-national level is a cause for concern and this is evident by the recent call for legislative and judicial autonomy across the 36 States of the federation.\n\nSimilarly, it said the failure on the part of sub-national audit institutions to allow for citizens\u2019 participation in the audit process renders audit functions inadequate and unable to facilitate sustainable development.\n\nIt lamented that it was disappointing to know that 50 per cent of states including Sokoto, ImoOsun, Benue, and Anambra do not have modern audit laws that should guarantee independence of the auditor-general in their states and enhance effective stakeholder involvement in their audit process.\n\nThe report, however, noted that some states including Zamfara, Delta, Kano and Edo are showing progress, having enacted modern audit laws and should be encouraged to do more.\n\nAlso, Delta state is among the very few if not the only state that has published an audit report on COVID-19 interventions.\n\nIn the report, Enugu State has the least potent audit mechanisms having scored 20/100 and ranked 36th.\n\nPresenting the latest report during a virtual briefing, PLSI executive director, Olusegun Elemo, explained the methodology adopted in the assessment exercise.\n\nHe said that \u201cPLSI undertook data integrity exercises to ensure that information used in assessing efficacy of public audit in each state were drawn from reliable sources. certain evaluation criteria were employed in arriving at the SAE index 2020 and data used fulfilled certain conditions to qualify as a valid data.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SAE index 2020 was assessed using each sub-national entity\u2019s fiscal information, legal framework, and stakeholder involvement in the public audit cycle. We standardized data sources to a scale of 0-100 where 0 equals the lowest level and 100 equals the highest level of audit capacity to produce the intended result of ensuring that public funds are adequately accounted for.\n\n\u201cThis standardization was done by aggregating scores due from all stages of assessment which include availability (publicly) of financial statement/audited financial statement/audit report, operationalization of a modern or obsolete audit legal framework, legislative involvement in the audit process, executive actions on audit recommendations, and level of citizens participation in the audit process.\u201d",

This can only happen under the watch of an absentee president, who also condone corruption,\u201d the opposition party stated",

          "text": "By Tom Okpe\n\nMinority Caucus in the House of Representatives is alarmed by the alleged looting of over N165 billion operating surplus as well as other diverted funds running into billions of naira, by top officials of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), calling for the nations\u2019 anti-graft body to investigate the Organization.\n\nThe lawmakers described as \u2018another sad commentary on the brimming corruption in the APC administration,\u2019 mindless lootings of such stupendous resources at a time the country was writhing in the throes of worsening insecurity.\n\nIt, therefore asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to immediately take in the indicted Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, and commence a system-wide investigation with a view to prosecuting her, if found wanting.\n\nThe Caucus in a statement signed by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu (PDP Delta) on Monday, insisted that such huge economic crime against the nation should not be left to an administrative panel of enquiry, but committed to an anti-graft agency for independent investigation.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers expressed concern that by committing the alleged NPA looting to an administrative panel, political manipulations and partisan influences had taken precedence over what should have been a system-wide investigation into a monumental fraud.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the recourse to an administrative, instead of a full-scale criminal investigation can nly serve as decoy to shield some other APC government officials involved in the looting spree at NPA and other affiliated agencies in the transport sector.\n\n\u201cApart from the unremitted N165 billion cited by the Minister, other documents and reports from the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation had also uncovered several sleaze, including unremitted deduction to Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) amounting to N3,667,750,470. $148,845,745.04, Euro 4,891,449.50 and \u00a3252,682.14.\n\n\u201cOur Caucus holds that the mere suspension of the indicted Managing Director of the NPA, Hadiza Bala Usman, and the resort to an administrative panel of enquiry even after the report by the Supervising Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, exposed an unremitted and possibly diverted operating surplus of N165 billion, amounts to romancing and perfuming corruption by the APC-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to audit query of N15.18 billion allegedly stolen through inflated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects/programmes under the watch of the suspended NPA Managing Director.\n\nREAD ALSO: Eddie Hearn confirms Anthony Joshua vs Tyson Fury will be announced this week\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the suffering people of Nigeria, our Caucus is particularly very worried that such monumental lootings are going on at a time terrorists, bandits, unknown gunmen, and criminal militias are reigning supreme across the length and breath of the country and life has consequently become the cheapest article in the country.\n\n\u201cWe imagine that such resources if channelled to the security sector and well managed would have made a world of difference in addressing the problem of insecurity in the country,\u201d the caucus stated.\n\nIt further stressed that the APC administration had crippled the national economy and brought untold hardship and suffering to Nigerians, therefore demanded more drastic step by anti-graft agencies to recover the stolen funds as well as prosecute all, involved in the looting spree.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that a party that came to power with the promise of fighting corruption, build the economy, and fight insecurity has ended up destroying whatever gains that were made before it came to power.\u201d",

This year\u2019s march is also taking place in the final days of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe past few days have seen the worst violence in the city for years.\n\nMore than 300 Palestinians were wounded in the confrontations with Israeli police outside the Al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe latest violence follows days of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in the nearby Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem, with the possible eviction of Palestinian families from their homes there by Jewish settlers a focal point for Palestinian anger.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Supreme Court had been due to hold a hearing in the long-running case on Monday, but the session was postponed due to the trouble.",

          "text": "Suspended managing director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala Usman says media reports claiming she solely awarded ports contract during her tenure is irresponsible and mischievous.\n\nMs Usman stated this in a statement she personally signed on Sunday in which she staunchly denied claims that she\u2019s involved in a \u201cclandestine ploy to short-change a company\u201d in favour of Africa\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote. Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari last week approved the suspension of Bala Usman as the managing director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) on the recommendation of the minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and approved the appointment of Mohammed Koko pending the outcome of an investigation into the maritime sector. According to Usman, the NPA has an executive management team, which always considers and takes business decisions on all assets of the NPA in the best interest of the country.\n\n\u201cTo claim that I singlehandedly awarded a contract in my capacity as Managing Director, is, therefore, irresponsible, mischievous, and defamatory,\u201d she said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThe report also mischievously lumped the now expired service boat contract between the NPA and the Integrated Logistics Services\u2019 (INTELs), which took off in 2007 with a review of a ten-year extension in 2011 to culminate in expiration in August 2020 with the lease under discussion.\n\n\u201cThe service boat contract expired through the effluxion of time and the Authority initiated a procurement process in which INTELs participated in line with all extant laws.\u201d\n\nShe also denied any involvement in a secret plan to short-change a company in favour of Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man. The statement read: \u201cThis report is false, without any foundation and a figment of some wild imagination of the news platform. \u201cI also note the insinuation of a non-existent monetary transfer between Alhaji Dangote and I during the 2015 elections. As I told People\u2019s Gazette when I was approached about this story, no such transaction occurred. \u201cHaving gone through the trouble to give this explanation, I demand that Sahara Reporters publish this rebuttal and give it the same measure of prominence given to the false story, which runs against all known ethics of journalism.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the Authority realised that INTELs had neither been making these payments for five years nor putting the berths to optimal use.\n\n\u201cThe Authority then wrote INTELs to request for the payment of the arrears of monies that were unpaid and expand the utilisation of the facility.\n\n\u201cWith the continued under-utilisation of the facility, the fact that there was no contractual agreement with INTELs from the outset and the urgent need to decongest the ports in Lagos, the Authority offered the berths to an internationally renowned container handling company, Messers International Container Terminal Nigerian Limited (ICTNL) for the use of the berths for container cargo discharging.\n\n\u201cICTNL has signed a contract for the lease of the berths with the Authority and has commenced the installation of container handling equipment when INTELS instituted a court action challenging the withdrawal of the offer. That case is still in court!\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

The Muslim calendar follows lunar cycles and the Eid holiday depends on the sighting of the new moon.\n\nJust hours after the pending cease-fire was announced, a bus in southern Zabul province struck a roadside mine killing 11 people, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian. At least 24 more people on the bus were injured. Improvised explosive devices litter the countryside and have been used extensively by the Taliban.\n\nTaliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said Taliban fighters have been ordered to stop all offensives, \u201cto provide a peaceful and secure atmosphere to our compatriots . . . so that they may celebrate this joyous occasion with a greater peace of mind.\u201d\n\nThe cease-fire announcement comes amid heightened violence in the country and follows a brutal attack on a girls\u2019 school on Saturday that killed as many 60 people, most of them students between 11-15 years old. The death toll from the three explosions continues to climb.\n\nThe Taliban denied any responsibility and condemned the attack, which occurred in the mostly Shiite neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi in the west of the capital.\n\nAttacks in the area are most often claimed by the Afghan Islamic State affiliate, but no group yet has claimed the attack on the school.\n\nThe cease-fire announcement also comes as the US and NATO are withdrawing the last of their military forces.
