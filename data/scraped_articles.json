          "title": "IGP Alkali vows to improve public safety",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Emma Nnadozie, Crime Editor\n\nThere were echoes of war in the South East before he was appointed the Acting Inspector-General of Police. The situation was such that policemen went about their lawful duties in mufti.\n\nThey were also restricted in areas of operation as a result of attacks from gun men who invaded police stations, set them on fire, killed and maimed officers and men.\n\nUsman Baba Alkali had his first baptism of fire at the Police headquarters in Imo state. The hoodlums had attacked the nearby correctional center, released incarcerated criminals and set the place on fire. Thereafter, they invaded the nearby Police Command headquarters and unleashed mayhem. Not done, they also wrought more havoc by burning adjoining buildings in the area. Shockingly, they operated freely for hours in an area surrounded with security men including the police.\n\nREAD ALS: Mbaka opens up on his detention as Bishop calls for prayers on his violent followers\n\nThe hoodlums then proceeded to the home of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodinmma, burnt his cars and part of his magnificent palatial home and killed the policemen who were on official duty there. Tragically, the ugly trend continued with more killings, looting and burning of police formations including the newly established Zone 13, Ukpo in Anambra state.\n\nThere were also pockets of attacks at police formations and stations in Abia, Ebonyi, Enugu and other states in the South East. In fact, the then Inspector general of Police, Adamu Muhammed went to Imo state to see things for himself before he retired while Deputy Inspector General of Police, DIG, Usman Baba Alkali was announced as the Acting IGP on 7th April, 2021.\n\nUpon his assumption of duties, Alkali took the bull by the horn by effecting changes in the leadership of the police in the areas with a view to strengthening their workforce and putting a permanent stop to the horrific stories being told from the east.\n\nThe changes manifested in the immediate posting of commissioner of Police, Christopher A. Owolabi as the new Commissioner of Police (CP) in charge of Anambra State Police Command. Acting IGP alkali stated unequivocally that the deployment of the new CP was part of the ongoing efforts at re-ordering, overhauling and strengthening the security and policing architecture in Anambra State and other states of the South-East and South-South geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThis, according to him, was ultimately designed to improve the operational efficiency of the command and enhance public safety and security. CP Chris Owolabi took over from CP Monday Bala Kuryas, who was redeployed to the Anti-Fraud Section of the Force Headquarters Annex, Lagos.\n\nIn a similar vein, the IGP ordered the posting of other strategic and tactical commanders within the zones. A total of two Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs), 14 Assistant Commissioners of Police and other mid-level officers were affected.\n\nHe charged the new Commissioner of Police in Anambra State to take adequate measures in consolidating and improving on the gains of his predecessor and further charged the CP to rejig the security apparatus of the state, harness the full potential of the command \u2013 its workforce, assets and stakeholders \u2013 in advancing the collective safety of all citizens.\n\nThe IGP equally enjoined the people of South-East and South-South zones to cooperate with the police and other security agencies to enable them succeed in the responsibilities of safeguarding them. Also, IGP Alkali ordered the posting of CP Abutu Yaro to Imo State as the new Commissioner of Police. CP Yaro was the immediate Commissioner of police in Zamfara state where banditry was raging and he was reputed to have put in his best in tackling the issue. His posting to Imo state was in furtherance of efforts by the Police leadership towards strengthening security, tackling violent crimes and enhancing optimal coordination of policing operations within the state and beyond.\n\nWhile the postings were taking place with firm promise of effecting more, the police in Ebonyi state intercepted 753 high caliber GPMG ammunition and recovered two AK47 rifles, five Pump Action Guns, six pistols and other weapons from Abakaliki.\n\nThe recovery which was made possible by the new security architecture set up by the Acting IGP assisted police in the area to intercept the ammunitions concealed in a sack being transported in a commercial vehicle from Abakaliki, Ebonyi State to Umuahia in Abia State.\n\nThe intelligence-driven covert operation, which led to the interception and recovery of the deadly ammunition, was part of efforts by the force to identify and crack down on criminal networks and supply chains for weapons and ammunition in and around the country.\n\nBased on the new operational policy and tactical approach as directed by IGP Alkali, Enugu state police command, also swooped on the den of suspected kidnappers and killed a yet-to-be-identified suspects along Udi-Oji River Road during a gun duel with officers attached to Udi police division. The command also arrested one 26-year-old Samuel Felix suspected to be an armed robber along Akwuke Road, Gariki, Enugu.\n\nPolice sources said the operations were carried out in synergy with the personnel of the vigilante groups in the said locations, adding that two cut-to-size locally-made double barrel guns, charm and other exhibits were recovered during the operations.\n\nIt was gathered that irked by the prevailing security situation in the country, the IGP has also directed all Commissioners of Police to stop collecting bribe or mounting road blocks in order to make money.\n\nHe also charged them to ensure that policemen under their respective commands do not violate the law of the land where they were serving assuring that he was ready to fight, protect and assist hardworking officers and men who do not depend on money collected from road block and other practices which can tarnish the image of the force.\n\nWhile charging the newly posted officers to bring to bear their professional experience in improving policing and restoring public confidence in their new places of assignment, he assured citizens of the determination of the force under his leadership to upscale its operations, improve public safety and tackle all forms of crimes in the country.\n\nThe new IGP, who is the 21st indigenous Inspector General of Police, a fellow of the National Defence College hails from Geidam in Yobe state. He was commissioned into the Nigeria Police Force on 15th March, 1988 as a Cadet Assistant Superintendent of Police at the Nigeria Police Academy (Annex), Kaduna. He holds a Masters degree in Public Administration (MPA) and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science.\n\nAn astute crime-fighter and versatile manager of men and resources, he has held several strategic positions in the past cutting across all the departments of the Force. These include: Ag. Deputy Inspector-General of Police in-charge of the Department of Finance and Administration, the Force Secretary, Assistant Inspector-General of Police in-charge of Zone-5 Benin, Zone-4 Makurdi and Zone-7 Abuja. He was also a former Commissioner of Police, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Delta Commands amongst others.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

In an encounter with Saturday Sun, the Ozubulu-Anambra State-born Ekezie couldn\u2019t hide her frustrations.\n\nShe confessed: \u201cI\u2019m not into any serious relationship right now. I\u2019m single and available! My kind of man? I\u2019m not bothered about physical look but you wouldn\u2019t be looking like a masquerade either. I want a good-looking guy, with average (height).

So, a lot of actors are pressured by society. Nigerians are conflicted; they want you to be humble, then the next minute, they complain that you are too modest. Women often create these problems.

          "title": "Those around Buhari are leading him the wrong way \u2013Ahamba",
          "text": "Elder statesman and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ahamba has accused those around President Muhammadu Buhari of leading him down the wrong path.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, Ahamba also reminded the Igbo not to expect anyone to donate the presidency to them in 2023, even as he charged them to go all out and fight to make an Igbo man president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nMany people conclude that the Buhari government has failed. You were an associate of Buhari, or you worked with him sometime ago. Is this the Buhari you knew? What do you think changed?\n\nThe difference is that, we wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen, but those who got into government with him allowed it to happen. This is the Buhari I knew, but the problem is the people surrounding him, who want him to go the wrong way. When we were with him, we all wanted him to go the right way, but ethnic interests informed the exit of some of us because some people around him didn\u2019t allow some of us to remain with him because they know we would intervene and would not allow such things to happen. I had no quarrel with him. We didn\u2019t disagree on anything. We were just manipulated out.\n\nINEC has released the election timetable for the 2023 general elections. Some are saying certain parts of the country, like the South-East, should have it, while some others think otherwise. What is your candid opinion on this?\n\nMy candid opinion is that in this type of situation where there is no provision about rotation in the constitution, the interest of the nation demands that each part of Nigeria be given a chance. It is on that ground that I said it is best if the South-East is given a chance, not as of right, but in terms of equity and to bring peace and justice to the country.\n\nWhether they will do it or not depends on how they vote on that day. Let the candidates from South-East who want to be president move out as others are moving out and let us start assessing them. It cannot be donated. Nobody will donate presidency to the South-East. You have to fight for it. But I have not seen any candidate yet.\n\nNigeria is witnessing very challenging times, with insecurity in many parts of the country. What gave rise to this?\n\nThere is complacency in governance. Not hitting the iron while it was hot is a reason for this problem. Delay of action is dangerous, so we are just having the result of delay of action. These things have shown that they will happen in the last two or three years. Nobody did anything about them and they matured.\n\nPeople are saying that with the high level of insecurity, 2023 elections may not hold. If that comes to being what is the implication, because the tenure of this government elapses by 2023?\n\nMy granddaughter was asked by her grandmother what happened about something. The little girl asked the grandmother ,\u2018am I God?\u2019 How will I know what will happen, am I God? Let\u2019s see whether it holds or not.\n\nThen what is the legal implication if it doesn\u2019t hold?\n\nThere are provisions in the constitution about that. When that time comes, I think the Attorney General will give the relevant advice, while private lawyers will challenge or support the advice.\n\nThe Federal Government is alleging that there is a plot to overthrow the government of President Buhari. Is this a pointer that the APC government is not doing well or might have fallen out of favour with the people?\n\nThe government wants to create an opportunity to destabilise the opposition by making them suspects of a non-existence offence. That is all. I don\u2019t know what type of a security organ that will tell you that there is a plot to topple government, instead of getting ready to nip it in the bud. Last year December, there was crisis over the invasion of the Capitol in Washington DC. The security arm discovered it and reported to the appropriate body and they nipped it in the bud and it never happened.\n\nHere, we now shout it so that we can arrest innocent people and demand money from them. We have a problem in this country. If they were sharp enough to discover that there was a plot, you nip it in the bud; you don\u2019t go and allow it to happen so that you can punish people or start punishing people without it happening. I learnt the other day they were saying that they would be arresting probable people planning to destabilise the state; that they will start arresting them at home. So, if I\u2019m in my house and you are in your house and you stay there and imagine that I\u2019m plotting something, you will come to my house and arrest me because I\u2019m planning to do what is in my mind. I\u2019m a lawyer, and I know that you don\u2019t talk about a thing until a step is taken relevant to that offence you said happened.\n\nIf there is anarchy everywhere and people are complaining, is that a plot? Even the person giving the warning has seen that there is trouble. Why is he saying that somebody wants to create trouble? Can we create a worse trouble than the one we have now? All this is a mark of incompetence; they should put competent people in place. A lot of square pegs have been forced into round holes, which is part of the problems we have in this nation.\n\nSome Igbo people say, based on what the country is passing through under President Buhari, that they have been vindicated for not voting for him all along, even when he had Igbo running mates. Do you share same sentiments?\n\nDid he score 100 per cent in other places? He didn\u2019t, which means that there were Hausa-Fulani who didn\u2019t vote for him. The issue was that, who was the candidate? They preferred a candidate. It has nothing to do with ethnic or anything. At that time, they preferred a candidate to him. It is not a question of being vindicated because you didn\u2019t vote for Buhari; I reject that because I\u2019m an Igbo man, a prominent one for that matter. It was not true that anybody was against him. The issue I think was a preferred candidate at that material time and I campaigned against that position at that time. It is a political game; there is no vindication about it at all.\n\nEven when he had great Igbo men and others like you and his running mates who were also Igbo?\n\nIt depends on who he chose as running mates. Maybe if he had chosen other persons as running mates, it could have been better. I remember at that time there was hardly an election; votes were declared even when voting was going on. That was the era. I did the election petition and I have the documents; if you challenge me, I will bring the documents.\n\nDo you mean that Buhari could have won that election?\n\nEven if he did not win, he was not fairly treated at those elections.\n\nWhen you open pages or newspapers, the social media, what you read is, Nigeria is breaking up, or Nigeria will break up? Why are we having such fears at this time when other nations are conquering other planets?\n\nBreaking up of Nigeria, is it a plate? It is not easy to break up. Nigeria can disintegrate, everybody going his own way because the centre cannot hold. It is true that our constitution says that Nigeria is indissoluble. Whether it is dissoluble or indissoluble is a human act towards a project. That one may never happen, but disintegration is uncontrolled, but that shouldn\u2019t occupy our minds. What should occupy our minds is what to do to prevent it and move forward. Look at India, when I was in secondary school, they used to come here with degrees and we employed them in our secondary schools and paid them higher school salaries and now, we are running there for many things. What is wrong with us?\n\nAre you sure a worst Nigeria will not come into the disintegrated areas? You can disintegrate and in each component you have a good portion of Nigeria attitude inside it. It is the same thing. There may be worst Nigeria in the disintegrated areas. So let us solve it now that we are together. I believe that the only answer is to allow the areas some air of ability to do things for themselves at their own rate, not saying that the whole Nigeria must move at the same rate every time. Take for example, people say they want true federation, but they want salary to be the same everywhere. It can\u2019t happen in a true federation. It is not possible for some states to pay what Lagos can pay; some states cannot pay what Rivers or Kano states can pay. In a true federation, things should be according to those areas, but the Nigerian Labour Congress said it would destabilise Nigeria if you go to true federation with labour matters. People say they want true federation, yet they want the Federal Government to fund local governments while the states create the local governments. This is incongruous. If we want true federalism, we will have it. If we don\u2019t want, we continue with what I call \u2018unitary federalism\u2019 which is a new trend in politics.\n\nIn this direction, are you calling for restructuring, but many are still confused over how it is going to be carried out?\n\nI stand for restructuring; I don\u2019t stand for secession of any part of Nigeria. Let us restructure and go back to our federation agreement. We agreed on certain things before we became a federation. Let us revisit those things and see the ones we can take now and there will be peace in this place.\n\nWhen the current leadership says restructuring is not an option, what other options do we have?\n\nWe keep crying and trying to get it right, but in the end, we may come to Chinua Achebe, \u2018Things Fall Apart\u2019 and in another book, \u2018The Centre Cannot Hold\u2019. When the centre cannot hold, things will fall apart.\n\nAs it is in Nigeria today, what are the consequences of things falling apart?\n\nIt portends anarchy because before instability, there will be anarchy. We can ill afford that.\n\nSome people hold the view that Britain is the architect of our woes. They say Nigeria remains the last experiment of the British government, as other nations they brought together have gone their separate ways, each enjoying peace. They mention India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and others. What do you say to this?\n\nI agree, but what we don\u2019t know is why they decided to remain together when others were going their ways, because there is nothing happening now that the leadership of those days didn\u2019t see. Look, Southern Cameroun was part of Nigeria and they quickly eased themselves off, but the others remained together. I asked at the National Conference that our elders have not told us why they remained together when others were going their ways. Until we get that question answered, we may not know why they continued. If you look at the constitution, you find out that as at the time we got independent, regions have prime ministers, not premiers and they have their own governors, apart from governors general. They had their own constitution, but in 1978, some people went to the Constituent Assembly. I don\u2019t know whether they understood what they were doing. They said they were creating a federal constitution and they said there is only one constitution, the national constitution. There we became a unitary federalism and now we are crying. We were doing parliamentary system, but they said it is presidential they wanted. When you have to send people for something, you send people that know the issue, but you find good tailors and good carpenters who know nothing about law being sent to constitutional conferences. I do not know what we have now that was not there then. What we have to do now is to find a solution. Let\u2019s stop talking of how we came to this point; let us find a solution to our present circumstance and find out how we can remain together because if we split in a disorganised manner, it will be very bad.\n\nTalking about the 1999 Constitution, many people argue that what was agreed on is not what we have in the constitution. They said then Head of State, Abdulasam Abubakar handed over the document to Prof Awual Yadudu, who doctored it and produced what we have now.\n\nI don\u2019t like this lamentation about the 1999 Constitution. It is 99 per cent of what was in the 1979 Constitution. Before you complain of the 1999 Constitution, you have to first complain of the 1979 Constitution. If the problem started with the 1979 Constitution, why do you allow it to continue in 1999? Who did you send to the Constituent Assembly? I keep saying it, why would you send people who don\u2019t know anything about constitution to represent you in a constitutional conference? Everything is political and here we are today. The question of accepting the 1979 Constitution and holding the 1999 Constitution as fraud is not acceptable to me because they are the same. If people scampered to go and occupy offices based on the constitution, why did they go there instead of rejecting the constitution and face the military? Silence is acceptance.\n\nBut when Obasanjo came into power, one of his advisers said as the military has been eased off, their next plan was to work on an acceptable constitution. But that never came to pass?\n\nIt is not easy. Those who said that never knew how tedious it is making a constitution in a civilian regime; it is not as easy as making it under a military regime. In an undeveloped country like ours where everything is selfishly considered, not nationally considered, it is not easy. It was a wrong move to accept it first and then reject it later. That was a cowardly approach to a situation.\n\nHow do we move forward?\n\nThe National Assembly has power to make laws for peace, order and good government in Nigeria. That is their jurisdiction. They should make a law creating a constitutional conference or a constituent assembly to give us another constitution. We need to sit down and discuss our problem. We need to sit and discuss this situation of somebody having the power to make appointment of one ethnic group, a minority for that matter, for the whole country. The National Assembly should know its responsibility. When a president or governor begins to act contrary to the constitution, they have a duty to remove him from office. But what do we have now? It is our party; it is not our party. They go there to worship party and not the peace, good, order of government that the constitution asks them to do. I can\u2019t do anything about that. I will only complain as I have been complaining. Where I see such a thing I will speak out and go back to my house. If we follow 60 per cent of what is in that constitution, there will be peace in Nigeria.\n\nYou said the National Assembly should make a law to set up a constitutional conference or constituent assembly that will midwife a new constitution. But they said there is no need for that as they were already there to amend the constitution.\n\nThey have no power to amend the constitution. Go to Section Nine, the word, \u2018alter\u2019. Not to alter or amend the constitution; they can alter any provision of the constitution but not to alter or amend the constitution. If you say there is no difference between alteration and amendment, it is not true. It is just like saying that there is no difference between epidemic and pandemic. One contains the other; they are not the same. They think they are doing the right thing, but they are derailing. All these going around in the name of constitutional amendments are just a waste of time.",

          "title": "Untold story of Rev Fr. Mbaka",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nFiery Catholic priest, Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka is in the eye of the storm. Thousands of worshipers and members of his Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), on Wednesday, took to the streets of Enugu in violent protest over the sudden disappearance of their Spiritual Director.\n\nAt the end of the protest, which lasted over four hours, property belonging to the Catholic Church, including the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, were destroyed.\n\nThe protest, which had never been witnessed in the state almost, led to anarchy in the town. It was quelled when the \u2018missing\u2019 Mbaka reappeared in a black SUV at about 2.50pm, urging his followers to go back to their homes or the Adoration Ground, that he was safe.\n\nBut before then, the residence of the bishop had been vandalized; windows were shattered while air conditioners were damaged. Even water installations were not spared. It took the intervention of some individuals to stop the house from being set ablaze.\n\nMbaka has been in the public eye for quite some time. In 2014, he had prophesised that General Muhammadu Buhari, then presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would defeat former President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 polls.\n\nHis prophecy drew the ire of many, especially in the old Eastern region where Jonathan had teeming supporters.\n\nBarely three years later, he spoke vehemently against the same Buhari\u2019s government that he had prayed for. He warned Nigerian leaders of a looming disaster, which he said would be sparked by the unmitigated bloodletting in the country, while calling on the President to go to Rome to atone for the human carnage going on in the country under his watch.\n\n\u201cSupernatural disaster is coming. Angels are already warming up. Nigerians should not worry; one day there will be vacancy from Abuja. The jet will park and nobody will use it unless they repent.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, had it been that it was the Imams that were killed in Benue or Plateau, the president would have attended their burials.\n\n\u201cGod can prophesy someone into a position. If you know how Nebuchadnezzar became the President. He went there under prophetic order. When God wants to punish His people, He can use a leader. The Nebucadnezzar God later pushed into the bush.\u201d\n\nHe further said that President Buhari was like an egg that was bound to meet a sledgehammer in the nearest future, charging those who were close to the president to ensure he got his message.\n\nHe called himself a microphone speaking as directed by God warning that anybody who would want to attack him because of the message would meet his waterloo.\n\nThat is Rev. Father Camillus Ejike Mbaka, Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry of Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nArguably, one of the most unconventional Catholic priests in Nigeria; Mbaka\u2019s methods and tactics have endeared him to many, with thousands of followers trooping to the adoration ground located at Umuchigbo, Iji Nike; Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State for spiritual encounter every Friday. For all the followership, Mbaka is no stranger to controversies; he rather seems at home with them. No wonder one can hardly think of any other priest that divides opinion more than the charismatic priest.\n\nIn fact, Mbaka said during the first physical service of his church after about five months of closure due to lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic that the country goes \u2018gaga\u2019 anytime he declares prophecies.\n\nHe said, \u201cLike you know, whenever we declare a prophecy here, the whole country goes gaga and they begin to plan evil. But woe betides whoever that should allow himself to be used to try any attack on me or this ministry.\n\n\u201cYou may not like me; I may not be among those you consider as good people, but I know that God is using me to save people and minister succour to mankind.\u201d\n\nFamily background and journey to priesthood\n\nFr. Mbaka is the only son of late Chief Humphrey and Felicia Mbaka. He hails from Amata Ituku in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Humphrey Mbaka\u2019s family stood out for their special talent in palm wine tapping in the community. Ejike as a child helped his father in his palm wine business. He was also close to his mother as he always helped out in domestic chores.\n\nDespite the demand of domestic activities, the young Mbaka also devoted time to Block Rosary. He stood out as one of the leaders of the group at St. Anthony\u2019s Parish, Ituku where he led the prayer team. His father, who was a traditional religion worshipper, seemed to have tolerated his tilt to Christianity until he declared his intention to enter priesthood. This was met with stiff resistance by his late father who allegedly made life a living hell for the intending priest.\n\nMbaka attended St. Vincent\u2019s Secondary School, Agbogugu in Awgu L.G.A of Enugu State, from where he proceeded to the Seat of Wisdom Seminary, Owerri, Imo State and St Joseph\u2019s Seminary Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom State, for his training as a priest. He was ordained a priest on July 29, 1995 and was subsequently posted to Holy Ghost Cathedral, headquarters of Catholic Church in Enugu Diocese as the Assistant Diocesan Administrator.\n\nHe later ventured out on evangelical missions to Capuchin; a religious order of Franciscan friars within the Catholic Church, and Government Technical College (GTC), Enugu, where he founded the Word Prayer Centre of the Eucharistic Jesus which later metamorphosed to the Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nIt was gathered that those early years of priesthood were unbearable for Mbaka as he would hold Mass at the GTC and shortly after the service; the church leadership would come and retrieve the offering. He was not allowed access to the offering; neither was he given accommodation.\n\nAt some point, he lived with a couple in their one-room apartment in the GRA; and most times slept in the car. It was from there that some members who saw the efficacy of his prayers rented a place for him before they eventually commenced putting up structures for the Christ the King\u2019s Parish (CKP), which hosted the adoration ground at the GRA.\n\nHuge crowds troop to the adoration ground every Friday from all parts of the country in search of spiritual encounter. The atmosphere is usually charged and electrifying such that one gets the exact buzz that goes with the Pentecostal fellowships.\n\nAccording to one of the choristers in the ministry, Oluchi Okolo, the singers usually have their works cut out for them as they are expected to sing and keep everyone \u201cin the realm of the spirit\u201d until the man of God arrives. She said once the man of God is sighted, the atmosphere becomes more intense and shouts of \u201cDaddy\u201d, \u201cOga Ndi Oga\u201d, \u201cNwa Ikuku\u201d, \u201c Onyeisi Okanga\u201d, \u201cOga Emma\u201d, and so many other appendages with which Mbaka is known rend the air. She described the feeling as blissful.\n\nThe all-night service proper at the Adoration Ground can best be described as Pentecostal-Catholicism. Without being told, a first time visitor will think he was in a Pentecostal gathering until it was time for the Holy Communion and the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDescribing worship at the Adoration Ground, an observer wrote: \u2018Worship here combines preaching, ecstatic Eucharistic adoration, two Masses, anointing and dance in a way that is hard to imagine for anyone who has not seen it before. Mbaka is a celebrity and a force in the entire South East region, supported by many followers and clergy.\u2019\n\nHowever, in 2016, Mbaka was transferred from the CKP where he had presided for 20 years to Our Lady\u2019s Catholic Church, Emene; a small parish in an obscure part of Enugu as an assistant priest.\n\nHis exit from CKP on January 31, 2016 was a highly emotional exercise as he was escorted by thousands of Catholic faithful in Enugu to his new parish.\n\nSeveral lorries, buses and cars all lined the street in what could be dubbed a triumphal exit that halted economic and other activities for over four hours along major streets where the long convoy passed.\n\nAddressing the crowd before the movement, Mbaka had expressed reservations over the transfer, which he said was calculated to make him suffer by certain leaders of the church.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know we are going to suffer within now and few months to come. I am going to suffer and suffer; I know that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to suffer because I have no place to put my head. I am going to suffer because I have no place to keep the Adoration Ministry\u2019s assets. I know I\u2019m going to suffer.\n\n\u201cFortunately, it is going to happen in the month of lent. So, I am going to use my exit here as a Lenten observance./ but Jesus said it all in John 16:20 to his apostles that you will be sorrowful and the world will be rejoicing but very soon I will turn your sorrow to joy.\n\n\u201cThe quantum of the assets of the Adoration Ministry is the only thing I am bothered about for now. Where am I going to keep them? I am going to stay in one small room that has only one small bed, one small table, little toilet and bathroom.\n\n\u201cSo, where am I going to keep all the Adoration assets? My clothing and books I can keep in the car or somebody\u2019s house but where will I keep these assets that I have given to the Catholic Church of Enugu? But I say may God take the glory and whoever that has offended me, I have forgiven.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fight anybody or even dream of battling anybody. If anybody allows the devil to use him, the same that advised you to make a mistake will laugh at you when you cry over the error. The baby is born, there is no going back.\n\n\u201cWe are moving out. We have been doing it and we will do it again.\u201d\n\nActually, many had thought that heavens would fall over the transfer. The manner the whole thing died down attracted the envy of former Vice President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop John Praise Daniel who extolled the legendary discipline in the orthodox Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cI know if it were in a Pentecostal church, a church would have started the following day. A man with over 30, 000 worshippers still agreed to leave everything to one small church. It\u2019s discipline,\u201d he had remarked.\n\nLife of giving\n\nIn early 2020, Fr. Mbaka shocked both his followers and non-followers alike when he disclosed that he spends about $2 million (over N700 million) monthly on charity works. The priest through his Multi-Live Savers for the Less Privileged has positively changed the lives of many indigent persons nationwide.\n\nDuring the event marking his 25th year of priestly ordination, one of his followers, Anita Ogonna, praised him saying: \u201cFr Mbaka, you are not a saint or the best among all, but I respect you so much in all your physical and spiritual doings, you are a man who converted his money for private jet to give many poor people a home, you converted your pomposity to give young people hope, you restored many even at the point of death. You did not consider your ministry as a competition with others. You are really a shadow of emulation, prophet of contentment, man of generosity, prophet of humility, prophet of the poor, one among the givers of our time\u201d.\n\nThe priest distributed over 4,000 bags of rice, condiments and clothes to less privileged members of the adoration family as part of his 2018 Christmas and New Year gifts.\n\nHaruna Ayuba who led a group of Northern Christians to the programme said: \u201cAll these good works and miracles of God through Fr Mbaka still confirm that in spite of all the attacks on him, the hand of God is still upon him and his ministry.\u201d\n\nHis many controversies\n\nMbaka is synonymous with controversies. From his frosty relationship with the then Governor of Enugu State, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani to the standoff with former President Goodluck Jonathan and then to the recent prophecy on the Imo State Governorship position, Mbaka\u2019s penchant for toeing paths other preachers would love to avoid could be clearly seen.\n\nNnamani was the first to taste the bitter pill from Mbaka. It was a tough eight years for the governor, as he found in Mbaka a man he could not handle. It was literally a battle of superiority between the two. Their friction got to its peak with the death of 14 worshippers following a stampede at the Adoration Ground; an incident Mbaka blamed on the then Governor. But Nnamani denied complicity in the incident and has continued to plead innocence till date.\n\nMbaka allegedly went ahead to prophesy that Nnamani would not win re-election in 2003. However, the governor won convincingly at the polls. He also contested and won a senatorial position in 2007 after serving his second term as governor.\n\nHis statements unarguably contributed to the failure of Chief Ikedi Ohakim to win re-election as governor of Imo State in 2011. The priest has since made up with the former governor.\n\nOn December 31, 2014, Mbaka shocked Nigerians, especially the entire South-East region as he prophesied against the re-election bid of the then President, Jonathan, whom he dubbed bad luck. In his New Year message for 2015, titled \u201cFrom good luck to bad luck,\u201d the priest tore the former president to shreds as he detailed his failure in tackling corruption and insecurity in the country.\n\nHe prophesied that the then opposition candidate, Buhari, would win at the polls. During the sermon at the Christ the King Catholic Parish, GRA, Enugu, Sunday, January 4, 2015, Mbaka said that he had been receiving threats.\n\n\u201cSurely, they shall gather, but because the gathering is not of God they shall scatter. No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper. They said Buhari gave me money, but I have never met with Buhari. I don\u2019t know him in person. I only delivered the message I was given and I stand by that message because the future of this country is bleak with Jonathan on the saddle,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the controversy raged; even many of Mbaka\u2019s staunch followers found it hard to accept it, with a lot of them suggesting that the priest had really dabbled into politics.\n\nOne of the celebrated attacks Mbaka received was a musical video by a local artiste known as BBC, titled: \u201cMbaka Why?\u201d The video further poured fuel into an already burning furnace. BBC went ahead to list a number of failed prophesies allegedly delivered by Mbaka and predicted that his prophecy against the president would fail likewise.\n\nMbaka\u2019s prophecy came to fruition as Jonathan was roundly defeated at the polls and the priest was vindicated.\n\nAnother controversial prophecy was the Imo State Governorship position which was at the time at the Supreme Court. The candidate of the PDP, Chief Emeka Ihedioha had won the election and was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) but Mbaka prophesied, even though Iheadioha had been sworn in as governor, that the candidate of the APC, Senator Hope Uzodimma would become governor of the state.\n\nMbaka advised those who might find the message unpalatable not to come after him, warning that such action would attract the wrath of the Holy Spirit upon such individuals.\n\n\u201cMany things are going to happen in Nigeria this 2020 that will shock countrymen and countrywomen; but all would be to God\u2019s glory. In spite of all that would happen this 2020, there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn Imo State, there is hope. Hope, hope, hope in Imo State! Imo people have suffered but God is raising a new hope that would be an agent of salvation for them. He\u2019s coming with a new flag to restore the dignity of that noble land.\n\n\u201cA new leadership that will break barriers and there would be joy in the land of Imo. Lift your candles as I bless Hope Uzodimma; and I empower him to, spiritually, to take over. How, I do not know.\n\n\u201cPlease, if you heard that there would be a new government in Imo and you don\u2019t like the message; if I say Hope, you can say hopeless but do not fight me.\n\n\u201cI am saying this in respect of those who may want to come after me because of the message. If you do that, the God of Moses, Elijah and Elisha will deal with you. I am only a messenger of God\u201d, he said.\n\nMany Nigerians, including priests, attacked Mbaka for making a prophecy that was at the time seen as impossible as they believed that Uzodimma did not even stand a chance even if Ihedioha should lose at the apex court.\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Imo State, and other religious leaders berated Mbaka over the prophecy insisting that it was politically motivated.\n\nAlso, the Imo State Chapter of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) in a statement in Owerri by its Chairman, Isidore Chukwuemeka, asked: \u201cWhere was Mbaka when Imo State was serially raped for eight years by a clueless administration that mindlessly looted the treasury of the state?\u201d\n\nEven after the prophecy was fulfilled, some people still continued their attack on Mbaka. Senior Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, Adewale Giwa said that he was not surprised to see the fulfilment of the prediction by Rev. Fr. Mbaka that Uzodimma would be declared Imo State Governor by the court as Mbaka was a partisan prophet, adding that he must have got the hint of the judgement before speaking.\n\nGiwa said: \u201cWhen a partisan prophet speaks, we surely know who gives him the hint. This is a concluded deal among them.\n\n\u201cIs it not the same prophet who enters Aso Rock, wining and dining with the President? We know where they all belong. Check my record, I stand by the truth at all times and the truth will eventually prevail in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMbaka later admitted that the prophecy was a risky one but cautioned people against attacking him or his prophesies. In a statement released weeks after Uzodimma was declared the substantive governor of Imo State.\n\n\u201cHelp me to correct the mendacious, heinous and horrendous impression given by the press over my relationship with my bishop. I have no problem with my bishop. Am I forgiving him for what? I didn\u2019t say that I have forgiven my bishop as they reported.\n\n\u201cI rather opined that I have forgiven all those who maligned me when I prophesied, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that Hope Uzodimma is going to be the governor of Imo state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary and secondary school, I had started seeing vision and doing mysterious things by God. Attacking me is a waste of time. That will not stop God in sending messages to me. So, you attackers, use your time and do meaningful something for yourself,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the wake of the crisis generated by Mbaka\u2019s prophecy, Bishop Callistus Onaga had instructed the Catholic faithful to disregard the prophecy.\n\nBut Mbaka had wondered why there was so much negative reaction to his Imo prophecy than when he prophesied late General Sani Abacha\u2019s death, late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death, as well as Buhari\u2019s take over from former President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cAll these came to pass, why is this one so catastrophic? Those who attacked me, who is now a loser? Is it you or me? Holy Spirit told me that Hope Uzodimma was going to become the governor of Imo State and I should obey God rather.\n\nHe cautioned the church and all those who were perturbed by his God\u2019s gift that they should know his gift did not just come when he became a priest.\n\nThe Catholic priest had on January 15, held the first thanksgiving for Uzodimma at the Adoration Ground, a day after the apex court sacked Ihedioha as governor.\n\nHis other controversies\n\nMbaka had described former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as Bureau de Change because of the mindboggling foreign currencies that reportedly exchanged hands at the last National Convention of the PDP in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, before he emerged the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2019 elections.\n\nRegardless, he warned him not to emulate Buhari if he was elected the president.\n\nMbaka stated that the President had all the human and materials resources at his disposal to make the country better but rather chose to play ethnic, despotic politics by surrounding himself with people without vision and not inclined to his line of thought. He noted that Buhari had wasted a golden opportunity offered him by God and by implication disobeyed God.\n\nHe also described the cost of the APC\u2019s expression of interest and nomination forms as outrageous; saying that if the leadership of the party had conscience, they would not have collected N24 million from people to obtain the forms. He added that a party with conscience would have returned the money to the aspirants instead of casting aspersions on them.\n\nAlthough Mbaka had predicted defeat for the ruling party in the elections but he said that there was still opportunity for change. He further warned Buhari that the \u201cprice of disobedience is disgrace.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if Atiku had the opportunity that the president has, he would have revamped Nigeria.\n\nEventually, when Buhari won the election, Mbaka said that Atiku had lost it in the spiritual realm the day he (Mbaka) apologised to his running mate, Obi.\n\nHe was to later celebrate President Buhari\u2019s victory in the Presidential polls on March 27; where he said that God had honoured his prophecy.\n\nMbaka said had the President lost in the polls, his ministry would have been closed down. \u201cBut our God is a humongous miracle. He has answered our prayers. I am happy. I am filled with joy. On this altar, we will decree and it will come to pass. Anybody I support will be victorious.\u201d\n\nHe declared that even if the Presidential polls were cancelled, Atiku and Obi would still lose a rerun because \u201cthe ways of God are not the ways of man. People should stop playing God\u201d.\n\nPrior to this period, the Human Rights Writers Association (HURIWA) had in January 2016, threatened to drag Mbaka to the Vatican following his prophecy on plots to kill Buhari. Leader of the group, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko had asked the Nigerian Catholic hierarchy to sanction the priest for abandoning his sacred vocation and deviating into the profane and mundane roadside career of high wire politics under the canopy of his Catholic\u2019s priestly vocation.\n\nVoice of the voiceless\n\nMbaka\u2019s closeness to Governor Ugwuanyi did not stop him from speaking out for the people as he openly decried the recent demolition of structures in Enugu by the Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority in its bid to restore the original master plan of the capital city.\n\nThe outspoken priest had described the action of the Enugu State Government as an atrocity against the people.\n\nAccording to him, the immensity of suffering and economic hardships in the country did not warrant the demolition of people\u2019s shops without giving them time, or providing alternative areas for them.\n\n\u201cIf you want to restore the master plan of 1933 in Enugu State, you should do it holistically. There are some areas where the master plan was flouted but because they belonged to the echelon political class, government is afraid of pulling the structures there down.\n\n\u201cWhat about Zoo Estate? The place that was made for animals\u2019 residence is now being harboured by human beings, so, you don\u2019t take justice one-sided; whoever errs must be punished. When I see you people destroying those ones, I now know that you are out to restore the original master plan of Enugu,\u201d Mbaka stated.\n\nMeanwhile mixed reactions have trailed the whole episode of his disappearance and reappearance. Former Federal Commissioner of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Executive Director of Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), blamed the diocesan bishop for allowing him the latitude of growing wings within the church.\n\nHe urged the Bishop of Enugu diocese to go ahead and close down the Adoration Ground, saying Mbaka should be defrocked and laicized if he became rebellious.\n\nOnwubiko said: \u201cI think the Bishop made a mistake to have allowed Rev Fr Mbaka to grow almost much bigger than his diocese by running his own ministry to the detriment of the core responsibilities for which he was ordained.\n\nIPOB seeks support for Mbaka\n\nMeanwhile, the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, in an audio broadcast has warned people from the South-East not to condemn the cleric.\n\nKanu reiterated that there are Nigerians like the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai who have grievous cases hanging on them, and appear to be sacred cows in Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cIn a normal country so to speak, the condemnation of Father Mbaka, you may welcome it somehow. I know sometimes regardless of our shortcomings, we are brutal in the way we think. We see what is bad and say it\u2019s bad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is doing it. That\u2019s why a lot of people came down heavily on Father Mbaka but I\u2019m telling you this, yes in Biafra, we can do anything we like to him. But, in Nigeria, as far as Nigeria is concerned, never ever condemn your own,\u201d Kanu said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld deregistration of 74 political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their inability to win any election after the 2019 general polls.\n\nJustice Adamu Jauro, who delivered the judgment of the apex court in a virtual court session on Friday, held that the deregistration of the affected political parties, including National Unity Party (NUP) was in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act. The judgment has to a large extent, sealed the fate of the remaining 73 parties many of whom have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. The Commission, which had on February 6, 2020, announced deregistration of the 74 political parties, hinged it on their failure to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitutional Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has determined that eighteen (18) political parties have fulfilled the requirements for an existence based on Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as follows,\u201d the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said. The Abuja division of the Federal High Court had in it\u2019s judgment, affirmed the power of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deregister political parties, which failed to comply with the provisions of the law particularly Section 225 A of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Justice Jauro, in his judgment delivered in the suit filed by the National Unity Party, one of the 74 parties deregistered by the INEC in February, affirmed that the constitutional power of the electoral commission and the reasons given by the Commission for deregistration of parties are valid, in conformity with the law, sacrosanct and could not be affected by the fact of anticipated Local government elections by some states, which dates were not fixed, certain or even ascertainable. The court, therefore, held that deregistration of National Unity Party as a political party in Nigeria was lawfully done in exercise of vested constitutional powers of the INEC in accordance with Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution. The judgment conclusively terminated the legal existence of the party and also all its other rights and obligations. With the ruling, all pending appeals by other deregistered parties are now an academic exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the judgment, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, hailed the judgment and said the judgment had ended all speculations and this will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.",

          "title": "How we spent $1bn to acquire weapons \u2013 Defence",
          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nThe Defence Ministry on Friday further gave an insight into how the controversial $1 billion released by President Muhammadu Buhari to procure arms was expended on the purpose for which it was released while waiting for the products\u2019 arrival about three years after.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Musa Istifanus, who stated this as a guest of honour at the Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) 2021 Summit in Kaduna, added that the procurement was made to address the security threats currently bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, those that were raising dust about the funds were doing so out of ignorance of how the funds were used for the purpose it was raised. He maintained that, \u201cthe Nigerian Government had spent N1 billion dollars in acquiring weapons for the war against the insurgency it is facing.\n\n\u201cSome ignorant people say that they have not seen any weapon. I know where the weapons are. They are yet to come. We paid $496millon to the American government and it is getting to three years now, the Super Tucanos are yet to arrive.

          "title": "For Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi and Hadiza Bala-Usman, It\u2019s Personal",
          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe suspension of Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority last Thursday by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, against civil service rules for the removal of heads of MDAs, was the culmination of the personal desire of the minister to remove Hadiza and truncate her second term as Managing Director of agency.\n\nHadiza was not told what her offences were or formally communicated, before her suspension was announced by the presidency.\n\nNot querying her or making her aware of her offence(s) before suspending her is a clear breach of the processes stipulated in the government\u2019s own regulation for disciplining heads of government agencies. A government circular dated May 19, 2020, and endorsed by the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, stipulated that when there is an issue of impropriety against the head of an agency, the federal government requires a minister, through the permanent secretary of the supervising ministry, to refer the matter to the governing board of the affected agency in line with its enabling law and chapters three and 16 of the Public Service Rules on discipline in government parastatals.\n\nThe board will then issue the affected official a query and subsequently advise the minister of its findings and recommendations. But if the board itself is the source of the allegation of misconduct against the chief executive or the chief executive is the chairman of the board, the minister, on the advice of the permanent secretary, still has to ensure a query is issued, requesting an explanation from the accused official.\n\nIn this case, neither the governing board nor the SGF was carried along before action was taking against Hadiza.\n\nIn the beginning, it was all well between Amaechi and Hadiza, who closely worked together when the minister was DG of the Buhari campaign and Hadiza was a close confidant of candidate Buhari, resulting in Amaechi recommending her as MD of NPA. When Amaechi became transport minister, things began to degenerate when he found Hadiza too independent to rein her in or control and the suspended MD would not serve in his court full of political courtiers.\n\nThings came to a head when Amaechi wanted to renew all dredging contractors of NPA. Many of the contractors had served for decades and Amaechi got Hadiza to cancel her public advertisement for bid but was later overruled by the BPE, acting on the orders of the president that a public bid be held.\n\nThe crisis deepened from one contract to the other as Hadiza insisted on due process and more often had presidential backing to the anger of Amaechi, who then promised that Hadiza would be a one term MD. To the minister\u2019s shock and consternation, Hadiza got a second term without his input and since then vowed to oust her.\n\nThe first attempt was when Amaechi accused Hadiza and the NPA of not auditing their books and recommended KPMG Nigeria; Deloitte Nigeria; Price Water House Coopers, Ernst and Young and Mckinsey and Company Nigeria. The Auditor-General of the Federation informed Amaechi that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe Auditor General of the Federation also told the minister that the NPA was in compliance with yearly audit unlike other government agencies.\n\nFrom that, the crisis culminated into the issue over remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds between 2016 and 2020 to Consolidated Revenue Funds (CRF) and the CBN.\n\nBefore Hadiza could respond to the query to show that NPA had indeed been remitting to the CRF and the CBN, Amaechi got the President to approve her ouster without due process on the pretext that a panel had been set up to probe her management of then agency. Ironically, the person to act for her while on suspension is the Executive Director, Finance of NPA, Mohammed Koko, who was not suspended, despite the planned probe of NPA\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Minister alleged that the NPA under Hadiza could not account for N165.320 billion between 2018 and 2020 in the record of its remittance of operations surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds. Amaechi in a letter addressed to the office of the President on March this year, alleged that NPA\u2019s yearly remittance of operating surpluses from year 2016-2020 fell short of the actual amount due for actual remittance.\n\nAmaechi wrote: \u201cIn view of the above, I wish to suggest that the financial account of the activities of Nigerian Ports Authority be investigated for the period 2016-2020 to ascertain the true financial position and the outstanding unremitted balance of One hundred and sixty-five billion, three hundred and twenty million, nine hundred and sixty-two thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven naira only (N165,320,962,697).\u201d\n\nThe minister therefore sought that \u201cthe account and remittance of NPA in the period of 2018-2020 be audited to account for the gross shortfall of remitted public funds.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency, in a letter dated March 30, and which was signed by the Chief of Staff to the President granted the prayers of the Transport Minister on the need to audit the books of NPA\n\nHowever, there was a drama as the office of the Auditor General of the Federation clarified that the NPA Act did not give anyone the responsibility of authorising the Auditor General of the Federation to audit its accounts. It however explained that it is within the purview of the office of the Auditor General of the Federation to provide NPA with a list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors, among others.\n\nIn the memo signed by the Auditor-General of the Federation, the Transport Minister was informed that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe memo also said that both firms had audited and published the audited accounts of NPA as approved by the board for 2016, 2017 and 2018, adding that the audit of 2019 was ongoing, awaiting NPA\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the position of the AGF, Amaechi, through a memo issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Magdalene Ajani and addressed to the Auditor-General of the Federation, called for a holistic audit of all financial activities of the NPA and went further to list some selected audit firms for the job.\n\nThose familiar with the crisis said it has been a cat and mouse relationship between the Minister and the embattled chief executive of NPA, for over five years climaxing in the rejection of the record of NPA\u2019s remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the CRF.\n\nThe cat and mouse relationship between Amaechi and Hadiza was also fuelled by the suspicion that the executive director was too close to the supervising minister, a development that was said to have raised the fear that the director had been leaking some sensitive information especially of the finances of NPA to the Minister.\n\nKoko is known to be close to Amaechi in his days as governor of Rivers State. Koko was then a staff of Zenith Bank in Port Harcourt.\n\nThere was also the battle over the sack of Intels, a major contractor of NPA by Bala-Usman. The firm was a major sponsor of APC in the 2015 election and the transport minister was looking towards the firm for support in 2023. Amaechi wanted Intels badly but Hadiza denied him.\n\nPolitical Tweets\n\nBala-Usman finally played into the hands of those plotting her ouster with her recent political tweet on the state of the nation.\n\nReacting to the rising insecurity in the country, Hadiza on February 27, tweeted, \u201cThe state of insecurity in the country that has led to the kidnap of Kagara boys and Zamfara girls need to be addressed urgently\u2026We can\u2019t go on like this! Rescue our children and secure our country that\u2019s all we ask\u2026#SecureNorth #SecureNigeria.\u201d\n\nThe tweets caught the attention of her opponents who intensified moves to remove her for daring to take on a government which she served.\n\nPresident Buhari and her other sympathisers in the Presidency could no longer help her case when attention were called to the tweet which presented her as a sharp critic of the administration, who could no longer be trusted because of the suspicion that she might be working for the opposition.\n\nBala-Usman\u2019s last-Minute Efforts\n\nHowever, Bala-Usman, who got wind of the plot against her, had on Wednesday fired a memo addressed to the Chief of Staff to the President, stating her position and calling for involvement of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation to establish the true position of the authorities\u2019 remittances.\n\nIn the memo she personally signed, Bala-Usman explained that the Authority\u2019s computation of its remittances to the CFR are concluded arising from numbers from the audited financial statements using the template forwarded to the authority from the Fiscal Responsibility Commission and not budgetary provision.\n\nShe insisted that the NPA has remitted the full amount due it to CFR for the periods 2017 and 2018 arising from the operating surplus derived from the audited financial statement for the period totalling N76.384 billion as evidenced in treasury receipts.\n\nAccording to her, NPA had remitted a total of N82.687billion for the period 2019 and 2020 pending the audit of the financial statement at which point the amount so much computed arising from the value of the operating surplus to the audited financial statement will be remitted to the CFR.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that the Chief of Staff requests the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation who are the statutorily custodian of status of payment to the CRF to provide clartrue position of the Authorities remittances to the CFR,\u201d she submitted.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, pundits are wondering if President Buhari will discard his adopted daughter for an unreliable former governor of Rivers State who ditched his predecessor Peter Odili and not on speaking terms with his successor, Nyesom Wike.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says sack of 74 parties complied with extant provisions of Constitution, Electoral Act\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria yesterday put a final lid on the prospect of reinstating the 74 political parties deregistered by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for failure to win any elective position in the 2019 general election, when it ruled that the deregistration of one of the affected parties, National Unity Party (NUP), is constitutional.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous judgment delivered virtually by Justice Chima Nweze upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal which had earlier affirmed the deregistration of the NUP.\n\nBy this action, the apex court has sealed the fate of the remaining 73 deregistered parties, many of which have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.\n\nThe NUP had challenged its deregistration by INEC in line with the laws and in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act.\n\nIt noted that INEC \u201chas the legal power\u201d to deregister the affected political party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, by affirming the concurrent findings of the lower courts on the NUP case, has upheld not only the powers of INEC to deregister political parties, but also that the process and procedure adopted for the deregistration of the 74 political parties was in compliance with extant laws.\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement yesterday, INEC was faced with multiple cases by the deregistered political parties, with the courts giving conflicting judgements.\n\nIn one of such cases by some of the 74 deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja, had in a judgment delivered on July 29, 2020, affirmed the powers of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nThe appellate court in a unanimous decision presented by Justice Mohammed Idris, held that INEC acted within the constitutional provisions, as well as the Electoral Act in sacking the political parties, which failed to win a single office in the last general election.\n\nConsequently, the Court of Appeal nullified and set aside the judgment of Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier nullified INEC\u2019s deregistration of the political parties on the grounds that the deregistration breached Section 225(a) of the Constitution. The affected parties headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe said constitutional provision -Section 225(a) \u2013 spells out the minimum election victory a party must record or percentage of votes it must poll to sustain its status as a registered political party.\n\nIn another case by some other deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, ordered the commission to re-list 22 of the political parties deregistered for failing to win any elective office in the 2019 general election.\n\nThe court made the order shortly after setting aside a judgment of the Federal High Court, which upheld the power of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nJustice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, in a judgment delivered on June 11, 2020 had dismissed the suit of the 22 appellants challenging the power of INEC to deregister them.\n\nReacting to yesterday\u2019s ruling, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council, Dr. Leonard Nzenwa hailed the judgment, saying it had ended all speculations and that \u201cthis will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomole, has described the call for military takeover of a democratically elected government as irresponsible and senseless.\n\nOshiomhole\u2019s reaction followed a recent call by legal luminary, Chief Roberts Clarke, in an interview on television, for military intervention in governance in order to fix the country\u2019s festering security challenges and to carry out restructuring of the country.\n\nThe former national Chairman of APC spoke yesterday in Abuja when the leadership of the Law Students Association of Nigeria (LAWSON), paid him a courtesy visit, during which they invited him to their forthcoming National Conference on Rule of Law.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI watched on a national television one of your very senior colleagues, Chief Robert Clarke, I was shocked when I saw him calling on the President to handover to the military.\n\n\u201cI thought that was the height of irresponsibility, given his knowledge, given his age and a very senior member of the bar and, what is it that he wanted? He wants a military that will restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is again for me senseless, because the structure as it is today, who put it in place? Who overthrew the parliamentary system?\u201d\n\nThe former Edo State Governor was of the opinion that the first thing that suffers under the military is the rule of law, adding that for anyone who is familiar with the military system, like Clarke, should tender apology to Nigerians.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe parliamentary system was overthrown by the Nigerian military. That is on record. Who created 12 states from the four regions by decree? It was the military. The current 36 states and FCT; who created them by military decree? It was the military. How can anybody who has lived through and who is familiar with our journey as a nation think that the solution to our problems as a nation is to handover to the military? I think, talking about the rule of law, that is treason.\n\n\u201cYou know we have freedom of speech but it does not include the freedom to canvass unlawful means to effect a change. When you canvas unlawful means, then you should be arraigned before a court of law and dealt with according to the law. Ignorance is not even an excuse in law, not to talk of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOshiomhole called on Nigerians to have faith in the country in spite of the challenges, while urging everyone not to give up.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that even in our moment of distress and regardless of what anybody thinks, the world has resolved and Nigeria is part of it, that never again shall we be governed by an unelected government, never, we don\u2019t want unelected Angels.\u201d\n\nOn the agitation for separation, the APC chieftain described those agitating for secession as \u201cpoor students of history\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am also not agreeing with those who think of dis-membering Nigeria. They say let everybody go his way. Nigeria is not a reality. Those ones are poor students of history.\n\n\u201cWhy is Europe spending so much time forming the European Union to create a larger market? Recently, we signed the African Trade Agreement so that Nigeria can access a bigger market. We already have a local market of 200 million. If we can keep it flourishing and increase the purchasing power of the citizens, we already have a huge market. That should be an asset.

          "text": "\u2022Raised red flags snubbed by US bank\u2019s management\n\nFestus Akanbi and Emmanuel Addeh, with agency report\n\nFresh documents on the long-standing legal dispute between the federal government and Malabu Oil have shown that JP Morgan, the American bank in the middle of the alleged scandal, was alerted by its internal control team that the $875 million transfers to former petroleum minister Dan Etete, for the sale of OPL 245, were questionable.\n\nEtete, who was minister under the Sani Abacha regime, has been in the eye of the storm concerning the sale of the oil block which triggered a number of court cases in Nigeria and in Europe.\n\nA report yesterday by Bloomberg indicated that JPMorgan Chase & Co. was warned by its compliance team over the \u201cgreat risk\u201d of corruption just days before it made the last of three transfers that totalled $875 million to Etete.\n\nThe federal government, in a London lawsuit, is pushing that the internal memo sent by the compliance unit to the bank\u2019s managers should be scrutinised.\n\nThe U.S. bank is accused of ignoring the red flags when it transferred funds between 2011 and 2013 to Dan Etete, whose private jet was seized by the Buhari government.\n\nThe memo disclosed at a London court hearing last Wednesday showed what JPMorgan managers knew about the oil contract and when, lawyers for the Nigerian government said in court documents. A spokesperson for the investment bank declined to comment.\n\nAccording to court documents, by 2013, JPMorgan\u2019s internal concerns over payments to Malabu Oil and Gas were escalated to more senior members of the bank.\n\n\u201cIn light of Malabu\u2019s reported connection to the alleged Nigerian corruption scheme, there would be great risk presented if JPMC continues to process wires involving Malabu,\u201d a compliance officer based in the United States wrote in a memo dated Aug. 23, 2013 and quoted by Bloomberg.\n\nJust six days later, JPMorgan made a payment of $75.2 million to the Malabu account, according to the report.\n\nLawyers for the federal government said in court last Wednesday that they wanted to know how the memo was compiled and asked a judge for more emails and documents from the compliance team.\n\nThe lawyers are seeking details of how the US bank\u2019s compliance team monitored and placed controls over questionable payments including a so-called \u201cinterdiction list\u201d, a tool to prevent transfers from being automatically cleared. Malabu was placed on the list in November 2013.\n\nThe federal government had alleged that most of the $1.3 billion purchase price for the licence for the offshore oilfield known as OPL 245 was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen under previous administrations.\n\nIn 1998, the government awarded OPL 245 for $20 million to Malabu Oil and Gas, which was later found to be owned by Dan Etete, who was oil minister at the time, in collaboration with people close to former military ruler, Sani Abacha.\n\nThree years later, in July 2001, the then government under President Olusegun Obasanjo revoked OPL 245 licence, triggering legal disputes over its ownership that dragged on for years.\n\nBy 2006, Malabu reached a settlement with the federal government, agreeing to pay $218 million to Nigeria in return for the licence being fully reinstated, after it was given to Shell, which subsequently failed to pay.\n\nThe case became even more complex when Mohammed Abacha, son of the former ruler, launched a legal challenge arguing that Etete pushed him out of his partial ownership of Malabu.\n\nIn 2011, Malabu agreed to hand OPL 245 back to the government for $1.092 billion. In parallel, Shell and Eni agreed to pay the government $1.092 billion plus a signature bonus of $208 million, taking their payment for OPL 245 to $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the same year, $1.092 billion was placed in an escrow account opened by the Nigerian government with U.S. bank JP Morgan, from which $875 million was transferred to bank accounts in the name of Malabu.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria filed a case at a London High Court against the bank alleging negligence for its role in transferring the $875 million to Etete\u2019s Malabu, an allegation JP Morgan said it considered \u201cunsubstantiated and without merit\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, a Nigerian judge issued arrest warrants for Dan Etete, and an Eni manager over the sale of the oilfield.\n\nEuropean and Nigerian courts have been raking over the purchase by Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc of the oil license in Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, a decade ago.\n\nWhile the energy giants were recently acquitted of corruption charges in Milan, in a decision prosecutors could appeal, Nigeria\u2019s government is continuing to seek compensation from JPMorgan.\n\nThe Buhari administration claims Etete distributed a portion of the funds received via the bank from the oil majors to corrupt former and serving senior public officials.\n\nThe bank has denied any wrongdoing and says it is being held responsible for not protecting the Nigerian people from their own government.\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s oil minister in the last weeks of the corrupt Abacha military regime in 1998, Etete was said to have effectively awarded the prospecting rights of the huge OPL 245 block to the company he secretly controlled.\n\nAfter Abacha\u2019s sudden death, Etete retained the rights as a private citizen until he offloaded them to oil giants Shell and Eni in 2011, and they paid a combined $1.3 billion to the federal government.\n\nThe entire OPL245 deal was a subject of a corruption trial in Italy, where Etete was an accused, together with alleged middlemen, Eni and Shell, and several of their executives. The court recently acquitted the international oil executives.\n\nThe Nigerian authorities had also charged Etete and several others linked to Malabu with money laundering in connection with the onward flow of funds from the OPL245 deal.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the allegations as \u201cpolitical propaganda.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

(Lamentations 3:38).\n\n\u201cFinally, in all things, let\u2019s learn to say thank you, father, and It is well. God bless all of you in Jesus\u2019 name,\u201d Adeboye said.\n\nThe RCCG overseer further stated that peace is one of the blessings only God can give, saying, \u201cThere is a peace that passes human understanding. It is only God that can give that peace. I thank God that I have that peace.\u201d\n\nAdeboye also allayed fears over the possibility of a third wave of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Nigeria, saying it was due to the prayers of Christians that COVID-19 did not take a detrimental dimension.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to any person who says it is by their wisdom that coronavirus is now subdued in Nigeria. It is because you prayed. You asked God for mercy, and God heard and in the mighty name of Jesus, there will be no third wave.\n\n\u201cBut, I want to encourage you that you need to pray again. We have problems of many kinds in Nigeria, so very soon, you might be summoned to pray again. We need to pray against all the problems we are facing, and God will answer when we pray,\u201d Adeboye said.",

They shouldn\u2019t mistake our restraint for the humanitarian goals of protecting innocent lives as a weakness or a sign of fear or irresolution,\u201d the president said.\n\nMARCH 30: BUHARI ORDERS SERVICE CHIEFS TO TAKE OUT BANDITS, THEIR SPONSORS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Buhari, as quoted by Babagana Monguno, the national security adviser (NSA), called for a proactive approach in dealing with bandits.\n\nThe president directed service chiefs to take out bandits and their sponsors to boost the confidence of the people.\n\n\u201cMr president has made it very clear to both the intelligence and operational elements that the first assignment will be to identify the leaders of these bandits, kidnappers and take them out, in order to restore confidence in those areas,\u201d Monguno said.\n\n\u201cMr president has said that he will no longer tolerate a situation whereby bandits and kidnappers are the ones dictating the pace and setting the tone and he will not also condone a situation in which our own operations are reactionary rather than being proactive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPRIL 23: BUHARI SAYS FG HAS CAPACITY TO CRUSH BANDITS\n\nOn April 22, TheCable reported that more than 25 people were killed in attacks on Gobirawa, Rini, Gora, and Madoti Dankule in Bakura and Maradun LGAs in Zamfara state.\n\nReacting to the incident, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, quoted Buhari as saying that his administration has the capacity to crush bandits.\n\nBuhari said the Nigerian military possess \u201cmassive firepower\u201d to take down bandits and burn down their camps.\n\n\u201cThese criminals should stop pushing their luck too far by believing that the government lacks the capacity to crush them,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not give these criminals any opportunity to succeed by taking the war to their own camps and stop them in their tracks before they even have the time to respond under our massive firepower.\u201d\n\nMAY 5: BUHARI SHIFTS FROM THREATS TO APPEAL\n\nFollowing the release of 27 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, the president appealed to bandits to ensure the release of other kidnapped students.\n\nThe students gained their freedom on Thursday, over one month after they were abducted.\n\nThe presidential spokesman, in a statement, said: \u201cThe President appeals for the release of the students of the Greenfield University and all other citizens held in captivity, expressing the strong determination of his administration to ensure that Nigerians lived in a country where everyone can move where they want, when they want without the fear of kidnapping and banditry.\u201d\n\nWhat necessitated the softened tone and \u201cappeal\u201d to criminals is a question that has left many Nigerians scratching their heads.",

          "text": "BY ADELA BELIN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVirtual events have been an ongoing part of the online learning culture for a long time.\n\nAccording to a study by Hubspot,62% of marketers leveraged virtual events in 2021, out of which 91% said they were a success and turned out to be their number 1 video marketing channel.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a digital age where a simple presentation with a moderator and speaker won\u2019t work to keep the audience engaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many event hosting platforms, motivating audiences, and a high benchmark for quality- hosting a virtual event comes with many challenges.\n\nThis article will discuss some best practices to host a successful virtual event in 2021 that everyone will remember.\n\nPlan your event well in advance\n\nTo bridge the gap between an in-person and virtual event and make the event successful, planning is essential. You cannot expect to host a good event if you don\u2019t know which direction to go. So, sit down with your team and plan your event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some questions to consider while planning:\n\nHow many sessions do you want to conduct?\n\nHow long will the event be?\n\nWhere will it be hosted?\n\nWhat is the technology you need to succeed?\n\nHow will the team function effectively?\n\nAll of this planning needs to be done before you can even think about taking the next few steps towards hosting the event. This will get you sorted in the head and give you a direction to proceed forward.\n\nBe clear on your event agenda\n\nIf you don\u2019t know \u2018why\u2019 you want to conduct the event or what message you want to convey, it will be challenging to ensure your speakers and audience are on the same page.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to host a virtual event for freelancers to talk about the gig economy and become a highly profitable freelancer. In that case, you need to ensure everything aligns with this agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour marketing messaging, channels, speakers, sessions-everything needs to be on the same page for the event to leave a mark behind and be successful in its goal.\n\nSo, figure out your agenda for the event. Write down some guidelines for using that in your messaging while bringing speakers onboard and communicating the message to the audience.\n\nThis message needs to stand out if you want to boost your event attendance and ensure some key takeaways are attached to the event.\n\nOnboard the right speakers\n\nChoosing the right speakers for your event is extremely important and can be a make or break factor for its success. Before you proceed to reach out to prospect speakers, you should explore their content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee what kind of content they create and how they engage with their audience. This will tell you if they\u2019re exciting and will be able to hook your audience. Also, it\u2019ll let you know about their knowledge of the field and how much of an expert you\u2019re inviting.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve shortlisted your speakers and it\u2019s time to invite them, try to build a relationship. Comment on their blog, listen to their podcast, engage on their social media- so you have some material about them when you pitch the event.\n\nThe more personalized your pitch, the better your chances are of hearing a response. After they respond, it would be best to get on a call and discuss everything to ensure you\u2019re on the same page and the agenda is clear.\n\nCreate an engagement strategy for the event\n\nA virtual event is not just about a presentation and speaker; it should be as interactive as possible. If the attendees hear the speakers all day, it will be boring. There should be some activity for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis could be a question/answer session, networking, polls, quizzes, etc. These will keep the attendees engaged throughout the event, avoiding the chances of them bouncing off.\n\nCreate an engagement strategy for the event, which includes activities in every interval. Some can be during the sessions like polls, and others can be between breaks like networking. Keep a list of such activities ready so whenever you feel the audience is getting bored, or there\u2019s a delay, you can keep them engaged.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the essential factors of a successful event- so don\u2019t overlook its importance.\n\nHave an event marketing plan in place\n\nTo ensure you have a good amount of people attending the event, marketing is essential. You need to start creating a buzz about the event since the day you start planning it to keep people updated and stay on top of their heads.\n\nMake a pre, during, and post-marketing plan to keep the interest going on. Here\u2019s how you should plan it:\n\nPre-event phase\n\nThis phase should promote the agenda, get people to talk about it, activate social profiles, and send out a press release to intrigue people to follow the event. This will ultimately lead to buying tickets.\n\nDuring-event phase\n\nThis phase should focus on real-time updates of the event to keep everyone interested in what\u2019s going on inside. These highlights would be beneficial if you plan a second edition of the event too.\n\nPost-event phase\n\nThis should mainly include testimonials about the event, experiences, some behind-the-scenes actions, significant highlights, etc. It\u2019ll help you close the event on a good note and set the stage for the next edition.\n\nConclusion\n\nHosting a virtual event comes with its fair set of challenges, but if you prepare for them in advance- it can be a smooth ride. It\u2019s one of the best ways to build a community, get connected with people across the world virtually, and provide a lot of value.\n\nFocus on the planning phase and providing authentic, valuable content to the audience. Use these five tips to provide a high-quality event experience to your audience and make it successful.\n\nAdela Belin is a content marketer and blogger at Writers Per Hour.

          "title": "Uganda wants to replace its social media tax with a 12% tax on internet bundles",
          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

          "text": "Paystack, a fintech company that powers growth and payments for businesses in Africa, today announced its official launch in South Africa after a six-month pilot. The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, has launched a policy that may see Nigerian startups enjoy more government ICT contracts.\n\nOn Thursday, May 6, 2021, the Nigerian Federal Government officially launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector. It also launched the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.\n\nThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration reiterated the mandatory use of NIN for all sim registration\n\nThe National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector is in line with the eighth pillar in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) Document unveiled in November 2019 by the President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eighth pillar, titled \u201cIndigenous Content Development and Adoption\u201d, is to provide a policy framework to identify jobs that are currently being outsourced and support the repatriation of these jobs to digitally skilled Nigerians.\n\nOne of the implementation strategies of the pillar states that the government will increase the patronage of digital startups, enabling them to access a minimum percentage of government-funded jobs.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the Nigerian government is not known to give its ICT contracts to Nigerian startups. A notice on the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) website in 2017 called for interested bidders to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to build a secure e-ticketing system on an investment basis.\n\nOne of the eligibility criteria listed on the notice mandates companies to have \u201cverifiable evidence of financial capability with an average annual turnover of not less than \u20a61 billion ($2.8 million) in the last three years (2014, 2015, and 2016).\u201d A most unrealistic criterion likely to marginalise small Nigerian startups and ICT companies.\n\nA more recent example is the Lagos unified Internet Fibre Infrastructure Project begun in 2020. Local Industry experts revealed that details of the project were unclear regarding the future of fibre infrastructure in Lagos State.\n\nHowever, as we reported in 2020, the Ekiti State Government partnered with on-demand mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), to digitise operations of commercial motorcycles (Okada) and tricycles (Keke). The startup was to introduce digital technology to aid the project.\n\nWhile the new policy might pave the way for government patronage of Nigerian startups, it remains to be seen, given history, how well the policy would be implemented.

We have been in touch with the police headquarters and agreed that Edo State Government will intervene in upgrading and improving the training facility and make it available for training the policemen and other members of the security architecture in the State.\n\n\u201cWe are redesigning the security architecture for the state and it will enable us to have a permanent training facility for about five or six squads at a time, made up of fifty men in each squad.\n\n\u201cThey will be equipped with introductory training in security, intermediate and advanced training as well in different levels. It can\u2019t happen with the facility in a state of disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come in to do an evaluation and assessment ourselves. The clinic needs to be rehabilitated and re-equipped and the hostels need to be rebuilt and re-equipped for decent habitation. The classroom needs to be rebuilt and the training ground and the obstacles need to be upgraded and repaired,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor further noted that \u201cthe state government is concerned about the state of the security system and cannot leave it for the Federal Government alone. Security is everybody\u2019s concern and as a state government, we have decided to put our money where our mouth is and use what we have to try and solve our problem\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Police Commissioner said that \u201cas a Force, we are happy that this facility is going to be upgraded by the Edo State Government.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state. I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NigComSat) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will facilitate the release of contiguous bandwidth in one of the most suitable frequency spectrum bands for early deployment of fifth Generation (5G) Network services in Nigeria.\n\nThe MoU signing ceremony was the high point of discussions by the two organisations on how to relocate the NG-1R satellite of NigComSat to the standard C-band 300MHz (3.9GHz \u2013 4.2GHz) portion of the band, which is considered more suitable in terms of satellite service offering because of the advantage of cheaper terminal devices for end-users.\n\nAccordingly, such relocation will leave the non-standard C-band 400MHz (3.5GHz \u2013 3.9GHz) portion of the band for 5G use while the cost of relocating the NG-1R is expected to be offset from the proceeds of the auction of the 5G spectrum.\n\nSpeaking at the event at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja on Wednesday, May 5, 2021, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Umar Danbatta, appreciated the leadership of NigComSat \u201cfor demonstrating that the interest of our dear country is paramount to our organisational or personal interest\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the Commission initiated negotiations with NigComSat to make some adjustment to its satellite operation and release part of its spectrum holding in the band to facilitate the deployment of 5G in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAmong the Frequency Spectrum bands used for 5G, the C-band (3.4GHz \u2013 3.9GHz) stands out because its balancing point between coverage and capacity provides the perfect environment for 5G connectivity. The C-band is most suitable and appropriate for immediate deployment of 5G services taking into consideration availability of device ecosystem with 60-70 per cent of global commercial 5G network deployment currently in the band, thus the importance of this Spectrum for early deployment of 5G services in Nigeria cannot be over-emphasized,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor optimal 5G service performance, an average of contiguous 100 MHz of spectrum in the C-band is required by an Operator. However, in Nigeria, only 120 MHz of the band (3.4 \u2013 3.52) GHz is available for mobile services while the remaining 680 MHz (3.52 \u2013 4.2) GHz of the band is used by NigComSat (NG-1R) satellites.\u201d\n\nMr Danbatta, while stating that the MoU will go a long way in making positive impact on the Nigerian economy, also said it will offer a new chapter of cooperation, collaborations and mutual assistance that will further spur the growth of the telecommunications ecosystem in the country.\n\nIn her remarks, the Managing Director of NigComSat, Abimbola Alale, said her organisation was happy about the collaboration, which will ensure a win-win relationship between both agencies of government as well as benefit the government in its drive to facilitate the development of Nigeria\u2019s digital ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with this agreement; the Commission has assured us of a win-win engagement which signals a major step towards the development of the Federal Government\u2019s digital economy drive,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, Board of Commissioners, NCC, Adeolu Akande, who was represented by a Board member, Uche Onwude, commended the two agencies for taking a bold step in the right direction to release contagious quantum of spectrum in the 3.5GHz band for early deployment of 5G.\n\nAccording to Akande, \u201cthis type of collaboration is commendable as it ensures synergy amongst agencies under the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy and will consequently foster the deployment of 5G and enable Nigeria to tap its full potential like other advanced countries which have deployed 5G technology on a full commercial scale.\u201d\n\nThe epoch-making event was attended by Board members and senior management staff of the two organisations.",

When President Muhammad was contesting we thought the Nation\u2019s messiah was coming to liberate the country not knowing he would compound the problems already on ground.\u201d\n\nHe said the Nigerian leaders have failed in thier leadership responsibilities, this according to him had led to varieties of crises currently bedeviling the country.\n\nHe cited problem of insecurity, bad economy, unemployment among the youths, among others issues, urging the people of the country to go back to God and seek His intervention.\n\nThe renowned Islamic Scholar , however, commended Governor of Osun, Mr Gboyega Oyetola for his laudable achievements within the space of two years despite meager resources of the state .\n\nHe described the Governor as a silent achiever who he said had done tremendously well in the area of infrastructure, workers welfare among , provision of good health cares, good education policies among others.\n\nEchoing a similar view, Alhaji Adekilekun, who is the Chief Imam, Ansarudeen Muslim Society, Ede, said unconscionable acts of banditry, kidnapping and other forms of terrorism stem from poor governance.\n\n\u201cWe have enormous resources, human and natural. We have no business being where we are today as a nation. We have brilliant and patriotic Nigerians that can drive the process of the nation\u2019s renaissance, and they cut across the divide.\u201d\n\nAlhaji Adekilekun , however, urged parents on the need to take better responsibility of their children saying most of these issues are caused by bad youths who lack parental care while in their adolescent ages.\n\nSpeaking, the National Coordinator of Yoruba Progressive Forum, Alhaji Olalekan Lateef popularly known as Asiri Ede said that the maiden edition of annual Ramadan Lecture was organized in honour of the state Governor of Osun, Mr Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nLateef appreciated the guest lecturers and other invited guests who deemed it fit to attend the programme, Praying God to continue to provide for their needs.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government, says it plans to raise about $250 million from the private sector to float it proposed national carrier, which is now at the stage of procurement phase.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Ministry of Aviation in a publication titled, \u2018Status of the Road Map/PPP Projects.\u201d\n\nThe publication, which was obtained by THISDAY, stated that the next steps would involve the commencement of procurement phase by placing adverts for request for qualification in the national dailies and foreign media.\n\nThe government said the establishment of a national carrier would enable Nigeria gain optimal benefits from Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA), take full advantage of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) and introduce competition, leading to competitive fares and services as well as to generate employment.\n\n\u201cThe national carrier project will be private sector driven, with government holding not more than five per cent of the shares. The private sector consortium may comprise reputable international airlines, such as Qatar Airways, leasing companies, aircraft manufacturers (OEMS), financial and institutional investors,\u201d the publication stated.\n\nIt noted that government would provide the required support by creating enabling environment in terms of sustainable policies, allocation of BASA, routes provision, financial guarantees and ensuring fiscal incentives to sustain the success of the airline.\n\nGovernment explained that the project development phase has been completed with the development of the outline business case (OBC) and subsequent issuance of compliance certificate by the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), adding that the next step would be placement of request for qualification (RFQ) in local and international media.\n\nOn aircraft leasing company, the federal government said the leasing company would provide leasing opportunities for Nigerian and African airlines in order to boost fleet size; alleviate the problems of aircraft leasing and the attendant high insurance premium charges.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft leasing company has been structured as a joint venture between the government and the private sector and its business objectives will be to initially lease aircraft from international lessors and subsequently sub-lease to African airlines and in the future acquire and own its aircraft.\n\n\u201cGovernment is considering providing financial guarantee and ensuring fiscal incentives to facilitate the success of the leasing company,\u201d the Ministry said.\n\nGovernment also said it is at advanced stage in the procurement phase and that a preferred partner has been selected and negotiations would soon commence, adding that the next move would be to commence negotiations with the preferred bidder.\n\nOn airport concession, the federal government said the concession of the four major airports in Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt would help fast-track, upgrade and enhance their operational efficiency, profitability and reposition them to operate competitively.\n\n\u201cThe project is being structured as a terminal concession under Public, Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement between the government and the private sector, were the private investor will be required to upgrade, manage and operate the airport terminals over the concession period,\u201d the Ministry of Aviation said.\n\nOn the status of project development, government said the development phase has been completed with the development of the Outline Business Case (OBC) and subsequent issuance of compliance certificate by the ICRC.\n\nThe next step on airport concession would be placement of request for qualification for local and international media.\n\nThese three major projects were what the President Muhammadu Buhari said his administration would accomplish in the aviation sector.\n\nOthers include establishment of Aerospace University and designation of airports as free trade/economic processing zones.\n\nBut as the second tenure of the administration has gone half way through, these projects are still far from being completed.\n\nThe Managing Director, Flight and Logistics Solutions, Amos Akpan told THISDAY that there was not much time left for the Buhari\u2019s administration to realise the projects in the aviation sector.\n\nHe said if government has money it could realise some of the projects but currently government is broke so it cannot float an airline and that it takes time for the private sector to fund such project because they would look at many variables, including environmental needs, due diligence, risk assessment and environmental assessment.\n\nAkpan said investors would also compare investing in Nigeria and investing in other countries in the continent and make comparison, adding that it would not be easy at this time for the private sector to commit funds in any project in the country.\n\nAkpan said, \u201cThe government has more critical areas that contend for the funds available than to use it to float national airline within one year and six months. If they invite private investors, there are procedures those investors need to go through before decision to participate is taken.\n\n\u201cThey would carry out risk analysis on the proposed investment portfolio. They will carry out due diligence on the subject of investment. There is also the issue of comparative analysis on the environment, which is best environment amongst available options?\u201d\n\nThisDay",

However, at this time, moving this headquarters (AFRICOM HQ) to Africa is not part of any plans, but USAFRICOM\u2019s commitment to their mission, our African and other partners, remains as strong today as when we launched this command more than a decade ago,\u201d US Pentagon spokesperson, Ms Cindi King, said.\n\nKing also ruled out any plan to consider Buhari\u2019s request in an ongoing global US defence review, according to PUNCH.\n\nShe said, \u201cAlthough there is an ongoing Global Posture Review, the relocation of Combatant Command headquarters is outside the scope of its assessment. In the case of AFRICOM, previous studies have concluded that the cost associated with the relocation of this headquarters is significant and likely to incur the expense of other engagement opportunities and activities that more directly benefit our valued African partners.\n\n\u201cWe greatly value the partnership with Nigeria and appreciate President Buhari\u2019s recognition of the United States\u2019 positive contribution to African peace and security, as well as other regional partners that have made similar past pronouncements. The United States remains committed to continuing our close partnership with African countries and organisations to promote security and stability.\u201d",

          "text": "BY BODE GBADEBO\n\nThe All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) has initiated legal proceedings against the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, over his alleged stance to destabilise the body\u2019s internal democracy structure and impede farmers\u2019 efforts at working harmoniously with the federal government in attaining food security.\n\nRELATED: AFAN LEADERSHIP TUSLE: Court Adjourns Case Till May 4\n\nIn a release signed by the assistant publicity secretary of the umbrella body of farmers in the country, Salisu Mukhtar, AFAN noted that the undue interference of the minister, rooted in vendetta by insistently recognising an illegal faction of the group, was at cross-purposes with its constitution and counter-intuitive to the rule of law.\n\n\u201cUpon the appointment of Alhaji Mohammed Sabo Nanono as HMA, who was once removed as acting Chairman of AFAN Kano State chapter in 2007 for misappropriating fertilizer, the undue interference in AFAN activities began.\u201d\n\nAccording to the body, AFAN being an NGO is not a department in FMARD and cannot be controlled or destroyed by any individual no matter how highly placed.\n\n\u201cActions of the HMA which have become a mockery of the law include recognising an unconstitutional and illegitimate leadership faction of the association by playing host to them in his office on several occasions and accepting invitations by them in the full glare of the public, in spite of knowledge of the pending court case.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis polarising act by a minister representing a constitutionally recognised administration of President Buhari, is undoubtedly antithetical to the rule of law and democratic norms, which are the bedrock of the administration he is serving under,\u201d Murktar said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe association is asking that the matter which is in Court 9 of the Federal High Court (FHC) before Justice Taiwo Taiwo should be allowed to be resolved, especially by the Plaintiffs who filed the suit in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe minister\u2019s actions are directly inimical to the economic progress of the sector which is also hinged on the leadership stability of the private sector stakeholders which AFAN represents.\n\n\u201cFarmers as an extension of the national polity, who participated in and voted overwhelmingly for this administration, are irked by the actions of the minister, which is inadvertently truncating the association\u2019s efforts at enjoying internal democracy nationwide.\n\n\u201cTo act in any way by the minister, the Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer or the Plaintiffs themselves, before the determination of the suit is lawless and adjudged a contempt of court.\n\n\u201cJustice must be allowed to take its course if AFAN is to continue to exist as the apex body of all farmer-associations by whatever name called in Nigeria,\u201d Murktar said.\n\nThe body stated that AFAN was registered in 2005 by the CAC with reg: 18160 and three registered Trustees namely Murtala Nyako, Dr Shettima Mustafa and Chief Femi Coker as the apex body of all farmer-associations by whatever name called in Nigeria.\n\nMurktar explained that: \u201cPresident Olusegun Obasanjo advised then that Murtala Nyako should head the management of AFAN as National President and the duo of Chief Femi Coker and Shettima Mustafa to be deputies 1 and 2 respectively pending general election.\n\n\u201cAll other officers were appointed as interim management members in the same manner.\n\n\u201cAFAN elections did not hold until after Abdullahi Adamu former governor of Nasarawa State became the President.\n\n\u201cThe elections from the Wards of 774 LGAs to the 36 states plus FCT took nearly two years to be concluded.\n\n\u201cThe National Election was conducted in 2014 and the elected Executives duly inaugurated.\n\n\u201cFrom this point on AFAN began to be recognized as the umbrella of all farmer-associations in Nigeria guided by its constitution as an NGO.\u201d\n\nAFAN on the May 6, 2021, served the minister a pre-action notice through their attorney A.O. Okeya and Associates for legal actions against his person, for unduly interfering and recognising the Mr Faruk Rabiu faction in the capacity of leaders of the association.\n\nAccording to pre-action notice obtained by LEADERSHIP, AFAN accused the Rabiu faction of circulating letters to AFAN state chairmen across the 36 states of the country including the Federal Capital Territory, under the directive of the minister asking them to purchase inputs supplied by the ministry through them at exorbitant prices.\n\nAccording to the association\u2019s attorney: \u201cWe were informed that on the 26th of April, 2021, the said Faruk Mudi through his Counsel M.M Bakari Esq, wrote a letter to your office intimating you about an election conducted by them, which you directed the Permanent Secretary of your ministry to advise all agencies to recognise this illegal faction, knowing fully well that there is a pending matter at the Federal High Court 9 Abuja.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the above, we demand that you desist from dealing, transacting, aiding and encouraging Faruk Mudi & Co to stop using your office to perpetrate injustice, as the leadership tussle is before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cTake notice therefore that this is a pre-action notice, as we shall seek redress in the law court and demand for damages against your person for aiding Faruk Mudi & Co to defraud AFAN members.

The six-man team was led by the zonal coordinator, Mrs. Chinyere Ibeabuchi.\n\nWhile speaking on the reason for the visit, the zonal Coordinator said NIHOTOUR is having a new lease of life under the leadership of the Director General, Alhaji Nura sanni Kangiwa who has mandated to move out, get acquainted with tourism establishment within the zone and familiarize with activities in these places.\n\nMrs. Ibeabuchi said: \u201cIt is in line with the charge by of director general that we decided to visit the SCOAN. You, through the SCOAN, has contributed so much in the development of Nigeria tourism.\n\n\u201cAccording to independent research, 60 to 70 per cent of inbound tourists visiting Nigeria are pilgrims visiting the SCOAN. This is massive contribution to the socio-economic development of the country.\n\n\u201cThe impact of your ministry could also be seen in and around Ikotun and the environment. The high numbers of accommodation facilities are drawing their clientele from visitors to the SCOAN. Thousands of Nigerians are feeding directly and indirectly from activities at the SCOAN.\n\n\u201cWe all want to use this opportunity to call for assistance for our zonal office. The Federal Government and the leadership of NIHOTOUR are doing very well in funding the institute but we could do with help from you in different areas to achieve our mandate.\n\nResponding to the speech, Prophet T.B. Joshua thanked for the visit, telling the team that he is aware they are operating within the tourism industry but on a different level.

As poverty continues to grow and failure of government becomes apparent, you will not see bandits or terrorists dropping their arms; you will rather see people moving to the other side of the divide.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsecurity is not only a threat to the existence of the people but today one of the most important factors that are precipitating the agitation for the breakup of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a believer in the unity of Nigeria and unity of Africa as a state (the United States of Africa). But there is a need for us to ask ourselves; most of the persons who today have become the face of separatism and breakup of Nigeria were once nationalists and patriots who believed in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom IPOB to Oduduwa group, from Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho, they were believers in Nigeria. What went wrong?\n\nThat is the question we should ask ourselves. Today the military is more interested in constructing event centres, shopping malls, universities and commissioning housing schemes.\n\nYou can hardly see a policeman with a weapon without a tape. Sometimes, you will ask if the paper tape was part of the Nigerian weapon system. This is how low things have become.\u201d\n\nThe Senator condemned the Minister of Finance and the Federal Government for not being able to give an account of how N1.08 trillion released to the Nigerian military within 28 months was utilised.\n\nThe Senator said it was laughable for a country to invest such an amount of money in security agents and still find it difficult to locate and rescue 30 abducted students in 55 days.\n\n\u201cToday in my own part of the country, the northwestern part of the country, bandits have become more than the authority and a state to themselves. Almost 60 to 70 per cent in Niger State senatorial constituencies have been wiped out by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey kill, they terrorise and displace people from their ancestral lands or they give you conditions of living under their authority and command. This is how the state has regressed and this is how the government has abandoned its people,\u201d Sani added.",

Who created 12 states from the four regions by decree?\n\nThe current 36 states and FCT, were all created by military decree; how can anybody who has lived through and who is familiar with our journey as a nation think that the solution to our problems is to handover to the military?\n\nREAD ALSO: Wike: El-Rufai reaping from evil plotted against Rivers\n\nI thought, talking about the rule of law is treason.\n\n\u201cI watched on a national television one of your senior colleagues, Chief Robert Clarke, I was shocked when I saw him calling on the President to handover to the military, I thought that was the hight of irresponsibility, giving his knowledge, giving his age and a very senior member of the bar; what is it that he wanted?\n\n\u201cHe wants a military that will restructure Nigeria. It is again for me senseless because the structure as it is today was put in place by the same military.\n\n\u201cYou know we have freedom of speech but it does not include the freedom to canvass unlawful means to effect a change. When you canvas unlawful means, then you should be arraigned before a court of law and dealt with according to the law. Ignorance is not even an excuse in law.\n\n\u201cI think, even in our moment of distress and regardless of what anybody thinks, the world resolved and Nigeria too, that never again shall we be governed by an unelected government, never, we don\u2019t want unelected Angels,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe former Edo State Governor and Labour Leader further buttressed that many issues suffer under military rule pointing that for a learned icon like Clark to make this call, should appologise to Nigerians.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to have faith in the country, inspite of challenges bedvilling the country, saying, \u201cI won\u2019t give up on Nigeria and we must not give up,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile talking on increasing wave of agitation for separation, Oshiomhole berr\u00e0ted such agitators describing them as \u201cpoor students of history,\u201d saing; \u201cI am also, not agreeing with those who think of dis-membering Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey say let everybody go his way. Nigeria is not a reality. Those ones are poor students of history.\n\n\u201cWhy is Europe spending so much time forming the European Union to create a larger market? Recently we signed the African Trade Agreement so that Nigeria can access a bigger market.\n\n\u201cWe already have a local market of 200 million. If we can keep it flourishing and increase the purchasing power of citizens, we are good to go.\u201d\n\nIn his earlier remarks, leader of delegation, Blessing Agbomhere said the association resolved to have the former APC leader as their guest speaker at a National Conference on Rule of Law because of his antecedent both in and out of government also, as labour leader.",

At the end of the day, God did not allow them to have their way. But see what is happening in his state now. When you are plotting evil against somebody, evil will visit you.

          "text": "By abusing and threatening other Nigerians, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has condemned the remark attributed to Kaduna State Governor Nasir El Rufai that the South-East region will not win the presidency in 2023.\n\nMazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, characterized El-argument Rufai\u2019s as \u201cidiotic and laughable\u201d in a statement released on Friday.\n\nIt noted that the Igbo presidency in 2023 belonged to the Igbo, and that the governor of Kaduna State should stop blackmailing the region and concentrate on the security problems that his state faces.\n\nEl-Rufai spoke during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group and tagged \u201cDeveloping a Viable Nation 2\u201d. Pastor Ituah Ighodalo of Trinity House hosted the event.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gov. Akeredolu\u2019s aide, Doyin Odebowale: slaps pregnant worker who slumps thereafter\n\nEl-Rufai, while responding to a question about why someone of Igbo extraction had not become Nigeria\u2019s president yet, had said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has stopped the South-East from going for the Presidency.\n\nBut you see, you cannot get the Presidency of Nigeria by threats or by shouting victimhood. This is a political process, and you have to engage other parts of Nigeria to convince them to support you.\n\n\u201cI think the South-East is going about it the wrong way because if you look at the APC (All Progressives Congress), for instance, we do not have many footprints in the South-East.\u201d\n\nBut the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, said, \u201cNigerians are aware of the backstage activities of Gov El Rufai as the \u2018Idi Amin of the North\u2019, whose interest is contradictory to the Northern collective interests.\n\n\u201cHe is only pushing the selfishness of the few cabals deceiving President Muhammadu Buhari without any solution to the insecurity challenges in the north and now spreading in the south. We urge El Rufai to fix the Kaduna State insecurity challenges before discussing the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cSoutheast is not alone in the secessionist movements. We have seen Oduduwa and Middle belt ethnic groups displaying flags of Oduduwa and Middle belt nations, as both groups are in the same self-determination struggle as the Igbos.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that in1999, Nigerians voted for Yoruba presidency based on the injustices meted against MKO Abiola which brought Obasanjo Presidency. We are aware that Niger delta struggles brought former President Jonathan to power in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware that Gov El Rufai and other northerners used the Northern insurgency to push President Muhammadu Buhari to power in 2015. It\u2019s time to use the 2023 Igbo Presidency project to end the Biafra agitation, as any attempt by El-Rufai and co-travelers to blackmail Igbos with secessionist movements is dead on arrival.\u201d",

          "text": "A market survey in the region shows that block makers are shutting down\n\nBy Our Reporters\n\nCement prices have increased by 67-100 per cent in the South East states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, hitting as high as N4,500 in Abakaliki.\n\nA market survey conducted by NAN at various wholesale and retail shops in the zone shows that the price of the product has increased almost by 100 % when compared to the price in 2020.\n\nA cement dealer at Kenyatta Market in Enugu State capital, Mr Ifeanyi Amadi said the increase in the product\u2019s price started last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increase in dollar exchange.\n\nHe noted that a trailer load of Dangote cement with 600 bags initially sold at N1.5 million in 2020 but is now N2.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother retailer at Uwani, Samuel Uwakwe, said he was surprised at the rate prices of the product in the country.\n\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\n\nUwakwe lamented that few individuals were given opportunity to supply the product and pleaded with suppliers to reduce the prices and make it available for the citizens.\n\nHe maintained that the prices would likely crash during raining season.\n\nA block maker, Mr Albert Okechukwu noted that increase in the price of the product affected his business as he still sold six-inch and nine-inch block at N170 and N180 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is the same price we sold last year and it is same till date because we cannot change prices in order to retain our customers but most block industries have reduced quality of their blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nA site Engineer, Mr Emma Ugwuoke said he wanted to start a building in the village when the price was N2,800 last year but was waiting to see if it would come down.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back next time, I was told it was N3, 000 and to my greatest surprise, they sell N3,900 and N4,000 now in my village.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing one can do than to buy it like that. I want government to do something urgently about it because it is frustrating buying cement at that price,\u201d Ugwuoke said.\n\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\n\nThose who spoke to NAN said the price hike had further dashed the hope of many Nigerians, wishing to own their personal homes.\n\nA businessman, Mr Victor Ugwu, said he had to suspend his building project because of the \u201cunfortunate development\u201d.\n\nUgwu said: \u201cI have stopped my project for now. I cannot afford to continue with the current price of the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe economy is very bad so I hope to wait until there is a drop in the price.\n\n\u201cI think the hike can be attributed to the monopoly being enjoyed by the cement producers in the country. Unfortunately, there may not be any respite until that monopoly is broken.\u201d\n\nHowever, a cement dealer, Mr James Ogbonna, said the problem had nothing to do with the manufacturers of the commodity.\n\nRather, Ogbonna blamed the price hike on the activities of \u201cshylock distributors\u201d of cement.\n\nHe said that the hike had affected his business adversely, adding that cement patronage had been at the lowest ebb, since the price hike.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first and second week of March, we sold a bag for N3,200, but within the third week we started selling at N3,500.\n\n\u201cBy the end of March, the price moved up to N4,000 and now, we sell between N4,000 and N4100, depending on the brand.\u201d\n\nAnother dealer, Mr Godwin Okafor, said that his sales had dropped drastically as a result of the hike.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of challenges in this cement business now. When we make deposit and order for the goods, it takes about one month before we get delivery,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in Awka in Anambra as stakeholders decry the situation.\n\nMr Kenechukwu Okoye, a cement dealer along Zik Avenue, Awka said before the #EndSARS protest in 2020, a 50kg bag of cement was sold at N2,500.\n\n\u201cShortly after the #EndSARS, the price rose to N3,000 and from there to the present price of N4,000 and N4,100, we are selling today,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye said though the distributors initially blamed the problem on difficulties encountered by the hauling firm transporting the product, the situation had come to stay.\n\nIn Owerri, Imo capital, price of cement is between N3,850 and N4300, depending on the brand.\n\nAt the Building Materials Market in Naze, Owerri North Local Government Area, Dangote and BUA cement are sold at N4,000 per bag while BUA and UNICEM are sold for N3,900.\n\nMr Okechukwu Okonya, a seller, said the cost could be attributed to high cost of transportation as a result of fuel price.\n\nOkonya also said major dealers sometimes hoard the product in their warehouses to create artificial scarcity.\n\nAnother trader, Mr Marcel Iwu, agreed that although there had been hoarding by major dealers, manufacturers had also complained of increased cost of raw materials.\n\nIwu added that the prices could go higher or reduce at any given time, noting that even if prices fall, traders would want to sell off their old stock at higher rates.\n\nIn Abakaliki, Ebonyi, prices of almost all building materials have gone up.\n\nThe prices of cement, rods of various sizes, corrugated roofing sheets and other building materials and accessories according to NAN findings have been on the increase since January.\n\nThe price of Dangote and Bua which sold at N2,500 earlier in November and December 2020 now sold between N4000 and N4500.\n\nSimilarly, Unicem cement which also sold at N2,300 within the same period had also gone up to N4,000 and N4,300.\n\nMr John Okoh, a cement dealer at Kpiri-Kpiri market in an interview with NAN attributed the development to lack of price control mechanism and high rate of exchange rate of the Naira against the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe development is indeed affecting sales and business because many builders have put a stop to their building and other construction projects because they cannot cope with the present high cost of the product.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Clement Igbo, who owns a block moulding factory, said that the high cost of cement was hampering production, saying that he no longer produced maximally due to lack of buyers.\n\n\u201cA bag of Dangote cement which is one of the best products for our business is selling for N4500 and it is difficult to buy at this prevailing price and make enough production.\n\n\u201cWe sell six inch and nine-inch block before this price increase at N150 and N200 but now 6 inch-block is sold at N220 while the 9-inch sells for between N250 and N300 respectively.\n\n\u201cMany block industries in the town have closed down production while some have compromised standard which pose great dangers to the building industry,\u201d Igbo said.\n\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\nMr Jerry Onwe, an economic activist urged the Federal and state governments to revive moribund cement factories across the states to meet the increasing demands of cement consumption in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the quest for mass housing for poor Nigerians would remain elusive if urgent steps were not taken to address the high cost of building materials in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where an average worker earns N30,000 monthly as take-home wage, how can such a person afford a house of his own in view of the prevailing price of building materials?\n\n\u201cWe have reached a cross road as far as the issue of building materials is concerned and this is a time for government to intervene and bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",
          "summary": "\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",

It is indeed true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: nobody is going to be spared, no stone will be left unturned. We shall certainly and aggressively pursue those people that are involved in terrorist financing as far as the Nigerian state is concerned,\u201d he declared.\n\nNigeria has been grappling with series of security challenges ranging from Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast to banditry in the northwest, kidnapping for ransom in several parts of the country, ritual, agitations for secession among several others.\n\nThe country has been battling insurgency for over a decade with over 36,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the northeast.\n\nAs part of measures to rejig the entire security architecture, President Muhammadu Buhari earlier this year replaced his four top military commanders in a bid to better combat the insurgency that has also displaced more than two million people from their homes since 2009.\n\nISWAP split from mainstream Boko Haram in 2016 and became a dominant group, launching attacks on military bases and ambushing troops while abducting travellers at fake checkpoints.\n\nSince 2019, the army has mostly withdrawn from villages and smaller bases into so-called \u201csuper camps\u201d, fortified garrisons meant to give better protection against attacks.\n\nBut critics say the strategy has left jihadists with more freedom to roam untouched in rural areas and made highways vulnerable to kidnappings and assaults.",

I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury\u201d.\n\nThe President stated this on Friday, during the 6th regular meeting with the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC), led by Professor Doyin Salami in Abuja.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Begins Profiling Of Nigerians Linked To Terrorism Financing\n\nPresident Buhari charged the leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noting that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nHe decried the situation in which some unscrupulous people tried to undermine every policy of the government, irrespective of the good it was meant to achieve for the country.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles. I said shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped. People must show consideration for their own country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari pledged that the Federal Government will focus on the greater development of irrigation facilities in the country, and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nHe said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome economic challenges confronting it, stressing: \u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources; Gas, vast arable land, which we are not using enough.\u201d\n\nThe President responding to disclosure by Prof Salami, in his presentation, that only 2% of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives are needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nPEAC submitted that the global economy has continued to improve as COVID infections drop and the roll-out of vaccination intensifies, adding that the Nigerian economy, though out of recession, remains fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are; decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as a basis for revitalizing the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation, and incentives for private investment in irrigation, to promote all-year-round farming.",

          "text": "To fight the pandemic at home, the United States gave its own vaccine manufacturers priority access to American-made materials needed to make the shots.\n\nAs a result, the US government laid claim not only to vast quantities of finished Covid-19 vaccines but also to vaccine components and equipment all along the supply chain, according to a Reuters review of more than a dozen contracts involving some major suppliers.\n\nThat has left some countries desperately in need of those supplies to scramble for substitutes, exacerbating international disparities in vaccine access, according to interviews with suppliers, foreign manufacturers and vaccine market experts.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden threw his support behind waiving patents for COVID-19 vaccines, thrilling those who have been pressuring his administration to help speed production of doses worldwide. If adopted by the World Trade Organization, the move would let other countries make their own copies of the much-coveted shots.\n\nBut the waiver would not address a less conspicuous but equally pressing problem: the growing worldwide shortage of vaccine ingredients and manufacturing equipment. The United States has a tight grip on a significant amount of those materials, such as filters, tubing and specialized disposable bags essential to making vaccines.\n\nCountries ravaged by the virus \u2013 including India, where a catastrophic explosion of cases has filled hospitals and morgues \u2013 cannot make vaccines without such supplies, even with access to manufacturers\u2019 cookbooks.\n\nThe problem stems from the U.S. reliance on a law dating to the Korean War in the 1950s, called the Defence Production Act (DPA), which gives federal agencies the power to prioritize procurement orders related to national defense. For decades, the law was used to supply the military as well as respond to everything from natural disasters to roadblocks in the decennial U.S. census.\n\nThe administration of former President Donald Trump invoked the act to put the U.S. government first in line to buy American-made vaccines as well as other products needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. In turn, vaccine makers have priority access to any supplies needed to fill U.S. orders.\n\nGavi \u2013 a vaccine alliance comprising international organizations, governments, drug companies and others \u2013 lauded the Biden administration\u2019s moves to increase global access to vaccines. Among other things, it cited the country\u2019s $4 billion commitment to COVAX, a global vaccine buying consortium Gavi co-leads with the World Health Organization.\n\nBut in response to questions about the DPA, Gavi said: \u201cThe greatest challenge to COVAX\u2019s goal of equitable access to vaccines is constrained global supply. Export controls on raw materials is a considerable contributor to this and ultimately only serve to prolong the pandemic.\u201d\n\nA senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there is no export ban, and all U.S.-based suppliers continue to ship products abroad after giving priority to U.S. manufacturers. The official said the DPA has not caused the global shortages of vaccine materials, and the problems stem instead from overwhelming demand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not enough to go around,\u201d the official said, noting that the administration is investing in increased raw material production.\n\nOn Wednesday, Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, briefly mentioned in her statement about Biden\u2019s patent decision that the administration would \u201cwork to increase the raw materials needed\u201d to make vaccines. She did not elaborate.\n\nVaccine components are produced all over the globe \u2013 in countries including the United Kingdom and China. But some leading suppliers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N), and the Danaher Corp (DHR.N) units Cytiva and Pall, are based in the United States. Reuters could not determine precisely what share of vaccine materials and equipment are made in America.\n\nThe DPA has helped the United States build a huge vaccine production system, ensuring reliable access to finished doses for Americans, and driving up revenue for U.S. pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAbout 45% of the US population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Dozens of other countries, from South Africa, to Guatemala, to Thailand, have vaccinated about 1% or less of their populations, according to data collected at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe DPA has drawn criticism from vaccine makers around the world, including the Serum Institute of India, the largest manufacturer globally.\n\nOn Twitter in late April, chief executive Adar Poonawalla requested \u201con behalf of the vaccine industry outside the United States\u201d that America lift its hold on raw materials \u201cif we are to truly unite in beating this virus.\u201d\n\nStarting this month, the company had planned to produce a billion doses annually of a vaccine developed by U.S.-based Novavax Inc (NVAX.O). But that output will be more than halved without American raw materials, according to a source familiar with the company\u2019s plans, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nSerum is also manufacturing COVISHIELD, a licensed version of the AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) vaccine.\n\nAfter weeks of public appeals from the Serum, the United States last month offered India filters needed to produce COVISHIELD. But India\u2019s need for vaccines and supplies remains vast. Serum is also meant to be a top supplier to other low- and middle-income countries. COVISHIELD and the Novavax shot form the backbone of the COVAX program.\n\nSerum, which declined to discuss the raw materials issue with Reuters, is not the only vaccine maker in need.\n\nThe South African vaccine maker Biovac Institute also relies on a U.S. company for bioreactor bags, needed for cell cultures. Biovac has been warned by its U.S. supplier that the usual lead time for bags may more than double to 14 months because of the U.S. DPA, chief executive Morena Makhoana told Reuters.\n\nManufacturers in some other countries say they are in better shape. Brazil\u2019s Butantan Institute has been able to buy supplies from both the United States and Europe, an executive told Reuters.\n\nFor instance, an order for supplies to make AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in the United States would be prioritized, even though the shot is not yet approved for use in the country. That could delay materials being sent to Serum, which is making the same vaccine for use in India and many other countries.\n\nFor now, three manufacturers\u2019 COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) \u2013 are approved for emergency use in the United States.\n\nAsked about the global consequences of getting priority on U.S. supplies, AstraZeneca did not comment and Moderna and J&J declined to comment. Pfizer did not directly address the U.S. DPA but said \u201cwe have gone to enormous efforts \u2026 as we seek to serve populations all over the world.\u201d\n\nSome suppliers say the industry would do a better job than governments at managing limited resources to maximize access globally.\n\n\u201cIf the end goal is, let\u2019s produce vaccines, then we\u2019re big believers that you need to let the industry connect the relevant parts so that we can deliver the end product,\u201d Thermo Fisher executive vice president Michel Lagarde told Reuters.\n\nThe Biden administration official said experts from various federal agencies discuss the use of the priority system during daily operations calls. Sometimes officials can change US delivery dates to avoid disrupting other vaccine projects abroad.\n\nBut suppliers are planning to get ahead of demand. Leading purveyors Cytiva, Pall and Thermo Fisher are expanding manufacturing space in the United States and abroad. Thermo Fisher has nudged customers to clarify which needs are urgent and which can wait days or weeks, and the company tries to find time to fill orders even if they are not rated as priorities, Lagarde said.\n\nCytiva said in a statement that it is expanding production, but is itself limited by some raw materials shortages.\n\n\u201cThe world is experiencing an unprecedented demand for biopharmaceutical products, technologies, and solutions,\u201d Cytiva said.\n\nReuters",
