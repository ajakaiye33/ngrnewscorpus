          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Adebanjo, Nnamani, Empire Kanu, others warn against special military operations\n\n\u2026Dialogue, rather than military action should be way out \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\n\u2026Let govs take charge of their security \u2014Afenifere\n\n\u2026Don\u2019t be selective in handling situations \u2014PANDEF\n\nBy Anayo Okoli, Regional Editor, South-East, Dapo Akinrefon, Dennis Agbo, Davies Iheamnachor Ikechukwu Odu & Steve Oko\n\nLast week\u2019s announcement by President Muhammadu Buhari that the Federal Government is coming up with new security measures for the South-East and South-South zones is eliciting strong reactions from across the country.\n\nIt will be recalled that after the President\u2019s meeting with service chiefs and heads of other security agencies at the President Villa in Abuja, the National Security Adviser, Major-General Babagana Monguno, retd, had told State House correspondents that the the military had been to use discreet operations to tackle the security challenges in the two zones but failed to reveal the scope of the operations.\n\nHowever, Igbo socio-political and cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and its counterparts in the South-West and South-South, Afenifere and the Pan-Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, have warned the military against any special military operations in the two zones that may affect innocent citizens of the two zones.\n\nAside from these groups, some prominent Igbo leaders also told the military to apply caution and tackle the insecurity in the South-East professionally as elsewhere in the country.\n\nOhanaeze warns against military offensive\n\nReacting to the presidential directive, the Chidi Ibeh-led Ohanaeze Ndigbo cautioned the military against any offensive, saying such action would have fatal consequences on the unity of the country.\n\nThe group said \u201cthere are traps by enemies of President Buhari to push him to regrettable actions that will provoke avoidable civil unrest and war.\u201d\n\nThe group said the Federal Government should rather engage in dialogue with Igbo youths, rather than any discreet operation, particularly in the South East.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the security council members are keeping undisclosed offensive action which is not necessary in the South-East.\n\n\u201cHiding the new military actions and decisions for the zone which was arrived at without any South-East person in the security council meeting is an affront on Ndigbo, and we urgently ask President Muhammadu Buhari to restrain further military actions and opt for youth empowerment programmes and use carrot and stick policy for the South-East.\n\n\u201cWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari to allow South-East governors handle the situation to avert reinforcing arms struggle in the zone.\n\n\u201cWe have the magic wand to end the insecurity in the South East. We urge President Buhari to invite Igbo leaders and youth leaders in the zone for dialogue and stop further marginalisation of South-East.\n\n\u201cThe proposed new security measures will worsen the situation which bandits and killer herdsmen who were sponsored to destabilize South-East have created. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to believe that the recent security council meeting was targeted at the resolutions of Southern governors at Asaba.\n\n\u201cWe are offering President Buhari a helping hand by seeking dialogue, rather than shoot-on-sight that will provoke Igbos,\u201d group said in a statement signed by Okechukwu Isiguzoro.\n\nLet govs take charge of their security \u2014 Adebanjo\n\nIn his reaction, Acting Leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, urged the President to allow governors take charge of their security.\n\nHe said: \u201cIs he (Buhari) telling me that he can keep the house better than the owner? Everybody has been talking about regional police and state police, let the governors take charge of their own security. \u201cWhat is your business arranging it for them? You cannot sit in Abuja and be controlling the security in Owerri or Epe. Allow the governors to take charge of their security.\n\n\u201cYou cannot know my house better than me. I don\u2019t regard that as an improvement on security.\n\n\u201cLet the governors take charge of their security as it is done in all federations. What is your particular interest in taking charge of their security?\u201d\n\nSelective approach won\u2019t help \u2014 PANDEF\n\nSimilarly, the Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, advised the Federal Government to stop being selective in handling issues that affect the country.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, in Port Harcourt, noted that the problem that had affected the country was the selective approach of FG to handling issues in he country. Robinson said: \u201cThe federal government should not be selective. This is one of the problems of this country. \u201cThe the main issue that is causing disaffection, dissolution and the hopelessness in the country, is the biased manner issues are being handled.\n\n\u201cWhy the selective setting up of security arrangements for South-South and South-East? What of North-West and North-Central and North-East?\n\n\u201cThe country needs a new security arrangement and we and we said when the new service chiefs appointed that it is not about the new service chiefs, that it is about the whole security architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cStudents in schools and innocent Nigerians are being kidnapped and livelihoods are being decimated in the North-West, people are being killed in the North-Central and of course Boko Haram is having a field day in the East.\n\n\u201cWhy the selective approach to set up special security for the South-South and South-East?Nigeria is at war and the Commander-in-Chief should realize this and begin to act dispassionately and address the insecurity situation in the country. \u201cWe are not in any way happy with what is happening. The lives of every Nigerian important. PANDEF has long before now condemned the attacks on security formations and we restate that position and condemn it.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable. But the Nigeria Government must stop this selective approach in handling situations in he country. Nigeria is one country and the security system needs to change. The attitude of the president and those in government needs to change.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble and the sooner we realize it and begin to act decisively in a manner that will satisfy everyone the better for us.\u201d\n\nNo to discreet operations \u2014 ABIA CAN\n\nAlso reacting, Abia State chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Apostle Emmanuel Agomuo, warned the military not engage in the use of discreet operations, saying it would lend credence to the alleged shoot-on-sight order given by the military on Igbo youths.\n\nAgomuo cautioned the military to drop such contemplation as it would not bring any solution to the tensed situation but rather escalate it\n\nAccording to him, such action is not justifiable as the military has not taken similar measures in the Northern region where Boko Haram and bandits had sacked and occupied many communities and kidnapped many for ransom.\n\nThe cleric said singling out the South-East and South-South for special treatment is suspicious and suggests a sinister motive.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they shoot-on-sight in Borno and other Northern states where Boko Haram has taken over many local government areas and hoisted their flags?\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in the South-East and South-South has happened in greater measure in the North but nobody was shot on sight. This is uncalled for. It can be controlled without shoot-on-sight or adoption of any special discreet operation,\u201d the Abia CAN chairman said.\n\nHe urged the military high command to drop any idea of using discreet operations in the zones to avoid collateral damage that might make the situation worse.\n\n\u201cThey may see a Keke operator and want to stop him, and kill him in the process and allege anything they want,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe also condemned the order said to have been given by the Acting Inspector General of Police, withdrawing security aides from VIPs in South-East and Rivers State, saying the move portends danger.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal order is suspicious and only further confirms marginalization of the South-East,\u201d Agomuo said, even as he called for unity among Ndigbo to be able to go through the trying times. \u201cThe South East must come together now. This is the time to unite, not some going to Abuja to sing one tune and others singing a different tune\u201d, he cautioned.\n\nDiscreet operations can be misinterpreted \u2014 Nnamani\n\nAlso reacting to the issue yesterday, former Senate President and a chieftain of All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr. Ken Nnamani, said he would rather advise the military to use proper and effective intelligence gathering than whatever discreet military operation in dealing with the security challenges in the South-East and South-South regions of the country.\n\nNnamani warned that using discreet military operations in the regions would be misinterpreted to mean ethnic cleansing.\n\nAlternatively, he advised that the option of stick and carrot be applied to look for solution.\n\n\u201cIntensified information gathering and the use of modern technology will be more effective and advisable in dealing with the insecurity in the South-East and the South-South. \u201cDiscreet military operations could be misinterpreted as ethnic cleansing. Certainly, not good for the image of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cAlso, carrot and stick approach should be considered. In this case, a contact group, made up of highly credible indigenes of South-East and South-South, should be put together to start holding difficult and honest conversations with the promoters of the senseless violent acts in the zones. These will achieve more lasting peace in the country,\u201d Nnamani counselled.\n\nNo justification for discreet operations \u2014 Kanu\n\nSimilarly, an industrialist and former ambassador to Brazil, Chief Empire Kanu, described as untenable the plot to apply different secret measures to confront the security challenges in the South-East and South-South, saying he does not believe in such a thing.\n\nAccording to him, the military has no moral justification to single out South-East for shoot-on-sight order or any discreet military operations to tackle the security challenges in the area, while the North has become a slaughter ground by terrorists without the military taking a similar action.\n\nKanu, however, condem-ned attacks on security formations in the zone and other parts of the country, but challenged security agencies to first establish the source of the attacks before rolling out military actions.\n\nHe said if they want to shoot-on-sight, it should apply to all parts of the country and not limited to South-East and South-South alone, otherwise, it would be interpreted as a deliberate action to further persecute Ndigbo.\n\nElder statesman, Chief Tony Ukasanya, in his contribution, said dialogue remained the best option to quell the rising wave of insecurity in the country.\n\nUkasanya, a founding chairman of PDP in Abia State, advised the military to drop confrontational approach and device a way of engaging agitators of self determination in various regions of the country, with a view to listening to their grievances.\n\nHowever, a prominent traditional ruler in Enugu State, Igwe Spencer Ugwuoke, said that it would be too early to condemn decision of the last National Security Council meeting until the outcome was unveiled and discreet operations interpreted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon, Johnbosco Agbakwuru, Marie-Therese Nanlong\n\nThe former Chief of Defence Staff, CDS, during the Government of late General Sani Abacha, Lt-Gen. Joshua Nimyel Dogonyaro has passed on. He was aged 80.\n\nDogonyaro\u2019 first son, Joseph who confirmed the demise of the former Defence chief, said \u201cDaddy has been sick for some time until yesterday (Wednesday) when he had a stroke and we rushed him to the Jos University Teaching Hospital, JUTH, for medical attention. Unfortunately, early this morning (yesterday), around 3.00am precisely, he breathed his last.\n\n\u201cHis death comes as a rude shock to us as a family. We are going to miss his love and warmth as a grandfather, father, brother, uncle and supporter.\u201d\n\nJoseph said that the family is trying to cope with the shock death of General Dogonyaro, who was a former ECOMOG commander, and would discuss the funeral arrangements soon.\n\nHe described his father as \u201ca General who was so faithful and loyal to the nation, Nigeria. He was a general who had no biased mind as a detribalised Nigerian. He served this nation faithfully and identified with all Nigerians and Africa as a continent. We and Nigerians are going to miss him, having served humanity in this country and Africa as a whole.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the corpse of the general had since been deposited at the JUTH mortuary.\n\nLate Lt. Gen. Dogonyaro, a soldier and an administrator, was born on September 12, 1940 in Vom, Plateau State, though a native of Taroh in Langtang North Local Government Area.\n\nDogonyaro had his early education at Boys\u2019 Secondary School, Gindiri, and thereafter was enlisted in the Nigerian Army, NA, 1964.\n\nHe was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Nigerian Army Armoured Corps, 1967 and promoted Lt. General in 1988, before his retirement in 1993.\n\nA thoroughbred soldier \u2014 Buhari\n\nReacting, President Muhammadu Buhari, described Dogonyaro as a thoroughbred soldier who professionally distinguished himself in the course of his military career, saying his death was \u201ca great loss not only to the Nigerian military, but also to the country because of his patriotic sacrifices in defence of its unity and territorial integrity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, in Abuja, the President said:\n\n\u201cThe death of Dogonyaro comes as a great shock to me because as a soldier, I know what it means to lose such an officer and a gentleman who gave his best in the service of the country.\n\n\u201cAs a thoroughbred soldier who had professionally distinguished himself in the course of his military career, the President notes that \u201claying down one\u2019s life for the country is one of the greatest sacrifices any citizen can make to his country. General Dogonyaro\u2019s incalculable contributions will be remembered for years to come.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nPresident Buhari extended deepest condolences to the Government and people of Plateau State on the passing of \u201cthis legendary general.\u201d\n\nPlateau lost a patriot \u2014 Lalong\n\nOn his part, Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, in a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Makut Macham, among others, said \u201cPlateau State and the nation has lost a patriotic and loyal Nigerian who served with courage, dignity and selflessness. Plateau State has lost an elder statesman whose outstanding achievements in his military career brought a lot of pride and honour for the State. The commitment of the deceased towards the defence of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity as well as ensuring its peace and unity stood him out as a soldier of repute whose professionalism continues to inspire many younger ones.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Senator representing Plateau South in the National Assembly, Nora Dadu\u2019ut, who is representing the deceased zone added, \u201cNigeria has lost a statesman. With the death of General Dogonyaro the Nigerian army has lost a General; the nation has lost a statesman. The late elder statesman recorded outstanding achievements in the Military.\u201d\n\nWuyep, Jang, Useni\n\nSimilarly, former Chief of Air Staff, CAS, Air Marshal Jonah Wuyep (retd), former Governor of Plateau State, Senator Jonah Jang and former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Senator Jeremiah Useni lamented his death\n\nWuyep, a Tarok by tribe just like deceased noted that General Dogonyaro, a former ECOMOG Commander served not just the country but the West African sub-region meritoriously while Jang, a former Military officer added that the deceased was a father and mentor to all military officers from his Plateau State and beyond.\n\nAlso, Useni, a member of the erstwhile \u2018Tarok Mafia stated he was a courageous officer who made success of every operation he commanded, adding General Dogonyaro was \u201cA rare, daring, intensely loyal and courageous officer who made success of every operation he commanded.\u201d\n\nHe was a first class combatant \u2014 Bode George\n\nOn his part, former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Olabode George, in a statement, among others, said \u201cThe passage of General Joshua Dongoyaro, a first class combatant, a warrior standing ramrod, towering over six feet tall, bristling with bravery and valour has indeed robbed this nation of a patriot, a soldier and an administrator.\n\n\u201cI met him when I served as the Governor of the old Ondo State where I benefited greatly from his guidance and well-hewn experience as he commanded the Second Mechanized Division based in Ibadan. Though he looked tough, intimidating in height, he could be humble and stern; he was disciplined and yet accommodating.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Restructure first at state level, elected officials shouldn\u2019t lead agitation \u2014 LAWAN\n\n\u2026Agitations may be genuine but govs shouldn\u2019t join calls for restructuring \u2014 GBAJA\n\n\u2026Adds: \u201cwe\u2019re all to blame\u201d\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nPRESIDENT of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday faulted the Southern Governors Forum for calling for restructuring of the country, saying it is wrong for elected officials to lead such agitation.\n\nLawan also said the worsening security situation in the country is a result of lack of functional local government system, even as Gbajabiamila argued that though the agitation for restructuring might be genuine, elected leaders and state governors should not be the ones to champion the movement for restructuring without first replicating the idea at the state level.\n\nThe speaker further said that the present situation does not warrant name calling, but rather, the coming together of all stakeholders to find solutions to it, admitting that everyone is complicit.\n\nThe two spoke in an interview with State House correspondents after the Eid-el-Fitri prayers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. According to the Senate President, the security challenges in the country can be attributed to the absence of a functional local government system.\n\nHe said while the nation\u2019s leaders seek solutions to the security crisis confronting the nation, the local government system should not be neglected.\n\nHe explained further that the lack of autonomy potentially inhibits solutions as well as efforts by the federal and state governments towards addressing the nation\u2019s security challenge.\n\nLet the LGs function at state level \u2014 Lawan\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all leaders and we are in this together, the solutions must come from us regardless of what levels of leadership we are \u2013 whether at the federal, state Level, or even local government level.\n\n\u201cI also want to take this opportunity to say that we have diminished the local government system. I think we can attribute the security issues to the absence of a functional local government system.\n\n\u201cI think the time has come for us to take up the challenge and ensure that the local government system functions. This is as we look for ways to curb the security challenge.\n\n\u201cWe must never neglect the local government system. We must go back to our local government system to ensure they are autonomous and functional.\u201d\n\nOn the call by the Southern Governors Forum for restructuring of the country, Lawan said: \u201cI believe that, as leaders, especially those of us who are elected into office, should not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cBecause, even if you are a governor, you are supposed to be working hard in your state to ensure that this restructuring you are calling for at the federal level, you have done it in your state as well.\n\n\u201cWhat you may accuse the Federal Government of, whatever it is, you may also be accused of the same thing in your state.\n\n\u201cSo, we are supposed to ensure that we have a complete and total way of ensuring that our systems at the federal, state and even local government levels work for the people.\n\n\u201cWe must allow people to participate in governance so that whoever feels he has something to offer to make Nigeria better does so freely without any let or hindrance.\u201d\n\nUrging elected leaders to shun regionalism, Lawan added: \u201cThe President is reaching out to all the stakeholders, and I believe that as leaders, particularly those of us who were elected at all levels of government, we should avoid partisanship.\n\n\u201cWe should avoid regionalism. We are all leaders and we are in this together. The solutions to our challenges must come from us regardless of what level of government we are.\n\n\u201cWhether at the federal, state or the local government level, I believe that Nigeria is going to come out of these challenges stronger.\u201d\n\nLawan further advised Nigerians to support efforts at ensuring the desired autonomy for local governments in the country.\n\nGovs shouldn\u2019t join calls for restructuring \u2014 Gbaja\n\nAlso speaking, speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said those championing the call for succession might be misguided and do not mean well for the country.\n\nOn the call for restructuring, he said there might be genuine agitations but explicitly stated that elected leaders and state governors should particularly not champion the movement for restructuring without first replicating the idea at the state level.\n\nHe called for a national spirit of oneness, saying \u201cif truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame for what\u2019s happening today.\n\n\u201cWhatever challenges we have, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve these issues we\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cWe must imbibe that spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity and love that would take us through this.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said the Eid celebration should be a period of sacrifice, love, and worship amid the spate of insecurity in the country, adding that it was not the time for name-calling or trading blames as everyone is complicit.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The journey from the Obong Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo was filled with great expectation, as stories about Eket, a town about 45 minutes drive from the Akwa Ibom State capital painted the picture of a sprawling oil city.\n\nOur correspondent\u2019s co-traveller, a famous Nollywood veteran actor was about getting disappointed when he discovered that the destination was actually not Uyo, which he was initially made to believe. But our reporter was, however, quick to assure him that they were actually heading to an oil city, reminding him that it was the same town where Dare Adeboye, Pastor Enoch Adeboye\u2019s son, died two days earlier.\n\nThe high expectations couldn\u2019t have been faulted, as Eket plays host to Mobil Unlimited, one of the major oil multinationals prospecting crude oil in the country. So it was naturally expected that the town, a local government headquarters, will be swimming in \u2018oil money\u2019.\n\nThe great expectation, however, gave way to despair, as they gradually entered the town and caught the first glimpse of where they would be domiciled for the next one week.\n\nLiving short of its fame\n\nFor any first time traveller to that part of Akwa Ibom State, one of the most assured feelings will certainly be that of disappointment, as the reality with Eket and its people paints totally a different picture of the fame and expectation of splendour and plenty many Nigerians have from afar.\n\nAside the beautiful edifices scattered around the town and owned mostly by politicians and government appointees, not much gives out Eket as oil producing community, a sad reminder of the situation in most Niger Delta oil producing communities.\n\nThe town still paints the picture and stubbornly retains all the trappings of a rural community that only has the opportunity of hosting an oil company and by extension, Nigerians from other parts and expatriates who work from their community. This has, however, failed to impact on the community in terms of infrastructure and human development, neither has it impacted on the economy of the town.\n\nLiving in squalor amid plenty\n\nOkon Edet, alias Hunter, is a retired fisherman, who claims to have travelled to different West African countries on fishing expeditions, including other riverine areas of Nigeria. Though he is in his early 40s, he cuts the picture of a man in his late sixties.\n\nHunter, as he is fondly known, struck a cord with this reporter, as he found a listening ear, as he fondly talked about his many fishing trips and life after retirement as a fisherman.\n\nThis reporter\u2019s path crossed his as the scorching Eket sun on Thursday, forced him to sit in what looked like nearest to nature, a place Hunter gleefully introduced as his compound. Sitting on the more than a plot of land, is a \u2018bungalow\u2019 made with planks and asbestos and rustic iron sheets. Hunter\u2019s bungalow, a one room shanty, without toilet and kitchen facilities, is adorned all around by what looks more like a plantain plantation, where he also has other food plants.\n\nCuriously, Hunter\u2019s abode, where he lives with his five children, all under 12 years of age, sits directly opposite one of the biggest and most beautiful houses in Eket, belonging to a former governorship candidate in the state, painting a contradictory picture. The same magnificent edifice Hunter claimed to have provided security for while it was being built.\n\nFor Hunter, life in Eket is totally different from what people think it is from outside, as nothing is happening, especially for the indigenes, who mostly are out of work and only managing to survive on a daily basis. This, he demonstrated when this reporter called for a drink for himself and his new found friend. It was, however, shocking when he returned with just one bottle as against two. Asked why he didn\u2019t buy his own, he said his children queried him if they will not eat when he told then to buy two bottles. So he chose to buy one and use his to look for what they will eat.\n\n\u201cMy brother, you don\u2019t know what you have done for me and the children this afternoon. It\u2019s like God sent you to us\u201d, he said thankfully after this reporter called one of the children and handed her the money to cook.\n\nSpeaking further, Hunter said it is only the politicians, the big men and Mobil workers that can boast of living a good life in Eket.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is high and I get to meet people every time who come from outside the state but most times they are disappointed. People actually believe things are rosy here but at least, you can see for yourself. Apart from politicians and oil workers, who are not from here, nobody has anything to show for the status of Eket, as a host to Mobil,\u201d he said.\n\nMobil and its COVID-19 excuse\n\nResidents of Eket, in chats with DAILY POST revealed that most of the indigenes of the town who were working with Mobil have been home since 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the order of the company. They, however, said other workers from outside Eket, mostly Yoruba, who they said formed the bulk of the work force, have continued working.\n\nRex, is a local politician, with a small chops business as a side hustle, something he said he survives with at the moment. According to him, Mobil has compounded the poverty level in the town after dislodging indigenes from the services of the company hiding under COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 came, indigenes who were working with Mobil were asked to stay at home and they have remained at home without salaries or any compensation after unjustly and cleverly laying them. And to our surprise, every morning, you see long convoy of escorted coaster buses carrying Yoruba people to work. If our people cannot work, why allow others. Or are the Yoruba still working in the company immune from COVID-19?\n\n\u201cWe have tried to make representations to the company but they seem not to be interested in dealing with our complaints and that has been their style over the years. They are taking our peaceful nature for granted and when pushed to the wall, we know what to do\u201d, Rex said.\n\nAlso commenting on the treatment by Mobil, a former staff of the company, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, Akpan, said youths of the town are already becoming restless and unless something is done urgently by the company to address the issues on ground, its continued unhindered operation may not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cMobile has been toying the familiar line of most oil companies operating in the Niger Delta, refusing to give employment to indigenes of oil producing communities. In the case of Eket, the little jobs, which were mostly low cadre ones that we had have been taken away from us, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse.\n\n\u201cWe were not told we have been sacked but that is what it has turned to because we are not being paid but the Yoruba people and others continue to go to work and have been collecting their fat salaries. It is unfortunate that the company is treating us with contempt just because they believe that we are helpless. When it is time, they will know we are not helpless, as their military escorts will not be strong enough to withstand the popular revolt of the people.\n\nUdom Emmanuel Indicted\n\nSeveral residents of Eket are also quick to score Governor Udom Emmanuel low in performance in office so far, insisting that he has neglected the area since he came into office.\n\nAccording to many of them, whatever can be seen in Eket and its environs as traces of development were done by the administrations of Obong Victor Attah and Godswill Akpabio, noting that Governor Emmanuel has neglected them.\n\nOkon, a commercial motorcycle operator in Eket, while chatting with this reporter, said he and most of his colleagues chose to take to commercial motorcycle business because they have nothing else to do and that the state government has not done anything to empower citizens.\n\n\u201cYou can see a large number of \u2018Okada\u2019 riders in town, both the very young and fairly old. Many of us took to this business because of lack of what to do. No job and the state government has done nothing to help empower us to do other things that are more dignifying. I have my National Diploma, but I ended up doing this.\n\n\u201cEven if you can\u2019t get me a job, empower me to be self-employed, make our roads motorable, make life more meaningful. The problem is so much that an average young girl in Eket, from the age of 18 is a potential prostitute. Many of them took to what they call hustling just to survive. You will be shocked that some of them are actually living with their parents and most times, they contribute to what goes on at home from their hustling. It is really a sad situation. We have the name and the fame, but sadly, it does not reflect on our daily lives. That fame is not real,\u201d Okon declared.",

To me, you don\u2019t just say restructuring, we need to have a national dialogue first.\n\n\u201cI know that we have one during the time of former President, Goodluck Jonathan, but, where is the report, the book is gathering dust.\n\n\u201cTo me, I will tell you that there are a lot of benefits if we are together.\u201d\n\nAdegoke, while speaking further, maintained that Nigeria is currently experiencing many problems because we are not operating federal system of government the way it supposed to be.\n\n\u201cThe problem in Nigeria is that we are not actually implementing the federal system of government very well. We are not following it.\n\n\u201cIt is unitary system that we are operating. You say that we are running a federal system of government but, states are not in control of resources in thier states.\n\n\u201cThat is not how it should be. States will be going to Abuja every month to collect allocation. That is the problem, because states will become lazy because they know that they will collect money in Abuja at the end of the month.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari reveals handicap in fighting insurgents",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, blamed the delay in supply of military hardware by manufactures for the handicap the administration is facing in fighting Boko Haram, bandits and other violent crimes in the country.\n\nHe stated this shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast at Aso Villa, Abuja, yesterday, while calling for understanding by Nigerians.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said: \u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order for weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers to ship them, and when brought here, eventually, they are taken to training institutions, where we train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process. I expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at time and available resources.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we came in, in the North East, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest, and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nHe, however, vowed to use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits, to ensure that they do not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming farming season.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement coming after nearly six years in power is, however, seen by many as contradicting his 2015 election promise of ridding the country of all forms of terrorism and insurgency within the shortest possible time. Under his reign, violent crimes have been on the increase, spreading from the North East to North West and, lately, South east and South South where Fulani herdsmen and bandits have invaded communities, farmlands and schools, killing and kidnapping hundreds for ransom.\n\nThe president, while expressing the hope for a good rainy season this year, said \u201cthe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land, so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today, both on security and the economy, and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for its support, saying emphatically that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has thanked God for enabling them witness the end of Ramadan.\n\nShe appealed to Nigerian women to take responsibility of their children by guarding and protecting them against abuse and other vices.\n\n\u2022Young farmers urge emergency plan to forestall food crisis\n\nThe Nigeria Young Farmers Network has said an emergency national food security plan, that would actively engage the private sector, is critical to forestall the nation\u2019s imminent food crisis.\n\nThe Director General (DG) of the network, Mr Promise Amahah, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAmahah spoke against the backdrop of the relentless increase in prices of food and agricultural produce in Nigerian markets, which he warned might lead to a national food crisis very soon.\n\nHe said that government alone could not achieve reasonable progress in this regard, adding that more intensive action was required to address the challenge.\n\nAmahah said the Federal Government needed to provide the enabling environment for companies and startups providing solutions like storage facilities, logistics, payments, among others.\n\n\u2022Onyewuchi harps on justice, fairness\n\nThe Senator representing Imo East Senatorial District, Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi, has commended the Southern Governors Forum for what he described as their principled and patriotic position on various issues bedeviling Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Chiaka Alozie, the senator insisted that in line with the position of the governors, only justice and fairness can guarantee the unity and progress of the country.\n\nOnyewuchi bemoaned the hardship faced by millions of Nigerians, adding that there is an urgent need to address the rising insecurity, economic downturn and increasing agitations by different ethnic nationalities, for the restructuring of the country.\n\nHe said that Nigerians yearn for a country that works for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic and religious backgrounds, while taking into consideration the sensitivity of the diversity of the country.\n\nHe urged the southern governors to continue to work with other stakeholders to ensure that the dream for a better Nigeria is realised.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nPresident Muhammadu\u2248 Buhari, yesterday, joined other Nigerians to mourn former Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Lt. General Joshua Dogonyaro, who died at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) at the age of 80.\n\nThe president described Dogonyaro as a thoroughbred soldier who professionally distinguished himself in the course of his military career.\n\n\u201cThe death of Dogonyaro comes as a great shock to me because as a soldier, I know what it means to lose such an officer and a gentleman who gave his best in the service of the country.\u201d\n\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said his death was \u201ca great loss not only to the Nigerian military, but also to the country because of his patriotic sacrifices in defence of its unity and territorial integrity. Laying down one\u2019s life for the country is one of the greatest sacrifices any citizen can make to his country. General Dogonyaro\u2019s incalculable contributions will be remembered for years to come.\u201d\n\nAlso, framer governor of Abia State and Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Kalu, commiserated with the government and people of Plateau State over the demise of the former CDS.\n\nAccording to Kalu, the deceased was a gallant army officer who served in various capacities in the military.\n\nIn his condolence message, the former governor condoled with the family, friends and associates of the late military officer, while praying for eternal rest for the deceased.\n\n\u201cI condole with the Dogonyaro family over the demise of their patriarch, General Joshua Dogonyaro (retd).\n\n\u201cThe late military officer served in various positions in the Nigerian Army during the military era. He was a gallant officer and seasoned administrator. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Dogonyaro family at this sorrowful time.\u201d\n\nKalu prayed to God to grant the deceased\u2019s family the fortitude to bear the loss\n\nPlateau Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, expressed deep shock over the death Dogonyaro.\n\nLalong, in a statement in Jos, said Plateau State and the nation have lost a patriotic and loyal Nigerian who served with courage, dignity and selflessness.\n\nHe recalled Dogonyaro achievements during his career in the Army where he held several command positions and accomplished his assignments with tremendous success.\n\nFormer governor of Plateau, Jonah David Jang, described the death of Dogonyaro, as a great loss to Nigeria in the fights against insecurity.\n\nJang, in the statement in Jos, said the country would miss his wealth of experience in the search for peace and unity.\n\nHe was the Chief of Defence Staff during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.",

At certain level, people will be talking, but we only know the beginning of a war, not the end. Nobody will remember how the war in Syria started and it is still on for years. And everything they built is being destroyed. So, I think we have to do it softly. We have started democracy. We are not happy with the way it is going.\n\n\u201cBut even Quran says there will be time when God will give you good leaders; there will be time when the leaders that you are given by God are not as good because He wants you people to see the difference. We should assume that this too will pass. It started six years ago. In another two years, it will go.\n\n\u201cIf you are saying because of that you want to go or you don\u2019t want to go, who even tells you that the North is not even getting ready to go? Let us look at it, people in the South are talking too much, and people up North are acting too much.\n\n\u201cIn Yorubaland, we talk too much. The North is also preparing to leave and they are working at it. Do you think it is a mistake that they are constructing railway to Niger Republic when we have not built railway from Ibadan to Kano, not even Abuja, and they said it is the first place we are going to spend our money?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the refinery in Kaduna be repaired? Why are they saying they would build another refinery in Daura (Katsina State)? And they would be bringing crude oil from Niger Republic to the place. Don\u2019t let us deceive ourselves, maybe a time will come when all of us will sit down together and separate peacefully.\u201d",

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi, Obinna Odogwu, Awka, Felix Ikem, Nsukka, Lukman Olabiyi\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday, applauded the decision of the southern governors to ban open grazing, saying any Nigerian opposed to their position has a hidden agenda.\n\nThe governor, who stated this at Holy Ghost Parish Hall, during the \u2018Media Week and Communications Day 2021\u2019 organised by the Directorate of Social Communications, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi, said his colleagues from the southern part of the country had towed the right path towards addressing insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nOrtom, who noted that open grazing is no longer feasible in the country due to development and population growth, said Nigeria is a great country with great potentials and should, ordinarily, have no business with poverty, if only there was guaranteed security for lives and property and the people allowed to remain stable in their localities, to explore opportunities in farming and other ventures.\n\nThe governor thanked the Church and Muslim community, as well as residents and citizens of the state, for remaining supportive of his administration.\n\nHe also commended the good reportage of government policies and programmes by the Directorate of Social Communication, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi and all the media groups in Benue, maintinaing that his administration would always welcome constructive criticism.\n\nA youth body, under the aegis of Save Enugu Youth Initiatives also commended the governors\u2019 recommendation for the restructuring of the country, state policing and the jettisoning of open grazing as panacea for the lingering insecurity across the federation.\n\nThe youth body described as factual, the problems identified by the governors, while urging the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, muster courage and embrace the timely calls by the southern leaders, to save the nation from sliding into a ditch.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun in Nsukka, yesterday, the Convener of the group, Gwiyi Solomon, who was flanked by the state coordinator of the group, Comr. Chibueze Nwoga, commended the southern governors for demonstrating genuine leadership and exemplary representation, especially as it concerns burning national issues.\n\n\u201cWhat the southern governors resolved at Asaba, in Delta State, on Tuesday, is the only way out of the debacle in which we found ourselves in the current Nigerian nation.\n\n\u201cTheir resolutions are far-reaching and shouldn\u2019t be swept under the carpet by the federal government if, indeed, they love and have Nigeria at heart. A resolution to ban open grazing is the way to go; a resolution calling for restructuring and national confab are both timely and necessary now,\u201d Gwiyi concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) and the Agbekoya Farmers Society described the ban of open grazing as a welcome development that would go a long way in checking insecurity across the entire southern Nigeria, but also sought the governors permission on the use of juju to enforce the ban and deal with criminal/ defiant herdsmen ruthlessly.\n\nOPC Publicity Secretary, Yinka Oguntimehin and the National Secretary of Agbekoya, Prince Adegbenro Ogunlana made the pledge at separate interviews with Daily Sun. Oguntimehin said:\u201d It\u2019s a very welcome development, and we believe it would go a long way in checking issues of insecurity. If we get the government\u2019s backing, we will use all we have, including juju, to tackle insecurity.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ogunlana said: \u201cIt\u2019s a good step taken in the right direction by the governors if they are sincere with their decision and not just playing politics, as usual.\n\nNobody is against anybody; all we care for is security of life and property. The South is not against the North. Apart from ban on open grazing and other resolutions of governors, the farmers should also be compensated for their loss in the past; government should support us. If government can back us, our traditional ways of protecting life and security are still with us, and we are ready to unleash it, if permitted by the government.\u201d\n\n\u2022New confab not necessary- Ozekhome\n\nHowever, Constitutional lawyer and rights activist, Mike Ozekhome, yesterday, advised the 17 governors in the Southern Nigeria to perish their call and expectations for another constitutional conference, stressing that they should rather demand the implementation of the 2014 confab.\n\nOzekhome, while speaking on the topic \u201cLegal Profession in a Lawless Society, in Awka, Anambra State capital\u201d, during the 25th Law Week of the Awka branch of the NBA, where he was a keynote speaker, said that the implementation of the recommendations of the 2014 confab convened by former President Goodluck Jonathan, would go a long way in solving the country\u2019s challenges.\n\nOzekhome said: \u201cI was at the 2014 national conference headed by late Justice Idris Kutigi, and the over 200 recommendations we made at that conference are yet to be touched.\n\n\u201cSo, when I heard the 17 southern governors talking about another conference\u2026 I know they mean well for the country; but we do not need another dialogue.\n\n\u201cLet them go to the 2014 recommendations, they will see that we recommended state police and part-time legislature. The Constitution made the sitting of member of the National Assembly six months, but they are receiving fat salaries.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022President pleads for more understanding, says time needed to take delivery of weapons\n\n\u2022Vows to resist bandits\u2019 threat to food security\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari and state governors to address the security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nThe Sultan spoke yesterday as the president pleaded for more elite understanding on raging strife in the country, explaining that time is needed for equipment procured, to fight agents of violence to submission, to be delivered.\n\nAbubakar in his Sallah message in Sokoto yesterday said the security challenges had continued to remain a great concern to all.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari and all the state governors to, as a matter of urgency, bring to an end the insecurity across the country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAs our leaders, you should continue to remain resolute and more committed to your various responsibilities of protecting the society.\u201d\n\nThe monarch cum spiritual leader said the president and the governors should enhance their commitment toward the restoration of the peaceful nature that the country was long known for.\n\nHe called on Muslims to pray more for their leaders to cope with their responsibilities.\n\nHe urged Muslims to continue to sustain the spirit of charity, generosity, hospitality and brotherhood that Eid-el-Fitr symbolises.\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for all of us to celebrate, show love, support and relate with one another, as such we should sustain the commitment for our best desire,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sultan urged the residents of Sokoto State to strictly adhere to the COVID-19 protocols and guidelines throughout the Sallah celebration.\n\nPresident Pleads for More Understanding\n\nBuhari, however, called for more understanding by Nigerians, especially the elite, as his administration battles to end the siege on the nation by non-state actors behind banditry, insurgency and kidnapping.\n\nHe stated that the elite should understand the military operation as it takes time for equipment procured to tackle insecurity to arrive in the country.\n\nHe expressed the readiness of his administration to resist the threat by bandits to disrupt national food production in the coming growing season.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen yesterday after observing the Eid prayer to end the Ramadan fast at the State House, Abuja, the president pledged that his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not create havoc against access to farms and food production.\n\nHe assured Nigerians that the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\nThe president, who hoped for a good rainy season this year, said: \u201cThe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nCommenting on ongoing efforts by his administration to tackle the security crisis, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying part of the resolutions reached at the meetings had been made public by the National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), and the others kept secret.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nHe commended the National Assembly for its support, saying: \u201cThe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nBuhari appealed to the elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers (to produce them). It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources.\n\nFor example, when we came in, in the North-east, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States, and the South-south, in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment are what is happening in the North-west and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nBuhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; the Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.\n\nBuhari, Aisha Step out Together First Time in Months\n\nFor the first time in months, Buhari yesterday stepped out with his wife, Aisha, to celebrate this year\u2019s Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nBuhari shared many photos on social media where he and his wife were surrounded by their children and their spouses.\n\nIn some of the photos, Buhari was also seen with his grandchildren.\n\nIn a string of tweets, the president congratulated all Muslims on the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid festival and prayed that it will bring with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst others.\n\nHe sought \u201cunity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians,\u201d adding that these virtues are imperative \u201cespecially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Cartel records lowest quota compliance in 12 months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry growth declined by 19.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to data from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOPEC, in a country-by-country analysis of developments within its member countries in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), said the previous month, it fell by 13.9 per cent, although the non-oil sector grew by 1.7 per cent.\n\nThe report showed that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.1 per cent year-on-year in Q4, 2020, following a 3.6 per cent contraction in Q3, 2020, which was the first positive quarterly growth in the last three quarters amid the gradual return of economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil sector expanded 1.7 per cent, recovering from a 2.5 per cent decline in 3Q,2020, mainly driven by growth in the telecommunications and information services sectors.\n\n\u201cOther important contributions came from the agricultural sector, which expanded by 3.4 per cent y-o-y in 4Q, 2020. Meanwhile, the oil sector dropped by 19.8 per cent y-o-y after a 13.9 per cent y-o-y contraction in 3Q, 2020,\u201d the report for May stated.\n\nIt stated that in 2020, the economy contracted 1.9 per cent y-o-y, following a 2.3 per cent y-o-y expansion in 2019, while inflation was still structurally high in the first quarter of this year, with the annual inflation rate jumping to 18.17 per cent in March 2021, the highest rate since January 2017 amid the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has also weakened the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, a surge in oil output by Russia and Oman in April lowered the compliance rate to the OPEC+ production cuts, with the nine non-OPEC countries that participate in the cuts overproducing by 347,000 barrels per day, equating to a compliance rate of 85 per cent, the lowest level for the 12 months that the pact had been in force.\n\nCompliance among the 10 participating OPEC countries, by contrast, was 123 per cent, thanks largely to the Saudis\u2019 additional voluntary reduction of one million bpd in February-April, which came on top of its official OPEC+ cut of 1.88 million bpd.\n\nThe average compliance rate for the entire OPEC+ group fell to 110 per cent in April from a record high of 113 per cent in March.\n\nThe non-OPEC partners\u2019 poor performance is certain to aggravate the Saudis and other Mideast and African producers, which have hit their targets in recent months which could create a tense atmosphere during future negotiations about opening the taps in the second half of the year.\n\nSaudi Arabia is looking to unwind its voluntary cut of one million bpd in May-July, which will necessitate winning back market share that it ceded in Asia when the voluntary cut was enacted in February.\n\nAlso, oil prices dropped by almost three per cent yesterday and were set for the biggest percentage drop since early April, after the restart of Colonial Pipeline, eased some of the concerns about petrol shortages in the U.S. East.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, West Texas International crude was falling by 2.94 per cent at $64.14 while Brent Crude was down by 2.64 per cent at $67.49.\n\nOil prices snapped the winning streak from earlier this week when reports from both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reiterated the view that global oil demand would rebound strongly in the second half of the year with more economies reopening and increased travel amid higher vaccination rates.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s bullish outlook on demand, coupled with a similar view from OPEC from Tuesday, sent oil prices to an eight-week high on Wednesday, almost hitting $70.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Boko Haram Scare: Law School DG Insensitive, Says NBA Chairman",
          "text": "Eromosele Abiodun and Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikeja Branch, Mr. Bath Aguegbodo, has accused the Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Professor Isa Ciroma (SAN), of being insensitive to the danger students billed to write their examination next week at the Bwari campus of the school would be exposed to due to the scare of bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\nHe said the students should be allowed to write the examinations scheduled to start from Monday at other campuses due to the reported security scare in the Bwari area.\n\nAguegbodo stated this yesterday when he appeared on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a breakfast programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think it would be out of insensitivity on the part of the director-general to continue to insist that the exams would be taken. If you look at the Chibok issue, there was intelligence information to both the security agencies and the management of the school that they were open to attack and they ignored it. I think it is important for everybody to apply pressure on the DG to see reasons.\u201d\n\nThe examination, he stated, must not take place in the Bwari, adding that there are other campuses where security concerns are not as serious as they are in Bwari.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit sad looking at things the way it is panning out; the security of students writing exams in Bwari should be paramount. I have listened to comments credited to the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, and the guarantees are given that security will be provided for students who will write the exams in Bwari.\n\n\u201cBut the question on my mind in the issue is security from where? Just last week, we heard there were attempts in the Villa. The Niger State governor had also said on two occasions that there were some communities in Niger State, which is less than two hours from where the law school is located, that has been taken over by the Boko Haram people,\u201d he said.\n\nAguegbodo added that the argument that JAMB is located at Bwari and some other universities that are located there have not shut down does not hold water.\n\nAccording to him, the psychological state of the students writing the exams must be considered.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat would be the mind of students writing exams when they have fears that they may be kidnapped?\n\n\u201cThe essence of the exams is to assess students as to their preparedness on what they have been taught. I do not see how a fair assessment would be done when a student is writing exams knowing fully well that the bandits are just about two hours away from them.\n\n\u201cThe unsettled mind would definitely reflect in the final result, which would not bring a fair assessment of what the exams are meant to achieve at the end of the day. If they could take their lecture in their various campuses, it would be the necessary thing for the government to look at it, that it is the safety of citizens first before the exams.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Council of Legal Education, attorney-general and the director-general of Nigerian Law school is that the safety of the students must be put into place if the examination is to be a fair assessment of what they have learned.\u201c\n\nHe also canvassed the postponement of the examination by one or two weeks.\n\nSpeaking on who should bear the cost, if the students were to be relocated to other campuses, he said it was the duty of the government to provide a conducive environment for the examinations to hold, adding that if the environment is not conducive, the government would have to bear the cost.\n\nParents of students at the Bwari campus had called on the management of the school to relocate the students to its other campuses owing to reported security scare in the area.\n\nThe worried parents, who insisted that the safety of their wards should be the priority, stated that they did not want to go through the same harrowing experience of parents of the Greenfield University students abducted by bandits in Kaduna recently.\n\nBoko Haram scare has created panic among the residents of the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in recent weeks.\n\nBwari town, an outskirt of Abuja shares a boundary with Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INVESTIGATION: How Rivers State Revenue Officers Divert Millions Of Government Funds Into Private Bank Accounts",
          "text": "In this three-month investigation, this reporter used a pseudonym name, Rose John, poses as a Diploma Student in Ken Polytechnic and paid a total sum of N195,000 to get a tax clearance certificate from two separate staff of Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue offices in Port Harcourt. However, out of the N195,000 paid, only N30,300 went into the coffers of the Rivers State Government. TCC office at the headquarters also collaborates with branch tax officers to cheat the Rivers Government. The reporter had disguised herself to look like the ignorant Nigerian which the tax officers took advantage of.\n\nThe Rivers State Government has several times warned tax officers to stop collecting cash from taxpayers. Rather, they should direct any payment to the Government designated bank, but the tax officers are illegally charging residents and then failing to remit to the government. This, they do in connivance with some bank officials.\n\nBetween August and September 2020, the Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike borrowed over N24billion to accelerate development which included construction of flyover, dualisation of road and compensation to families of demolished buildings among others. Nyesom said the fund will be repaid from the Internally Generated Revenue. What this means is that, with the constant IGR being diverted into an individual account, the Governor might not pay the loan on time. And this will affect development in the state.\n\nInside the Rivers State Secretariat, close to the Podium Block, there is a branch office of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office. Immediately the reporter got close to the entrance of the tax office, she was accosted by a dark female security lady, in blue and black trousers.\n\nThe security officer requested to know the office the reporter was heading to, and when the reporter told her she wanted to get a Tax Clearance Certificate, she was directed to a then pregnant lady called IB, chocolate in complexion.\n\nThe Discussion with IB\n\nThe reporter told IB that she wants to get a tax clearance for herself and her sister who is also a student, and it is part of a requirement to apply for a scholarship abroad. IB told her each TCC will cost N150,000 each, even when the reporter pleads that they want to use it to apply for a scholarship and they are yet to know their fate whether they will be chosen or not.\n\nThe reporter had earlier visited the state revenue branch at Aggrey Road, a fair in complexion officer told her Tax Clearance Certificate for students is free, and all she needed is to submit the school admission letter and payment of school fees receipt.\n\nBut, this is different from what the tax officer(IB) inside the state secretariat told the reporter.\n\n\u201cI will bring the price down to N100,000 each since it's for both\u201d, IB said. The reporter pleaded for the money to be reduced yet it wasn't. IB told the reporter that the amount mentioned, she will still go and discuss with her boss and plead with him to accept the amount.\n\nAfter much argument, the reporter requested IB to give her the state government's bank account number to make payment. IB bluntly told the reporter that she can't pay to the bank because they don't know her, rather she(IB) is the one the reporter needs to pay to the bank. This is contrary to what the Rivers State Government jingles says. The state government has severally said it has no agent representing the government in collection of taxes. The government has warned tax officers not to collect cash rather they should direct the payer to the bank.\n\nIB wanted cash but the reporter intentionally requested her bank account details.Happily, IB, gave the reporter her personal Guaranty Trust bank account details; Diri Ibieri Tonye. IB for short, came from Ibieri, our report understands. The reporter made a transaction of N80,000 on September 17,2020, and to also document cash received, this reporter called IB and informed her that she couldn't make the transfer again if she could bring cash immediately. Same day, the balance of N20,000.00 was given to Ibieri. This was also captured on camera.\n\nTax clearance certificate collected from IB without TIN.\n\nEvery taxpayer is expected to use their Rivers Tax Identification Number to pay their taxes. The reporter was hoping IB would request for RIVTIN but she didn't. Neither did she ask for a document to prove that the reporter\u2019s sister was a student.\n\nAlthough the reporter went with a computerised and edited scanned document as an Admission letter and an edited passport picked from the internet, IB failed to confirm if really the reporter is fake with intention to cheat the government. This act has been perpetrated by several scammers who cheat the government and most times in connivance with the staff of the Rivers Internal Revenue Board\n\nSurprisingly, two days after, IB called this reporter to come pick her tax-clearance certificate that it was ready. Ibieri persuaded the reporter to come to do the second TCC since the previous was ready. The reporter had told IB that once the TCC was ready, she would come to the second TCC for herself.\n\nThe reporter visited IB and she gave the reporter the Tax Clearance Certificate of 3years, starting from 2017, a hundred thousand Naira (N100,000) receipts from Internal Revenue Revenue, and also an stamped Access bank teller to prove to the reporter that she paid the money to the government designated bank as said earlier.\n\nTracking the Stamped Access Bank Teller\n\nThe location of the bank teller states Bank Road. Bank road is close to the state secretariat opposite the Rivers State Judiciary complex.\n\nThe reporter went into the bank to find out the authenticity of the bank teller. The first customer care she met was close to the entrance of the bank, a fair complexioned lady told the reporter, the bank teller is authentic.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see our stamp on it? said the Access bank customer care personnel, without confirming the authenticity of the receipt from the computer.\n\nBut the reporter insisted that she check the system before assuming the bank teller is authentic. The bank official reluctantly told the reporter to move to the extreme of the counter to meet the cashier for confirmation. And this reporter did.\n\n\u201cWhere did you pay this money? The receipt can't be found, said the bank cashier whom the reporter had handed over the bank teller given by the revenue officer, Ibieri. The reporter told her the revenue officer gave her the teller that the money was paid in this branch.\n\nThe reporter insisted the bank cashier should check using the name on the teller, the number and the stamp yet the bank cashier insisted that all had been done yet she could not see any of the names used in payment and the teller number was not recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, Diri Ibieri Tonye used Rose John as given by the reporter to pay the money. What this means is that the N100,000 the reporter paid for Tax Clearance was not paid to the government's bank account; rather, it was paid to the Tax officer of Rivers State Internal revenue board.\n\nThe bank teller and computer printout given to the reporter by IB were also fake, and this can be possible with the help of a bank official.\n\nOn a separate day, the reporter visited the Rumuogba board of Internal Revenue close to Mini-okoro police station. Immediately she entered the reception by the right is an office occupied by two tax officers, a man and a fair woman.\n\nThe reporter moved to the first person, a dark man and told him she wanted to get a tax clearance and he pointed to the other lady, fair in complexion, who identified herself as Legbosi.\n\nLegbosi was attending to a customer, immediately the reporter met her and told her she wanted TCC for herself and her sister, and they are students. This reporter made her aware of the urgency of the TCC to enable her to apply for a scholarship abroad. Immediately, Legbosi brought out a pen, wrote down her telephone contact and told the reporter to go home and call her at 4pm. Earlier, Legbosi had told the reporter to get the school admission letter, ID card and receipt. The reporter, knowing she can't easily get the school ID card, she quickly told Legbosi that she is yet to be given an ID card from the school since 2018.\n\nThis reporter was disguised and looked unkempt when she visited Legbosi's office and pretended to be among the ignorant Nigerians. So, Legbosi, a senior tax officer, decided to take advantage of her looks to cheat her.\n\nIn the evening, this reporter called Legbosi who told her to pay N150,000 after much pleading, the reporter stood her ground on N95,000 and the tax officer, Legbosi agreed. It took over two months before Legbosi agreed for N95,000. This was when the reporter suddenly visited the tax office and told her what they agreed on the phone was N95,000. Legbosi could not remember how much she had told the reporter.\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the reporter visited the tax office, hoping that the state government account would be given to make payment. Legbosi requested cash. The reporter told her to give the state account to make payment but Legbosi said the money was to be paid to her while she would pay to the bank. Just like her colleague Ibiere at the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office inside the state secretariat.\n\nThe reporter requested her bank account and she refused and told the reporter to go across the office and do a withdrawal. Outside the office is the police microfinance bank. The reporter went outside and withdrew the N90,000 and intentionally left N5,000 to be transferred into Legbosi bank to have proof.\n\nTCC collected from Legbosi with TIN\n\nImmediately, the reporter brought out the cash to give Legbosi, she brought out an envelope and requested the cash to be put inside. Our reporter put the cash inside and handed over the money to Legbosi, and told her the ATM failed to transfer the remaining N5,000 if she can share her account details for the balance to be paid. And she did it on a sheet and this reporter transferred the N5,000 balance.\n\nThe Rivers Board of Internal Revenue has also announced that acquiring a Tax Identification number is free, and it is also stated on her facebook page. Legbos asked the reporter to pay two Thousand to get RIVTIN before payment of the Tax payment to get a TCC.\n\nUnfortunately for Legbosi, the reporter had visited the Head office of the State revenue Board as regards TIN and it was done free. The reporter told Legbosi that her sister has a TIN. Legbosi shockingly looked at the reporter but she still couldn't understand the naive lady in front of her. The reporter gave her the TIN\n\nUnfortunately, the reporter didn't notice the money was short of N10,000 and Legbosi called the reporter and informed her. The reporter checked the bag where she brought out the money and saw the extra N10,000. The reporter again requested the tax officer to text her bank details to transfer extra N10,000.\n\nLegbosi sent a text of her Savings First bank account details; Legbosi Ikpabie. This reporter paid and she confirmed seeing the money via text message.\n\nUnlike IB who did not ask for a document to prove that the reporter's relative was a student; Legbosi asked. And the reporter gave her a fake Admission letter, school fees receipt all picked from the internet and edited, and a fake home address.\n\nGetting TCC at Rumuogba\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Legbosi texted the reporter that the TCC is ready. Days after, the reporter visited Legbosi at the tax office and collected the TCC. Only N30,300 was reflected on the receipt given.\n\nEarlier, Legbosi called and told the reporter that out of the N95,000 paid, N50,000 had no receipt, claiming the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office does not give receipt for penalty. She claimed the N50,000 was for penalty for failure to pay tax. Meanwhile, Legbosi never told the reporter that N50,000 would be used for the penalty. She lied again. All monies paid for any purpose in the state had a receipt especially when it was said to be paid into the bank.\n\nThe bank teller brought by Legbosi only reflected N30,300 not the N95,000 as claimed earlier.\n\nThe reporter through her TIN checked the amount paid by Legbosi online, only N30,300 was reflected, and the N50,000 penalty was never stated\n\nRIVERS STATE BOARD OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RSB\n\nRIRS Head Office\n\nRSBIR on her facebook page said it is committed to being the credible Tax Administrator and helping the good people of Rivers State understand and become responsible TAX PAYERS.\n\nThe State Government has made several efforts to ensure residents and businesses owners pay their taxes into the right bank. However, this is done through jingles in various media outlets but there are some ignorant people who would still go to the board office and seek direction to confirm the amount needed to be paid. Rather than the Revenue officers to give direction on the right payment, some officers like Legbosi and IB will still deceive and illegally charge residents yet fail to remit to the government.\n\nThe official website of the RIvers State Board rolled out banks where taxpayers can make payment. The reporter visited the headquarters of the State Revenue board at Trans-Amai to speak with the Executive Chairman, Adoage Norteh to inform her findings. The secretary to the Chairman, an advanced woman denied the report access.\n\nWhen the reporter visited State Revenue headquarters on Friday 27, October, 2020, about 1pm, some security officers told the reporter that the Chairman was in his office. The reporter introduced herself and told the secretary that she has information for the chairman. And the secretary asked the reporter if she was on appointment, the reporter said, No, and the Chairman\u2019s secretary replied, \u201cThen, you can\u2019t see him\u201d. The reporter told her she had important information to inform the chairman, the secretary said the chairman was not around.\n\nHow Headquarters collaborates with branches to defraud citizens and the Government\n\nThe reporter also put a call across to the numbers displayed on the facebook page of RSBIR identified as Joseph Iyeuma, a lady picked. This reporter asked the lady if students are to pay for TCC, and she said No with the submission of a school document. This confirms that Legbosi and Ibiere cheated taxpayers and converted taxpayers\u2019 monies to individual pockets.\n\nAgain, the reporter requested the method to dictate the authentic TCC document, and the Tax officer told the reporter to visit the TCC office at the Board headquarters, and this reporter revisited on Monday November 4, 2020.\n\nImmediately the reporter entered the reception, she asked one of the tax officers seated, the way to the TCC office, and the fair in complexion lady asked the reporter the reason for the visit. When the reporter told the officer she wanted to inquire about the authenticity of the TCC received, she was directed to the first floor.\n\nThis reporter also climbed the first floor, and the security lady on the first floor showed her the TCC office and she entered and walked straight to a young man seated close to the wall by the right, immediately you entered the TCC office. She told the tax officer that she wanted to confirm the authenticity of TCC she had gotten from other branches. \u201cMeet my boss\u201d, the tax officer said, pointing to a man at the extreme of the office.\n\nAnd, the reporter walked to the man who later identified himself as Leyiri. The reporter told Mr. Leyiri she wanted to confirm the authenticity of the TCC, he requested for the copy, and the reporter gave him the TCC she had collected from Ibiere Tonye at the revenue office at State Secretariat. He started typing a code from the TCC into his computer, afterwhich, he told the reporter to officially write to the Chairman that he is not in the position to confirm the authenticity.\n\nHaving seen several TCC on Leyiri's desk, this reporter asked him if all the TCC comes from his office. He said all TCC comes from his office after heads of the branches have done and confirmed all the process but \u201cthat is after the Chairman has approved\u201d, he said.\n\nHe told the reporter that the TCC is original. \u201cAre you scared, it is okay? Dont waste time going through the process of writing to the chairman\u201d, Leyiri said, discouraging the reporter with a smiling face. He lied. The TCC from IB is fake as it has no TIN on it. The documents including the bank receipts from Ibiere are fake. The reporter also confirmed from the bank that the teller is fake. Leyiri is also covering up the crime from tax officers cheating the government.\n\nHowever, if the TCC from Ibiere Tonye is authentic as claimed by Leyiri, that means tax officers at the Head of the Revenue Board collaborate with officers at various branches to defraud ignorant Nigerians and divert public funds into personal accounts against the government's directive thereby causing the government to lose billions.\n\nThis reporter also did not identify herself as a journalist when she revisited the Headquarters of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office to avoid harassment.\n\nDocuments: IB Fake Bank Receipt by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nDOCUMENTS: RBIR LEGBARA by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThis report is supported by HEDA Resource Agenda in collaboration with the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.",

The reporter told her she had important information to inform the chairman, the secretary said the chairman was not around.\n\nHow Headquarters collaborates with branches to defraud citizens and the Government\n\nThe reporter also put a call across to the numbers displayed on the facebook page of RSBIR identified as Joseph Iyeuma, a lady picked. This reporter asked the lady if students are to pay for TCC, and she said No with the submission of a school document. This confirms that Legbosi and Ibiere cheated taxpayers and converted taxpayers\u2019 monies to individual pockets.\n\nAgain, the reporter requested the method to dictate the authentic TCC document, and the Tax officer told the reporter to visit the TCC office at the Board headquarters, and this reporter revisited on Monday November 4, 2020.\n\nImmediately the reporter entered the reception, she asked one of the tax officers seated, the way to the TCC office, and the fair in complexion lady asked the reporter the reason for the visit. When the reporter told the officer she wanted to inquire about the authenticity of the TCC received, she was directed to the first floor.\n\nThis reporter also climbed the first floor, and the security lady on the first floor showed her the TCC office and she entered and walked straight to a young man seated close to the wall by the right, immediately you entered the TCC office. She told the tax officer that she wanted to confirm the authenticity of TCC she had gotten from other branches. \u201cMeet my boss\u201d, the tax officer said, pointing to a man at the extreme of the office.\n\nAnd, the reporter walked to the man who later identified himself as Leyiri. The reporter told Mr. Leyiri she wanted to confirm the authenticity of the TCC, he requested for the copy, and the reporter gave him the TCC she had collected from Ibiere Tonye at the revenue office at State Secretariat. He started typing a code from the TCC into his computer, afterwhich, he told the reporter to officially write to the Chairman that he is not in the position to confirm the authenticity.\n\nHaving seen several TCC on Leyiri's desk, this reporter asked him if all the TCC comes from his office. He said all TCC comes from his office after heads of the branches have done and confirmed all the process but \u201cthat is after the Chairman has approved\u201d, he said.\n\nHe told the reporter that the TCC is original. \u201cAre you scared, it is okay? Dont waste time going through the process of writing to the chairman\u201d, Leyiri said, discouraging the reporter with a smiling face. He lied. The TCC from IB is fake as it has no TIN on it. The documents including the bank receipts from Ibiere are fake. The reporter also confirmed from the bank that the teller is fake. Leyiri is also covering up the crime from tax officers cheating the government.\n\nHowever, if the TCC from Ibiere Tonye is authentic as claimed by Leyiri, that means tax officers at the Head of the Revenue Board collaborate with officers at various branches to defraud ignorant Nigerians and divert public funds into personal accounts against the government's directive thereby causing the government to lose billions.\n\nThis reporter also did not identify herself as a journalist when she revisited the Headquarters of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office to avoid harassment.\n\nDocuments: IB Fake Bank Receipt by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nDOCUMENTS: RBIR LEGBARA by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThis report is supported by HEDA Resource Agenda in collaboration with the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.",
          "summary": "TCC office at the headquarters also collaborates with branch tax officers to cheat the Rivers Government.\nInside the Rivers State Secretariat, close to the Podium Block, there is a branch office of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office.\nThe reporter told her the revenue officer gave her the teller that the money was paid in this branch.\nJust like her colleague Ibiere at the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office inside the state secretariat.\nThe reporter told her she had important information to inform the chairman, the secretary said the chairman was not around.",

          "title": "Bob Marley: Memories Of A Memorial By Remi Oyeyemi",
          "text": "\u201cOf his many musical creations, it may be said that special places are reserved for four: Trenchtown Rock, the symbol of his life; No woman no cry, his comforting hands of compassion; One love, his vision of peace and unity, and Rastaman vibrations, his deep mystical faith.\u201d - Edward Seaga, Jamaican Prime Minister at Bob Marley\u2019s Funeral\n\n\u201cWe all die. The goal isn\u2019t to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.\u201d - Charles Michael Palahniuk, American Freelance Journalist and Author.\n\n\u201cMostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.\u201d - Arthur Schopenhauer, German Philosopher\n\nBOB MARLEY\n\nDateline: May 11, 1981. The evening was seeped in its own silence. Its demeanor was celebrative as if in stubborn defiance of the mourning of the faithful. The evening, exuding zest for life, adopted an obvious indifference to the feelings of the adherents of a Prophet. It bubbled and burbled. It seethed and simmered with the usual smoldering social life of a Great Ife evening.\n\nBut the sky seemed to have a different attitude. The sky, this early evening, appeared to be in turmoil. It seemed conscious of the prevailing sadness among the faithful. It looked as if in mourning too. The clouds seemed possessed, as they engaged in rambunctious wrestling matches. It could also be that the clouds were in hot exchanges as to the rationale of calling this Prophet home so soon, just after thirty-six years of sojourn on the planet earth.\n\nAs the sky progressively darkened, it was certain that it was cocooned in its own expression of sorrow and despair as the stars lined up to illuminate the skylines. The stars, exuding the traits of trained troopers, seemed to have arranged themselves as Guards of Honour to celebrate the passing of an Avatar. A sage. Teacher. Guide. Healer. Preacher. Philosopher. Freedom fighter. Social critic. Thinker. Crusader. Lover. Musician. Prophet.\n\nThe stars, seemed to acknowledge the simultaneous melancholic mood of the faithful and their determination to celebrate the passing away of their hero, their icon. An idol, who inspired courage of resistance against social injustice. An Evangelist who vitiated modern slavery. A pastor who preached against apartheid. A Champion against colonialism. He was a Razor against racism. An Advocate against poverty and exploitation. An Apostle of redemption. A Missionary of and for mental freedom.\n\nComing from the Great Obafemi Awolowo Hall to join others in front of the Students Union Building, I had to go through the Iva Valley. Iva Valley was named after a valley in Enugu area which bears the same name. It was the site of the Iva Valley Coal Mine. It was where the events of November 18, 1949 occurred, when 21 miners were shot dead by colonial policemen while striking. The Iva Valley Coal Mine was created in 1917, two years after the Udi Coal Mine was created in 1915 by the British Colonial Administration.\n\nPassing through, it was obvious that this Great Ife Iva Valley was in a different mood from that of Enugu of November 18, 1949. The Suya sellers were brisk in their businesses. The drinking spots were agog. The food vendors were catering to their customers. Many of them were unaware of the tragedy of his departure. Some of them, aware of it, were probably discussing it over plates of pepper soup and cold beer or soft drinks.\n\nBut the name Iva Valley brought home the reality of his exit as I walked spryly through. The many battles he had chosen to fight. The preachments of liberation to which he had dedicated himself as he sang, \u201cOpen your eyes and look within: Are you satisfied with the life you are living?\u201d The songs that he sang against colonialism and oppression. \u201cWe free our people with music,\u201d he had lyricized. The courage he had imbued against apartheid by \u201cchanting down Babylon.\u201d The inspiration he had enkindled against exploitation by confronting the oppressor, \u201cNow you look me with your scorn, then you eat up all my corn.\u201d His lessons of History as regards the slavery of the Negroid as he waxed \u201cOld pirates, yes, they rob I, sold I to the merchant ships.\u201d The gospels of freedom and social justice that he sermonized and spread through \u201cGet up, stand up, stand up for your right\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe enormity of the loss became stark. It hit home. It became grim and gloomy in its distinctiveness. It gave a feeling of dingy dreariness. It created a weird feeling of despair and frustration. There were wild rumours of the involvement of American Central Intelligence Agency in his death. With the age-long atrocities of that arm of American Government in Africa and other parts of the world, it was difficult to dismiss those rumours, no matter how outlandish they were. Then, his Redemption Song came to heart wherein he had asked: \u201cHow long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?\u201d\n\nIn front of the SUB were the faithful, discussing his passage. Obviously, his passage had as sad effect as it could have on those of us gathered. We stood in close proximity in twos, threes and fours as he was analyzed and evaluated. His preachments of and about peace. His songs of freedom and liberty for the Africans all over the World. His philosophy against oppression and stand for social justice. His love songs. His previous escape of assassination on December 3, 1976, a little over four years earlier. And once again, speculations of the heinous acts of American CIA were rife.\n\nHow he would likely be remembered was a subject of interest to all. Many agreed and actually believed that he could not be forgotten because his music would continue to be relevant. Some felt he was just a social critic who made a difference, no more, no less. Others felt his depth was as deep as that of a philosopher. Yet, others were of the view that because of what he preached he could not have been anything other than a Prophet. There were those who suggested that because of his manifestations of wisdom on many sociological issues, he would be remembered as a sage.\n\nBut Rita Marley, the only constant lady in the firmament of his short life among his many women, believed that Bob Marley would like to be remembered as a \u201cLover.\u201d A \u201clover\u201d of humanity as emblematic in his song of unity in the track of \u201cOne Love\u201d where he preached \u201cOne love, one heart; Let's get together and feel all right\u2026. I'm pleading to mankind (one love); Oh, Lord (one heart); Give thanks and praise to the Lord, And I will feel all right.\u201d\n\nOr as a lover of women for whom Bob had sang so many songs. The tracks \"Turn Your Lights Down Low\", form the Exodus album, \u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d and \u201cMisty Morning,\u201d from the Kaya album, had reportedly been written and sang about and for Cindy Breakspeare, the Canadian-Jamaican who became \u201cMiss World\u201d in November 19, 1976, with whom Bob Marley fell in love. Rita Marley (who generally turned a blind eye to her husband's dalliances, because she had a couple of her own), had turned rebellious at the recording of \u201cWaiting In Vain\u201d when she found out it was again written about Ms. Breakspeare, the mother of Damian Marley and had to be begged by Bob before she could participate. But Rita always refused to sing the track whenever the song was performed live. She never did.\n\nAs the evening progressed, one of the faithful with a very powerful cassette player, treated the rest of us to a number of his songs. At a point, he mounted the cassette player on his shoulder as we all danced to the music. With his music blaring, we marched through the Sports Hall to Adekunle Fajuyi Hall to Moremi Hall. From Moremi Hall to Obafemi Awolowo Hall. From Awo Hall to Angola and Mozambique Hall to the Post \u2013 Graduate Hall. From Post Graduate Hall we marched back to the SUB where the celebration of the legend, Robert Nesta Marley, continued into the night.\n\nTo appreciate the Legend of Bob Marley, and the persistence of his extant social, political and spiritual impact on our world, it is interesting to know that there have been an estimated 500 books (not articles, journals, documentaries, or pamphlets but just books) published about him, according to an October 29, 2018 disclosure by the 78 year-old Brooklyn, New York born American author, broadcaster, historian, archivist, Roger Steffens. There exists the evidence that Bob Marley would live forever, in those books, in his songs and in the philosophy that he preached.\n\nIt is forty years ago today that he passed on, and the memories of an impromptu memorial for the Great Robert Nesta Donald Marley also known as Bob Marley or Tuff Gong (6 February 1945 \u2013 11 May 1981), still subsist, fresh in our consciousness.\n\nBob Marley lives on!",

We may not always agree on all issues, but for once, let us agree to make Nigeria work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough tribes and tongues may differ, in brotherhood we stand as one, in order to lead the way for other African countries to follow suit. The only hope Africa as a continent has is that Nigeria will one day lead the way for the liberation of the continent economically and politically. Our country is indeed a force to be reckoned with not just in Africa but the world. Therefore, we must change the ugly narrative of disunity among our people to be able to provide the much-expected leadership for the continent. However, we must set our house in order; charity they say begins at home.\n\nTherefore, we must put our differences aside, and focus on the bigger picture which is to build a heterogeneous society; where the oppressed will no longer be oppressed, where there will be equal right, fairness, and justice for all, where no one will be discriminated against based on his or her tongue, where the majority and the minority will both have their say on how the country is governed, where as citizens, we will be able to live freely in any part of the country without any fear of threat to life and property.\n\nHowever, it is reassuring to see leaders rising up to speak on the need to chart a new course for the country. I am particularly, impressed by the resolution reached by the southern governors during their recent meeting in Asaba, Delta state to lend their voices on the way forward for the country. We hope this will not be a mere talk but matched with the required action plan for us to see the result. The governors must endeavor to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d for them to be taken seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, I look forward to seeing their counterparts from the north do the same in the interest of the country. This is a collective responsibility we all owe the country. No matter your political, economic, religious, or social status, you and I have a role to play in rebuilding our country into a more peaceful and prosperous nation to the delight of our people, the African continent, and indeed, the international community.\n\nNigeria is currently bleeding but we have a duty as a people to stop the bleeding by our actions and inactions. This is our home; we have no choice but to make it work again.\n\nThere is only one solution to the multifaceted problems beleaguering this country and once the solution is applied, every other thing will naturally fall in place. Restructure! Restructure!! Restructure!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet the restructuring process begin in earnest.

          "text": "In 1842 Thomas Babington Macauly wrote my favourite poem titled \u2018Horatius at the Gate\u2019 and made a point that we can all learn from in Nigeria today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cThen out spake brave Horatius,\n\nThe Captain of the Gate:\n\n\u201cTo every man upon this earth\n\nDeath cometh soon or late.\n\nAnd how can man die better\n\nThan facing fearful odds,\n\nFor the ashes of his fathers,\n\nAnd the temples of his gods,\n\n\u201cAnd for the tender mother\n\nWho dandled him to rest,\n\nAnd for the wife who nurses\n\nHis baby at her breast,\n\nAnd for the holy maidens\n\nWho feed the eternal flame,\n\nTo save them from false Sextus\n\nThat wrought the deed of shame?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHaul down the bridge, Sir Consul,\n\nWith all the speed ye may;\n\nI, with two more to help me,\n\nWill hold the foe in play.\n\nIn yon strait path a thousand\n\nMay well be stopped by three.\n\nNow who will stand on either hand,\n\nAnd keep the bridge with me?\u201d\n\nThen out spake Spurius Lartius;\n\nA Ramnian proud was he:\n\n\u201cLo, I will stand at thy right hand,\n\nAnd keep the bridge with thee.\u201d\n\nAnd out spake strong Herminius;\n\nOf Titian blood was he:\n\n\u201cI will abide on thy left side,\n\nAnd keep the bridge with thee.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoratius,\u201d quoth the Consul,\n\n\u201cAs thou sayest, so let it be.\u201d\n\nAnd straight against that great array\n\nForth went the dauntless Three.\n\nFor Romans in Rome\u2019s quarrel\n\nSpared neither land nor gold,\n\nNor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,\n\nIn the brave days of old\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE, LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME by Thomas Babington Macauly, 1842)\n\nMacauly\u2019s prose is beautiful and instructive. It is very long and I have just quoted a tiny portion of it above.\n\nWe, as Nigerians, must read his words carefully, learn from brave Horatius, the greatest of all Romans, and be inspired and guided by his courage and strength.\n\nWe must be proud of who and what we are and we must be ready to stand for something, even at the cost of our lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome, who I love and respect, have said they have seen what is coming to our country and that we must have a plan B.\n\nI have seen what is coming to our country as well and I have been saying so for the last few months and years. However, for me, there is NO plan B.\n\nWe may evacuate our women and children but for those of us that are men, I say again there is and can be NO plan B.\n\nThere is no running. There is no surrender. There is no capitulation. There is no escape. We have no other country. We have nowhere to go and even if we did we choose not to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen and if the battle finally comes we stay here and either FIGHT and WIN or FIGHT and DIE. We are Nigerians! We are lions! We do not run from the battle. We do not buckle before the enemy. We are not cowards. We are warriors. We are fighters.\n\nWe are men and women of strength and faith. We do not flinch in the face of danger. We do not run for our lives when the enemy is at our gate. We go out and meet them head-on in glory and in power.\n\nBoko Haram or any other terrorist organisation will NEVER fly its flag over Abuja and neither will they ever take Lagos, Port Harcourt, Enugu, Kaduna, Jos, Ibadan, Sokoto, Awka, Maiduguri, or any of our other major cities.\n\nEvery Christian will fight them. Every Muslim will fight them. Every Southerner will fight them. Every Northerner will fight them. Every Middle Belter will fight them. Every Nigerian will fight them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey think they are dividing us but they are actually bringing us closer together. We are not Malians, Chadians, Nigeriens, Taurags, Berbers, or Arabs: we are NIGERIANS! And we will stand and fight for our motherland against these strange aliens and foreign invaders and their western backers.\n\nOur God is mighty and He will NEVER abandon us. We will fight to the last man to preserve our nation and deliver her from the hands of these foreign barbarians that have come from a distant land to destroy us all and take our women, children, treasure, and land.\n\nLike great Horatius, we must stand at the gate and hold the bridge. Like gallant Horatius, we must fight and win or we must fight and die!\n\nMay God have mercy on our nation and our people and may He cause us to fight a good fight!\n\nLet me conclude with this. Some are saying that the fight is and must be between ourselves and not between us and those foreigners from outside our shores that have invaded our land. How wrong they are.\n\nSome of us are planning on how to kill our brothers and compatriots whilst the stranger from a distant land that hates us all is hiding in the forests, mountains, and plains of our country and is preparing to slaughter us all to the last man, woman, and child. This is short-sighted and absurd.\n\nThere is no doubt that are major differences between us as a people which still need to be resolved. That battle still needs to be fought and that mountain still needs to be removed. I, more than anyone else, am aware of this and have spoken about these differences, injustices, and inequalities over the last five years.\n\nAnd be rest assured that that mountain will be removed, that valley will be levelled, that fight will be fought and that injustice will be set aside but NOT today.\n\nToday we MUST come together as one to face down and fight the foreign foe and their relentless sponsors in the international community who have come to wipe us all off the face of the earth, turn our nation into a cauldron of fire and turn our women and children into chattel and slaves.\n\nThey say they will use planes and chemical weapons to exterterminate us. They say they will bomb us from the air and crush us from the land and sea. They say they have all the wealth, weapons, power and strength that satan has given them and they are baying for our blood.\n\nThey may indeed have all that but they do NOT have Almighty God who is just and merciful and perfect in all His ways.\n\nThey do not have God the Great or the Living God who is mighty in battle and who cannot be resisted. They do not have the Ancient of Days or the Lord of Hosts who created and controls the universe.\n\nThey do not have the Elohim or the El Shaddai who forges the destiny of nations, who wields all power in heaven and on earth, and who rules in the affairs of men.\n\nThey do not have the Adonai or the Lion of the Tribe of Judah who created the sun, the moon, and stars and who established the firmament before the creation of time.\n\nThey do not have the Man of War or the God of Abraham, Isaac, David, and Jacob who is with us and who is our strong defender.\n\nIt is in His name and by His power that I rally and call on the sons of the East, the sons of the West, the sons of the Niger Delta, the sons of the Middle Belt, and the sons of the North to muster your strength, to stir up your courage, to steel your nerve, to stand firm on the ramparts and to come together as one in your power and glory to defend our land and our nation and to uproot and usurp the barbarians that are at our gate.\n\nThis is the challenge of our time and we shall meet it head-on. There is NO plan B! We stand and we fight and win or we stand and we fight and die!\n\nGlory, honor and praise be unto the name of our God who has given us this great opportunity and herculean task to defend the honor of our nation and our people and bring them to a safer place.\n\nWe will never make peace with a savage and barbaric alien breed that feeds fat on carnage and terror and that is committed to the mass murder, ethnic cleansing, and genocide of our people, and neither shall we bend the knee or bow, tremble and flee before them.\n\nVictory is ours because our cause is righteous, our people are noble, our warriors are strong and our God is faithful!",

          "title": "Looking back: Forty-five years ago",
          "text": "Forty-five years ago, as I turned 30, I left Lagos for Ibadan. From Ibadan, together with a comrade of the same age, I left for a rural community somewhere between Gbongan and Ile-Ife in present-day Osun state. There we joined others, similarly inspired like us, about ten in number, male and female, excluding two kids whom we took turns to \u201cbaby-sit\u201d in order to free the mother to participate fully in revolutionary duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe assembled to inaugurate an underground Marxist revolutionary vanguard embedded in the peasantry. While some members were fully in residence, others were semi-resident, but continually in touch with the headquarters. I was not only fully in residence, but disappeared to the outside world for between 9 and 12 months.\n\nThe strategic objective of that extraordinary expedition was to inaugurate an armed struggle in a socialist revolution which we recognised had been going on at a certain level in our country, Nigeria. The armed struggle did not happen. But it almost did. And in an attempt to force it to begin, we also almost ended up in self-liquidation.\n\nIt was when I was leaving the headquarters after the collapse of the expedition that our peasant comrades knew, through my contact address and full name, that not only was I not an Ijesha man, but that I was not even of Yoruba parentage. For I had integrated completely with them and had been one of their conscientisation discussion leaders in the Yoruba language for at least the preceding six months. The scene of separation was so emotional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe extraordinary expedition had profound effects on all the participants. But, as expected, the effects were of different kinds on different comrades, with some differences less significant than others. It was this variation in differences that made it possible for Biodun Jeyifo (BJ) and I, then Bene, to regroup almost immediately after the collapse of the expedition.\n\nPersonally, the effects of that Ode-Omu extraordinary expedition were completely transforming. I emerged from the commune a professional revolutionary: where to be a professional revolutionary was not conceived mechanically, for instance, in the way one is a professional teacher or a professional soldier, that is, in terms of training and occupation. It was not even conceived in the sense of making \u201crevolution\u201d the primary interest in one\u2019s life. Rather, to be a professional revolutionary was conceived in the sense of compelling every other interest or commitment \u2013 including nationality, sub-nationality, religion, family, friendship and engagements for material sustenance and reproduction to find accommodation and justification in the commitment to revolution.\n\nBut that is just one side of a professional revolutionary as conceived by me. The other side is the commitment to what Karl Marx, in his youthful days, called \u201ccategorical imperatives,\u201d that is, the \u201cstruggle to overcome all circumstances in which the human being is humiliated, enslaved, abandoned and despised.\u201d And later I added the commitment to struggle to extend immediate and unconditional solidarity to the \u201cwretched of the earth\u201d and ameliorate the human condition anywhere a professional revolutionary finds herself or himself. A professional revolutionary is thus a contradiction in the real world: simultaneous toughness and softness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe requirement sketched above is not a necessary one for every Leftist or even for every revolutionary. But it is a self-imposed requirement for every vanguard in the struggle against capitalism, capitalist social formations and imperialism. Some would say that for a sustainable revolution to take place there must be a substantial number of this category of revolutionaries. But I would modify this and say that at least the revolution should be capable of rapidly reproducing its own professionals as it proceeds.\n\nMy life as a professional revolutionary since the 1977 collapse of the extraordinary expedition has therefore been a contradictory one at least in the sense described in the preceding paragraphs. And it has been tough for that person who, in addition to having to share that life as a wife, a comrade and a lover, also has to live her life as an academic, an intellectual, a mother, a social activist, a Leftist-feminist and a revolutionary socialist. If there is any person who, since 1977, has kept me on my feet, stood with me as equal, pointing out what can be done today in anticipation of tomorrow, and correcting my frequent tactical and strategic errors, that person is Comrade Professor Bene Madunagu.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, on the eve of 2021 May Day, Comrade Bene and I made a re-affirmation and executed a long-standing decision of ours. The former was the re-affirmation of our subscription to Marxism, commitment to socialist revolution in Nigeria, and worldwide, and to revolutionary internationalism.\n\nAnd the latter was the decision to transfer our combined archives and libraries, built up since 1973, to the Nigerian Left. Following this definitive step, we established an 8-member board of advisors (BOA) to manage the combined archives and libraries on behalf and in the name of the Nigerian Left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis took effect on May 1, 2021. Any further announcement or action on this subject will be made or taken by the board.\n\nLet the struggle continue.\n\nMadunagu, mathematician and journalist, writes from Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria.",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "title": "Seerbit\u2019s Omoniyi Kolade wants financial inclusion for all Africans",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I learned two things about the man. He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

Whilst career aspirations may differ, there is a shared understanding that more women need to be involved in tech-related sectors, to meet the growing need for constant innovation across the world and addressing the topic of gender inclusiveness.\n\nWomen\u2019s month celebrated globally provides an opportunity to showcase female-focused initiatives to empower and drive growth for women. Amongst the several initiatives launched this year to celebrate International Women\u2019s day, Bolt introduced its Drive4WI Tech (Drive for Women In Tech) initiative to support women in building a career in technology. The initiative is an internship programme for young women who choose to start a career in technology regardless of their existing educational background.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, 9 interns were selected from Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. The goal for Bolt is to equip these interns, with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nThe interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests with three lucky Nigerians \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji, Miracle Nebo and Oluwakorede Oseni selected in the tightly contested programme.\n\nThe journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing talking point of discussion, largely influenced by cultural norms to societal expectations in relation to gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and is fulfilling its commitments to include more women in tech. The internship is a hands-on experience that gives the interns an opportunity to . The company has designed a curriculum to immerse its interns in their various departments and get the chance to work closely with highly skilled industry experts for the period.\n\nTech is key to development in Nigeria and Africa.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City, Nigeria\u2026Over 30 Nigerian Civil Society organisations have opposed the Archbishop of Canterbury support for Shell Carbon Energy Plan, and have requested the Archbishop to withdraw such support for a favourable Church of England position.\n\nIn a letter of 10th May 2021 signed by over 30 civil society organisations, convener of the groups, the Rev David Ugolor ANEEJ said that even though the organisation agree with the Archbishop that \u2018we all have moral and financial responsibility to address the climate emergency\u2019, they are \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 and \u2018concerned\u2019 that the Church of England\u2019s Pension Board is lending its moral and financial authority to Shell, and plans to vote for Shell\u2019s climate and energy plan at its 2021 Annual Meeting.\n\n\u2018Nigeria has deep experience with Shell, and as representatives of Nigerian citizens\u2019 groups we wish to tell you that we feel that the company is the opposite of accountable to most Nigerians, and has a track record of making misleading statements and commitments. Shell should not be rewarded for setting a long-term ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nWe need urgent action now, starting this year. It is not acceptable for the Church to sign off on a Shell plan for this decade that makes no absolute carbon emission reduction pledges, includes huge increases in gas production, and relies on improbably large amounts of tree-planting. Indeed, Shell\u2019s rush to find land for \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 might well lead to further carbon colonialism, slavery and human rights violations in the global south. Aiming for net-zero carbon emissions has become another effort by polluting entities like Shell to avoid cutting emissions but rather continue in the harmful practices that drive global warming.\n\nNet zero is not zero emissions. It simply means polluting and assuming the equivalent amount of carbon is absorbed by trees or is mechanically captured and stored by an assortment of risky and unregulated geo-engineering proposals. Endorsing Shell\u2019s plan is akin to handing the corporation a right to toy with planetary systems while the poor and vulnerable continue to fight a losing battle against global warming\u2019, the CSO letter to The Most Revd. Justin Welby read.\n\nThe groups said that they strongly disagree with the Church of England position that the Shell goal on Carbon Emissions is \u2018clear and unambiguous, and Shell is accountable for delivering that target\u201d.\n\nThe letter to Archbishop Justin Welby said that because the Church of England has an important voice in the world on many topics, it must take responsibility to lead engagement with the company on behalf of the Climate Action 100+, an initiative involving over 500 investors worth $54 trillion.\n\n\u2018With the effects of climate change more visible every year, the future of our children is at stake, in Nigeria, Africa and around the world. We hope that you hear our call, and take urgent steps to ensure that the church reconsiders its position on Shell. Endorsing the cynical climate plan offered by Shell would mean believing that Earth systems operate according to the principles of calculus and negates the truth that the Earth is a wonderfully created system of interdependent and complex systems that no man can control by mechanical contraptions or imaginations for the sole aim of meeting shareholder\u2019s pleasure. We urge you to use all the tools available to you to encourage all parts of the Church of England to challenge Shell, rather than champion the corporation\u2019s climate and energy plan.\n\nWe pray you to continue to support our demands for ecological justice and the protection of our environment and will be happy to continue the dialogue with you as we look forward to a positive response\u2019, the letter to Archbishop Welby stated.\n\nCivil Society organisations that signed the petition against the Church of England support for Shell Climate Reduction Plan include:\n\n1.

We would continue to work to improve security, which is local as no one can come to your neighborhood, places of worship without someone noticing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has its own responsibility. We can\u2019t wait for them; we must secure ourselves. We are using technology to secure Edo State. Security is local and it is only you that can secure yourself. The problem is that people are reluctant to say anything for fear of being accused, but we are reorganising and changing the narrative in Edo, as we are giving our people a voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building a Command and Control Centre where people can lodge reports and reach the government directly with information on what is going on across the state. We are buying drones, installing cameras and using technology to secure Edo people because the security of all Edo citizens is our prime responsibility,\u201d he noted.\n\nUrging Nigerians to refrain from stoking the embers of disunity and disaffection, the governor noted: \u201cThe biggest problem in Nigeria today is disaffection. The world is changing but people refuse to change but rather causing disaffection across the country pointing to the disunity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people that are not getting what they desire want Nigeria to fail. They are misguided and have failed, as Nigeria will remain united and will not disintegrate. We must not promote disaffection, but do things fairly. Once there is justice and fairness in the land, it will certainly reduce disaffection bringing in peace and harmony.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is a great country as God has given us a diverse country, diverse in everything, particularly its people. Everybody can\u2019t be the same or see things the same way or behave the same way. We have not come from the same tribe, but our beauty as a nation is in our diversity,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat we should do as Nigeria is to bring out the uniqueness in Nigerians that made us great. There is nothing wrong with diversity; it is important and beneficial. We should continue to emphasize unity in diversity as it makes us strong as a nation.\n\n\u201cWhen we complain about Nigeria not working, we are actually complaining about ourselves. But collectively, we can make the country great. We can\u2019t lay the blame of the nation solely on the footsteps of a few people. There may be failure in leadership; there is also failure in followership.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdulfattah Enabulele said, \u201cEdo remains one of the peaceful states in Nigeria and I urge us all to guard it jealously.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Inside First Bank Board Shake-up: How vested interests divide Nigeria\u2019s oldest lender",
          "text": "The battle for the control of Nigeria\u2019s oldest lender, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, among two power blocs dominated by key shareholders with interests in its ownership, was at the heart of the recent shake-up of the bank\u2019s board, PREMIUM TIMES has learnt.\n\nOne of the blocks is led by Nigeria\u2019s second richest man, Mike Adenuga, insiders said.\n\nOn April 29, the CBN dismissed the boards of the bank and its holding company, FBN Holdings, in a dramatic move that came a day after the bank appointed a new managing director. The regulator reinstated the former MD of the bank, Adesola Adeduntan.\n\nThe regulator said First Bank, which has over 31 million customers with a deposit base of N4.2 trillion, shareholders\u2019 funds of N618 billion, has for years been plagued by \u201cbad credit decisions, significant and non-performing insider loans and poor corporate governance practices\u201d.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES has learnt that a key reason for the crisis is the tussle for control of the bank between a block led by Oba Otudeko, who until a fortnight ago was the chairman of FBN Holdings\u2019 board, and Mr Adenuga, who recently emerged as one of the biggest shareholders in the bank.\n\nWhile Mr Otudeko had Ibukun Awosika, removed alongside him as chair of First Bank board, as his candidate, Mr Adeduntan, the reinstated chief executive, represented the interest of Arisekola Alao, a late Ibadan business mogul and prominent shareholder, on the board, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMr Adeduntan, 51, is viewed by the Otudeko block as now serving the interest of Mr Adenuga, who took over Mr Alao\u2019s significant shares after the latter\u2019s death in 2014.\n\nHe was appointed First Bank\u2019s managing director in 2016 to help the lender regain a sound financial footing after an avalanche of bad loans threatened to sweep it under.\n\nFirst Bank\u2019s bad loan charges had ballooned by almost four times from N25.942 billion to N119.322 billion between 2014 and 2015. That figure would soar further in the next twelve months, although at a slower pace this time, by 90 per cent to N226.037 billion, taking its delinquent loan to 24 per cent of its entire credit portfolio, well above the 5 per cent permitted by the central bank.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s intervention in the crisis, aimed at salvaging First Bank from a \u201cgrave financial condition\u201d, meant N150 billion was written off in bad loans after shareholders failed to recapitalise the bank amid capital adequacy concerns.\n\nProblematic Credit and Intrigues\n\nThe situation became problematic following a N75 billion loan facility by First Bank to Honeywell Flour Mills, in which Mr Otudeko owns majority stake. The insider lending, said to be beyond the single-obligor limit particularly for a director, called the bank\u2019s corporate governance to question.\n\nHoneywell Flour Mills said in a statement that the loan has performed from inception till date, and in accordance with agreed terms, the facilities were adequately secured with collaterals at over 170% of Forced Sales Value and 230% at Open Market Value.\n\nBut the CBN said the bank failed to perfect its lien on Mr Otudeko\u2019s shares in First Bank, which were placed as collateral for the loan. A lien ensures the creditor (First Bank in this case) obtains the right to the property (Mr Otudeko\u2019s shares) if the borrower (Honeywell Flour Mills) fails to meet its debt repayment obligations.\n\n\u201cWe further noted that after four years the bank is yet to perfect its lien on the shares of Mr. Oba Otudeko in FBN Holdco which collateralized the restructured credit facilities for Honeywell Flour Mills contrary to the conditions precedent for the restructuring of the company\u2019s credit facility,\u201d the CBN said.\n\nThe CBN has called in Honeywell Flour Mill\u2019s loan, and if the company is unable to pay up, Mr Otudeko may lose his shares in the bank.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Adenuga, who owns telco Globacom and holds majority stakes in Conoil, Sterling Bank, and Julius Berger Plc, has been stepping up efforts to buy the shares pledged as security for the loan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInsiders say Mr Adeduntan had demonstrated his willingness to oblige the CBN\u2019s demand to perfect the collateral, a decision that may likely favour Mr Adenuga and hand him majority control of the bank.\n\nMr Otudeko and allies currently hold 1.5 per cent of the bank\u2019s shares while Oye Hassan-Odukale holds 1.03 per cent, according to the bank\u2019s 2020 report. Mr Adenuga is said to be forging alliance with Mr Hassan-Odukale to oust Mr Otudeko as the bank\u2019s majority shareholder.\n\nWrite Off or Restructure\n\nMeanwhile, PREMIUM TIMES learned there had been plans by members of First Bank\u2019s top rank to either write off the N75 billion or restructure it to give the debtor some relief. The issue divided the lender\u2019s management into pro-Otudeko and anti-Otudeko groups.\n\nBut those backing the one-time chairman seemed to be stronger and had pushed for the removal of Mr Adeduntan, a source said.\n\nOn April 28, Mrs Awosika announced through a statement the retirement of Mr Adeduntan from the board and the appointment of Deputy Managing Director Gbenga Shobo as the new CEO. The statement also named a number of new directors who would join the board.\n\nBank officials told PREMIUM TIMES that Mr Otudeko had rejected a CBN earlier position that Mr Adeduntan should not be removed. The dismissal of the latter and the new appointments to the board was executed without the knowledge of the CBN, prompting the regulator to demand an explanation.\n\nIt promptly dissolved the boards of both FBN Holdings and First Bank, naming Remi Babalola and Tunde Odukola respectively as chairmen of the boards in a move it said it took to protect minority shareholders\u2019 and depositors\u2019 interests. The regulator went ahead to restore Mr Adeduntan, whom he has worked with since the 2016 crisis and whose retirement is actually due this December.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow a shareholder who feels he will not subject himself to regulatory control and authority to remain as a director of the bank,\u201d said CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele.",

CIPM, Chartered Institute of Personnel Managers of Nigeria, is the umbrella body for the country\u2019s human resource professionals.\n\nThe Bank picked up two coveted awards, the \u2018People First CEO Award\u2019 and the \u2018People First Health and Safety Award\u2019, at the high-profile recognition ceremonies regarded as the \u201cOscars\u201d of Nigeria\u2019s Human Resources industry.\n\nBoth awards celebrate Abubakar Suleiman, Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Bank and the leadership of the Bank\u2019s Human Capital function, for putting employees first following the outbreak of the pandemic last year by ensuring a strong focus on the physical and mental health, welfare, and safety of employees.\n\nCIPMN presented the awards in partnership with the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), the chartered body and leading global membership organisation for safety and health professionals. IOSH is a champion, supporter, adviser, advocate, and trainer of those who protect the safety, health, and wellbeing of others.\n\nCommenting on the awards, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) of Sterling Bank, Temi Dalley, said, \u201cNavigating an unprecedented and globally challenging crisis such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a defining moment for organisational leaders in 2020. We are favoured at Sterling to have an ingenious leader who operates with a remarkable balance of wisdom and empathy.\n\nOur CEO displayed an exemplary range in how he led Sterling through the abrupt and relentless changes that the pandemic heralded. He acted beyond the role of a Chief Executive Officer in this period and was our Chief Humanist Officer, Chief Protection Officer, and Chief Motivation Officer. He tasked himself with the overall wellbeing and continued productivity of over 4,000 employees that constitute the Sterling workforce through a difficult time, never navigated before.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dalley, in the immediate outbreak of the pandemic, Sterling Bank\u2019s first response was the \u201cgo home, stay home\u201d advisory to employees regardless of role or essentialism of function. Constantly, communication of the \u201cSafety before Service\u201d mandate set for all employees occurred through multiple channels, with leaders bringing its true meaning alive by example.\n\nThe Bank did not leave employees to deal with problems arising from the pandemic alone. Avenue was created to report perceived exposure or symptoms of COVID-19 to the Wellness Desk for advice on further actions, including isolation and testing at the Bank\u2019s designated centres with costs borne by the Bank.\n\nApart from tailoring its policies to protect pregnant employees, nursing parents, and those with underlying illnesses, the Bank also factored in the health, safety and wellbeing of their aged parents and relatives.\n\nSterling\u2019s response to the pandemic placed its people first and adequately created a balance between employee safety and continued optimum performance. Its mentally and physically healthy workforce, working either fully remote, shift, or on-site, is a testament to that. Additionally, the Bank\u2019s employee engagement trust index increased from 81% in 2019 to 87% in 2020 with no life and job loss due to the pandemic.",

He noted that his favourite subject was Mathematics and Basic Science but his parents were unable to fund his education.\n\nThe lockdown occasioned by Covid-19 pandemic hampered all educational institutions in Nigeria. During that time, every family in Nigeria was indoors.\n\nDavid\u2019s father, Towodey Sewey was busy in the farm, tending to his produce for his livelihood and feeding of his family depended on it. Since the lockdown, the promising child had been joining his father in the farm supporting him in the clearing, making of ridges as well as planting of tomatoes.\n\nWhile waiting for a fruitful harvest of their farm produce for three to six months, Towodey made a living out of clearing the bushes of other people\u2019s farm. This was not enough and It was somewhat difficult fending for David and his siblings.\n\nAfter the lockdown was lifted and schools gradually opened, there was no means to send David back to school for his father struggled to raise the little fund for his son. The meager fund available was just for the feeding of the family.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTowodey who expressed his frustrations, said his farming work had not been able to help him to support his family. \u201cHaving come from a family of farmers and learnt the trade, I was expecting it to be more rewarding in Nigeria when I relocated from Cotonou to Ogun State. Before the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, my child, David was in school and I tried to support him through school. Things got worse during the lockdown and my family tried to manage what we have.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy farming business took a downward turn after few months during the lockdown. I planted vegetables, chilli pepper, atarodo (scotch bonnet) and yams but did not get enough yields. Before the pandemic I clear bushes of other farms for five thousand naira per plot but now the farm work is not forth coming like before and I am not able to make enough money to send my son to school. He had started following me to the farm during the lockdown and now that school has resumed, it is difficult raising my son\u2019s school fees. I want him to go school to become somebody in life,\u201d says Towedey Sawey.\n\nMany peasants and low income people were affected during the lockdown occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the palliatives announced by the federal and state governments, many low income people like Towedey\u2019s did not receive.\n\nAside David\u2019s father, his friend, Mr Taweed Sewenu, who\u2019s also a farmer complained of the hardship experienced in the course of farming as they didn\u2019t make much income again.\n\nThe young lad, David, is determined to go back to school despite his increasing love for farming.\n\n\u201cI miss my classmates and teachers. I want people to help my father so that I can go back to school,\u201d he pleaded.\n\n* This report was facilitated by the Wole Soyinka centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ) under its free to share project.",

          "title": "BUSINESS 101: Cashew Nut Investment Opportunities",
          "text": "By Agbaji Chinedu |\n\nCashew (Anacardium occidentale) is an important industrial and export crop which potential is yet to be fully exploited in Nigeria. Cashew has for many years been used for food and income generation. The trees are usually grown for their kernels which when roasted have a very pleasant taste. Cashew is the common name for a tropical and sub-tropical evergreen tree, Anacardium occidentale L, in the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae.\n\nIt is also the name for the commercially important kidney-shaped, nut-like seed of this plant, which is edible when roasted or cooked (New World Encyclopaedia, 2008). The plant is a native of Tropical Central and South America, notably North Eastern Brazil, from where the Portuguese explorers introduced it into Nigeria in the 15th/16th Century.\n\nRaw nuts which are much in demand in industrialised countries are processed into kernels that constitute a valuable export product for confectionery. They are used as an ingredient for making fruit paste, candied fruit, canned fruit, cashew apple, resins, jams and jellies, chutney, fruit juice, alcohol and vinegar. Cashew kernels rank third after almonds and hazelnuts in the international trade of tree nuts. Wine and pulp are produced from cashew apple. Apple is eaten as a raw fruit or is fermented to produce a delicious alcoholic drink.\n\nThe pulp is the fibrous part obtained after extracting juice from the apple and could be used as animal feed or dried and processed into diet fiber biscuit. Another product of cashew is the Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL). It is greatly valued in the international market as a raw material for brake and clutch linings, paints, and vanishes. It is also used in lacques, agglutinants, insecticides and fungicides.\n\nNigeria is one of the top 10 raw cashew nut (RCN) producing countries in the , the third largest producers in Africa after Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Tanzania.\n\nProduction Statistics\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNigeria, having a total area of over 100,000 hectares of cashew plantation and an average annual production of 80,000 metric tonnes contributes almost 16 per cent of the total production of the agro-ecological zone. Its production is 5 per cent of the global situation. During the last three years, Nigeria has been one of the leading suppliers of raw cashew nuts exported to India. Nearly 18,000 to 23,000 metric tonnes of raw nuts per annum have been exported earning over N23 billion annually.\n\nProcessing Statistics\n\nAs abysmal as it may sound, Nigeria currently processes only about 10 per cent of the raw cashew nuts produced in the country. The rest of the nuts find their way to Asia and other countries where they are processed and exported back to Nigeria as finished and packaged cashew kernels.\n\nSourcing\n\nCashew is grown in 2/3 of the 36 states in Nigeria. However, the cashew nuts of export quality and quantity are mainly found in the Western and Eastern states of Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Ondo, Osun states, Anambra, Imo, Ebonyi, Enugu and Abia States respectively. The Nigerian cashew is also found to grow in the Middle Belt states of Nassarawa, Benue, Kogi and Kwara and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja\n\nUses\n\nThe shell of the cashew seed yields derivatives that can be used in many applications from lubricants to paints.\n\nIn confectionery and bakery products, for example, finely chopped kernels are used in the production of sweets, ice creams, cakes and chocolates, both at home and industrially and as paste to spread on bread.\n\nMarket For Nigerian Raw Cashew Nut\n\nThe major buyers of the Nigerian raw cashew nuts are India, Vietnam, Singapore, Dubai, and other European countries.\n\nRaw Cashew Nut Trading Season\n\nHarvest of mature cashew fruits takes place between February or early March till April. The entire harvest period occurs in approximately 16 weeks. RCN (raw cashew nuts) trading begins from March up till June (beyond June for stored RCN).\n\nHealth Benefits Of Cashew Nut\n\nCashews are rich in Vitamins C, E, K, phosphorous, iron, magnesium and zinc and also contain antioxidants, phytochemicals and protein. The kidney shaped nuts can be eaten on their own as a snack and they are often used in cooking. Adding cashews to your balanced diet can have many benefits and here are 10 of the health benefits of cashew nuts:\n\nIt reduces the risk of developing gallstones; improves the health of your heart; promotes healthy bones; helps to prevent cancer; improves the health of skin and hair; aids weight loss; improves the nerves in your body and assists the body in creating energy.\n\nInvestment Opportunities In Investing In Raw Cashew Nut\n\nProspective investors can profit from raw cashew nuts by making investments in the following value chain: Cashew plantation, raw cashew nuts trading; raw cashew nuts exports, raw cashew nuts processing, raw cashew nut storage and haulage",

Sadly, insecurity in the country is at an all-time high. Every region of the country is suffocating from insecurity. At present, in the South East and South-South, policemen and formations are endangered species as they are daily killed and attacked, raising fears of another Insurgency in the region.\n\nIn the North East, Boko Haram terrorists are still sacking villages and wreaking havoc. In the North West and North Central, bandits have made life a living hell for the people.\n\nThe question most Nigerians now ask is, how did we get here? How did life become so cheap in Nigeria? Daily newspapers are awash with gory tales of killings in almost every part of the country.\n\nMany Nigerians have suggested the creation of state police as a way out. Do I think it will solve the issue? It might.\n\nI also do not share the idea of regional security forces springing up in the regions. If the only way we will feel secured is retreating into our ethnic cocoons, then the country is heading for anarchy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe fears about state police are not far-fetched. Most Nigerians believe our governors will abuse the state police, which I also believe.\n\nFor example, the state electoral commissions and legislatures are in the pockets of the governors. In the states, you dare not question the policies of the governors. Most senators who have criticised their state governors lost their reelection bids.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how during a crisis, governors lament that they are not in control of the police but when it comes to rigging or arresting journalists and opposition figures in their states, they are in control of the police.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the way out? Insanity they say is doing the same thing all the time and expecting a different result. I think we should tinker a little with our police system. I also do not believe that funding the police will improve the performance of the force. If you give the whole defence budget to the police, they will still ask for the usual N20 bribe . It\u2019s already in their DNA.\n\nSadly, the police force as presently constituted cannot tackle insecurity in Nigeria. We need to tinker with the constitution to create state police. We should have a state police and a federal police which will serve as a check on the state police. We also need to strengthen and build our institutions that can check the excesses of some of our power-governors. This is the way to go.",

          "text": "Unlike other elective offices in the executive arm of government, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), gives lawmakers unlimited terms to serve. SUNDAY ISUWA and ADEBIYI ADEDAYO presents their profiles and participation in the lawmaking processes.\n\nIn the Senate, despite competitions to occupy elective offices in Nigeria, 11 senators have made it to the red chamber for three consecutive times and more. While in the House of Representatives, five lawmakers have also joined the rank. This feat qualifies them to be addressed as high ranking lawmakers.\n\nAhmad Lawan\n\nSenator Lawan, the Senate president is one of the most experienced lawmakers in the National Assembly. He came to the National Assembly in 1999, as a member of the House of Representatives on the platform of the defunct All Peoples Party (APP) which transformed into the former All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and later merged with other parties to form the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014.\n\nBorn on 12th January, 1959, the 62-year-old lawmaker served in the House of Representatives before moving to the red chamber. In the 8th Senate, he was majority leader towards the end of the session.\n\nBefore the inauguration of the 9th Senate, the leadership of his party anointed him to be Senate president but lost to former Senate President Bukola Saraki in a political drama where the PDP outwitted the APC.\n\nThe lecturer-turned politician has a PhD in Remote Sensing. He has great knowledge of the workings of the legislature. He was among the lawmakers that rejected the third term for former President Ousegun Olusegun Obasanjo. He was also among the lawmakers who passed the \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d to make former then Vice President Goodluck Jonathan acting president when the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua fell sick.

He has chaired the House Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and at various times served in Committees on Banking and Currency, Niger Delta, Governmental Affairs, Sports, and Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nDespite his wealth of experience as a lawmaker, Mutu is not known to be one of the vocal voices on the floor of the House. However, this is not enough to conclude that his legislative interest has suffered; his strategy has been to operate at the committee level to secure the interest of his people.\n\nIn 2016, Mutu sponsored the NDDC Amendment Act which empowers the minister of Niger Delta Affairs to make regulations for the effective discharge of the commission.\n\nFemi Hakeem Gbajabiamila\n\nHon Olufemi Hakeen Gbajabiamila is the incumbent speaker of the House of representatives.

The lawmaker has been representing Isoko North/Isoko South Federal Constituency of Delta State since 2003.\n\nOgor was the minority leader of the House in the 8th Assembly and served as deputy house leader in the 7th Assembly.\n\nHe also served as chairman of several Ad-hoc Committees of the House including the Pentascope Investigative Panel, Malabu Oil Block Sale, Single Windows System, BOFIA Amendment Act Committee, Ad-hoc Committee on the Poor Services of GSM service providers in the country, Chairman Ad-hoc Committee on Rice Import Quota and Duty Payments and many others.\n\nOgor has sponsored 16 bills, including the bill for an Act to amend the Nigerian LNG (Fiscal incentive, Guarantees and Assurances) to make its statutory contribution to the NDDC Fund and for other matters connected therewith.\n\nHis 2016 bill on immunity clause for presiding officers of the National Assembly remains one of the most controversial in the history of Nigeria\u2019s legislature.\n\nUmar Yakubu Barde\n\nHon Barde has been representing Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency of Kaduna State since 2003 and was the minority whip in the 8th Assembly.

In the 6th Assembly, he was deputy chairman of the House Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and in the 7th Assembly, he served as the chairman, House Committee on MDGs.\n\nAlthough Doguwa almost lost out in the 2019 election when the Court of Appeal in Kaduna nullified his election and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a re-run within 90 days. Eventually, he won and the position of House majority leader was preserved until his return.\n\nWhile Doguwa cannot be remembered for any sound legislative contribution on the floor of the House, He is no doubt a core political strategist and a stabilising factor in the House.",

          "text": "*Begs Nigerians to show more understanding on insecurity\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has assured that his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.\n\nThe President, according to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made the call in a chat with State House correspondents shortly after observing the Eid-il-Fitr prayers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast, on Thursday.\n\nAccording to him, the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\nThe President, who hoped for a good rainy season this year, said \u201cthe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land.\n\n\u201cThis is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for its support, saying that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well.\n\nWithin the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nHe, however, appealed to the nation\u2019s elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military.\n\nIf we order for weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field.\n\nThis is a very long process,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe President also appealed to Nigerians to show more understanding on the current security situation in the country.\n\nHe also urged the Nigerian elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\nBuhari has been under increasing pressure from Nigerians to find a lasting solution to the country\u2019s worst security challenges since independence.\n\nHe said: \u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we came in, in the North-East, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security.\n\n\u201cWithout security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the North West and we are dealing with it.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturer.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari assured Nigerians that his administration would use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits and other criminals wreaking havoc in many parts of the country.",

          "text": "*Woos Urhobo union to intervene\n\nBy Nosa Akenzua, Asaba\n\nThe Federal Government has written to the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) to beg former Delta State Governor, Chief James Ibori to withdraw his suit against the United Kingdom on the planned repatriation of about \u00a34.2 million linked to him.\n\nThe government also said that should the UPU intervene in the matter, it would create an enabling environment for the consideration of the appeal by the union that the looted asset be used to implement projects in Delta state.\n\nRecall that the UPU, under the leadership of Engineer Joseph Omene, had asked the Nigerian Government to use the said loot to implement projects in the state when it is repatriated.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Omene, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, noted that the suit filed by Chief Ibori against the United Kingdom on the confiscated assets has become a stumbling block for repatriation.\n\nThe AGF letter with the title, \u201cRe-Commendation for Retrieval of Delta\u2019s Stolen Funds and request for Review of Projects to be Executed with the Retrieved Funds\u201d, was signed by Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu, the Special Assistant to the President on Justice Reform and International Relations.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI am directed to inform (you) that the HAGF is in receipt of your letter dated 23rd March 2021 with regard to the above subject matter.\n\nThe HAGF appreciates your concerns and welcomes the interest of UPU in the returned assets.\n\n\u201cThe HAGF wishes to inform that he does not have the authority to approve projects for the application of returned assets.\n\nThese decisions are taken at the Federal Executive Council after in-depth deliberations. The HAGF\u2019s mandate is to implement the decisions of the council.\n\n\u201cI am also directed to inform further that the decision of the council is also guided by bilateral negotiations between Nigeria and the country from which the asset will be returned.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Nigeria and the government of the United Kingdom or any other country for that matter must agree on a specific project in a transparent and accountable manner before a project is approved.\n\n\u201cHowever, the HAGF has directed that I inform you that the stumbling block in negotiating the return of assets linked to Ibori to Nigeria is the ongoing litigation by Mr James Ibori against the government of United Kingdom in the confiscation hearing in London.\n\n\u201cIt is advisable that you approach Mr James Ibori to advise him to withdraw his appeals against the confiscation and repatriation of the assets linked to him, his family, and associates back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is the only way to provide an enabling environment for negotiation of the use of the identified assets for Delta State.\u201d\n\nSources say the Urhobos have been very angry with the way the Attorney General of the Federation have been handling the issue, adding that \u201cWe will do everything possible for us to have the money returned to Delta State Government and be Judiciously used for the development of the State.\u201d\n\nBut Olorogun David Oghenefejiro who spoke to our correspondent said \u201cWhy is it that Deltans are interested in the stolen by Chief Ibori.\n\nThe money as far as I am concerned should not be released to Delta State Government, otherwise the state government will steal the money.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Ehiedu Aniagwu said \u201cWe are very much interested in the return of the money not for squander but to be used for the provision of more infrastructural development in Delta State.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has no reason not release the money to us because a lot has been said. Malami writing Urhobos in any way will not offer any solution rather than to ensure that the money is release to the State.\n\nOkowa has done a lot to Justify good governance and if there anybody else saying that the money should not be released, it means the person or persons are enemies of developments\u201d",

I feel obliged to devote much attention to the study of our Yoruba nation\u2019s vicissitudes in these terrible times and from such studies, I am hereby raising an informed alarm to the governors of our states.\n\n\u201cI humbly and passionately urge our governors to come together to give the needed response to the danger that threatens to engulf Yorubaland in, most probably, the next few days.\n\n\u201cIt is very well known that the signature action of these foreign terrorist organizations is to first destroy prominent assets of the society that they attack.\n\nThat could mean that major public and private buildings in Lagos and Ibadan, particularly the hugely symbolic Cocoa House in Ibadan, would be their immediate targets.\n\n\u201cOwners and custodians of significant edifices in Yorubaland are strongly advised to establish formidable security for their edifices.\n\nThese include bridges, important public and private buildings, churches and such eminent church estates as the Redeemed, Winners, Deeper Life, Mountain of Fire Church camps and the unique Synagogue building of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, and even our most prestigious central mosque buildings in Lagos, Ibadan and our other cities.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria under Buhari will triumph like Manchester City \u2013 Adesina",
          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nPresidential spokesman, Femi Adesina has likened Nigeria\u2019s situation to that of Manchester City that rose from grass to win the English Premier League, saying peace and security will be restored to Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAdesina, in his article, titled:: \u201cLesson for Nigeria from EPL,\u201d said eight weeks into the season, many City fans were angry with the club over poor performance and had given up hope that the club would win the EPL.\n\nHe said forces which he called \u2018Aiye\u2019 were against City to bring it down, saying that the forces were already rejoicing until Manchester City bounced back to reckoning.\n\n\u201cEight weeks into this season that ends in another two weeks, Man City (as the team is popularly called) was Number 13 on the EPL table, which consists of 20 teams. And 38 games were to be played to complete the cycle.\n\n\u201cFans of the team were already hissing and cursing. Their opponents were gyrating and doing a jig, saying Man City was doomed for another season.\n\n\u201cRecall what happened in the 2019/2020 season. Man City was eyeing a treble. Three back-to-back seasons as champions, and a record in English football. But the adversaries knew the record that was to be set, so they arrayed themselves against the team.\n\n\u201cJust as some forces knew the record that was to be achieved by Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerian President, and which he had begun to show since 2015 when he got into office, and they positioned against the government,\u201d he said.\n\nAdesina added: \u201cEvery team, big or small, strong or weak, set its sights on Man City last season, flexed muscles, summoned superhuman skills and strength whenever they were meeting the champions attempting a treble. The end result? Man City finished a distant second behind Liverpool, which had emerged like a thundering typhoon, to win the laurel in admirable fashion.\n\n\u201cThe lesson? When you are high-flying, the centrifugal forces will come against you, and it would only take the grace of God for you to attain. Yoruba people call those forces Aiye. When Aiye is on your case, as it was against Man City, and it is against the Buhari government, you need God, and God alone. Aiye (meaning \u2018the world,\u2019 if freely translated) is the negative part of mankind. The pernicious, baleful, sly and scheming part of humanity. If Aiye gets on your matter, you need God and God alone.\n\n\u201cMan City failed to make record last season. Because Aiye was there. Liverpool shot out like a bolt from the blues, and won the league for the first time after 30 years. It won new adherents to itself from different parts of the world. Buhari Amazon, Jewel Ifunaya Chika, was one of them. She simply ported from Manchester United, which she had been supporting for years, and pitched her tent with Liverpool. More about that team later.\n\n\u201cMan City failed to make record in 2019/2020 season. Aiye was in full force against it. And the 2020/2021 season was initially not looking promising either. Eight weeks gone, the team was placed 13th on the table. It had lost 2-5 to Leicester City at home in Etihad Stadium, Tottenham drubbed it by two goals, played draw with teams that couldn\u2019t hold a candle to it in the past, and was generally forlorn and limp. Aiye was having a ball, laughing Man City to scorn.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t they doing the same thing against the government in our country today, due to unrelenting security challenges, some of them possibly instigated by Aiye themselves?\u201d\n\nAdesina said in November, 2020, the table turned for good for Man. City, just as it would inexorably turn for Nigeria soon.\n\n\u201cThe team beat Burnley by five goals to nothing, and it was the beginning of the turnaround. Victory came after victory, to the extent that the team was unbeaten in 21 consecutive games in the different competitions it was involved in. From the ashes, the Salamander had risen. Fire could not consume it, and today, Man City are champions, fifth time in 10 years.\n\n\u201cWho says Nigeria will not rise from its current travails? Who says Aiye will always win? Not where God is involved. And God is involved with Nigeria, our own dear native land. Under President Buhari, peace and security would be restored. The economy would rebound.\n\n\u201cLife would be abundant for the people , and Aiye would be left standing small, holding the rump of the flag of a country it thought had gone into oblivion. The winner takes it all, the loser standing small (apologies ABBA).\n\n\u201cIt was not glory ride for Man City all the way, however. It lost other crucial matches to Man U, newcomer Leeds United, and Chelsea. But did that alter the destiny for the season? No! Nigeria will also attain her destiny, and soon too. Amen, somebody,\u201d he said.\n\nStill on the EPL, Adesina also drew a vital lessons too from Liverpool, the darling of the last two seasons.\n\n\u201cIt first won the European Champions League, and then the Premiership. The team was simply radiating, making conquests and winning new followers. Till Aiye stepped into her case.\n\nLiverpool, which won the league last season by a wide margin, has been struggling in a pitiable way this season. It is exerting itself so strenuously, not for number one or two positions, but to end in number four, and book a place in the Champions League. What happened?\n\n\u201cAiye went after the team, the way it did to Man City when the team was to set a record. This season, Liverpool has lost not less than eight games, most of them at its Anfield home, back to back. And to comparatively lowly teams. It was humiliated by Fulham (now gone into relegation), Brighton, Burnley, Southampton, and other minnows.\n\n\u201cNot to be forgotten is the 7-2 shellacking last October by Aston Villa, and the 4-1 pounding by Man City in February. Thy glory oh Liverpool is slain upon the high places. How are the mighty fallen! Just because of Aiye.\n\n\u201cLiverpool crashed out of the Champions League, losing to Real Madrid, which Chelsea came to beat home and away. On the day it was poised to change position on the league table, making a 4th placement sure, it was leading Newcastle till the very last minute of the game, when it suddenly crumbled.\n\n\u201cThe opponents drew level in the 95th minute, the very last seconds of added time. Aiye in action. Man City bounced back from the ashes to emerge victors. It has won the Carabao Cup this season, and may win the Champions League on May 29, if her luck holds,\u201d he added.\n\nAdesina is optimistic that Liverpool would be back someday soon, as Nigeria would confound the enemies, and that it would happen under Buhari\u2019s leadership.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Good Book has said it, in Micah 7:8: \u201cRejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall rise again.\u201d Man City rose. Liverpool will rise. Nigeria will rise. And Aiye would lose. And fall flat on its face. I can hear the Amen.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday pledged said his administration is working hard to tackle insecurity confronting the nation and he hopes Nigerians understand.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the State House shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast, President Buhari said that the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Watching Israel-Palestine Conflict With \u2018Great Concern\u2019 \u2013 Foreign Ministry\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against the bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHe said his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.\n\n\u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources. For example, when we came in, in the Northeast, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest and we are dealing with it,\u201d said the President.\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, President Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\nHe also commended the National Assembly for its support, saying that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari then made an appeal to the nation\u2019s elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers. It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, the Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members, and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.",

          "text": "Liverpool\u2019s top-four hopes are still alive after Roberto Firmino\u2019s brace helped them to a 4-2 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Thursday night.\n\nThe rescheduled match from May 2 once again saw protests outside of Old Trafford against the Glazer family that owns Man United, but the game was able to be played with both teams arriving safely at the stadium.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s first victory at Old Trafford in seven years left them knowing that winning their last three games will give them a great chance of breaking into the top four at the end of a disappointing season.\n\n\u201cGreat fight, good game, intense, and the first win at Old Trafford since I am here,\u201d said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. \u201cGood timing, I would say. We fought hard for it, we deserved it\u201d.\n\nBruno Fernandes put the home side in front on 10 minutes, dispatching from an Aaron Wan-Bissaka pass that deflected into the goal to put further pressure on a Liverpool team chasing the remaining Champions League places.\n\nHowever, Diogo Jota\u2019s clever flick from a Nathaniel Phillips half-shot beat Dean Henderson in the United goal to draw Klopp\u2019s side level in the 34th minute.\n\nLiverpool then took the lead just before half-time on the back of a Firmino bullet header from a set piece that saw the hosts go into the dressing room trailing 2-1.\n\nThings got worse for United as the second half started, a pair of bad giveaways led to Henderson spilling the rebound from a Trent Alexander-Arnold shot into Firmino\u2019s path for the Brazilian\u2019s second goal of the match.\n\nLiverpool dominated Man United after hitting their third, but it was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team that scored next, with Marcus Rashford beating Alisson to trim the deficit to one.\n\nUnited pushed for an equaliser, but Mohamed Salah put the game to bed just before full-time, calmly slotting past Henderson after a long run down the right flank to seal the points.\n\nThe result puts Liverpool on 60 points from 35 games and in fifth place, four behind Chelsea in fourth, but with a game in hand. Man United are still in second on 70 points and look set to stay in the top four with two matches remaining.\n\nThird-placed Leicester face Chelsea next Tuesday, which could provide an opening for Liverpool.\n\n\u201cWe are still in the race, that\u2019s all we could have done tonight,\u201d said Klopp.",
