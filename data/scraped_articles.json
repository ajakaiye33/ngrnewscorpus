          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday, lamented that some individuals are \u201cmercilessly\u201d against Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President spoke during the 6th regular meeting with the Presidential Economic Advisory Council led by Prof Doyin Salami at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAdesina, in the statement titled \u2018We\u2019ll develop our irrigation facilities more, President Buhari assures,\u2019 said the PEAC noted that security challenges were having great repercussions on the economy.\n\nHe said the President then charged leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noting that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nHe further quoted Buhari as decrying the situation in which some unscrupulous people tried to undermine every policy of the government, irrespective of the good it was meant to achieve for the country.\n\nHe quoted the President as saying that, \u201cSome people are mercilessly against this country.\n\n\u201cWe closed the borders to control the smuggling of petroleum products, and check the influx of smuggled goods, arms and ammunition. That was when the Comptroller General of Customs called me, saying 40 tankers laden with petrol had been impounded. I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles. I said shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped. People must show consideration for their own country.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesman also quoted Buhari as promising that the Federal Government will focus on the greater development of irrigation facilities in the country and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome economic challenges confronting it, stressing that \u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources; Gas, vast arable land, which we are not using enough.\u201d\n\nThe President was said to be responding to Salami\u2019s disclosure, in his presentation, that only two per cent of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives are needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nAccording to the statement, PEAC submitted that the global economy has continued to improve as COVID-19 infections drop and roll-out of vaccination intensifies, adding that the Nigerian economy, though out of recession, remains fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill as a basis for revitalizing the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation, and incentives for private investment in irrigation, to promote all-year-round farming.",

Mbaka and their target is the assets belonging to the Adoration Ministry. They already have the blessings of two Southeast governors to make sure that Mbaka is chased out of circulation.\n\n\u201cIt is also sad that Bishop Onaga and the Catholic Nuncio to Nigeria and some vicars are part of this selfish game. Where were they all the while that Fr. Mbaka had been releasing a series of prophecies? How come they are so peesed off this time if not that they are under certain influence? How come that Bishop Kukah who has said more things about the current Government has not been punished?\n\n\u201cWe have no doubt in our mind that the church authority is dancing to a music being played by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBut we warn that enough is enough. Every form of punishment or ban on Mbaka should be lifted forthwith.

Please don\u2019t be offended Aunty Iyabo, it is because I know how pained you are over the matter. The secret about Aunty Iyabo\u2019s rape is also known to Baba Ijesha and it is a top secret and this why Aunty Iyabo feel offended.\n\n\u201cPrincess and Baba Ijesha have very intimate relationship for many who don\u2019t know.

CCTV does not pick voice but this particular camera picked their voice conversation.\n\n\u201cYou will see in that video that the girl was the one who made the first move towards Baba Ijesha, then he made advances too and embraced her.\u201d\n\nSir Koro further questioned why the girl was stationed to sit in the same spot even when she left to get something, adding it was a planned set-up.\n\nHe made a strong allegation that Princess had aborted a baby for the girl and that was what brought the matter to fore.\n\nHe however urged the government to arrest Princess, the girl and the two men who were involved in the setting up, before passing its final verdict on Baba Ijesha.",

The alleged movement of the bandits caused a stir in the FCT forcing many schools in Bwari to be hurriedly shutdown, with messages sent to parents to pick up their wards from hostels in the area.\n\nA private university owned by the Catholic Church, Veritas, and a polytechnic located close to Bwari have all shutdown and students ordered to go home.\n\nActing Secretary of Education for the FCT, Leramoh Abdulrazaq, assured that security measures have been put in place to ensure the safety of schools.\n\n\u201cThe police, Department of State Security, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, air force, and even the army, as we speak, are in schools that are in session to ensure adequate security,\u201d he said.\n\nBut residents of the attack prone communities appear not to take Abdulrazaq assurances seriously as it was learnt that some parents in the area have refused to send their children to school, pending when security situation would improve.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that residents are taking extra steps to boost their personal security.

          "text": "Obinna Chima with agency report\n\nTwo Nigerian lenders \u2013 Zenith Bank Plc and Access Bank Plc \u2013 are among the list of financial institutions from Africa and the Middle East that have indicated an interest in the acquisition of Union Bank Plc and other African assets of Atlas Mara Group, a Pan-African banking group.\n\nBloomberg which disclosed this quoted sources familiar with the matter to have disclosed that Atlas Mara Limited, the London Stock Exchange-listed pan-African banking group started by Mr. Bob Diamond has received a number of approaches for its 49.97 per cent holding in Lagos-based Union Bank of Nigeria.\n\nZenith Bank Plc and Access Bank Plc are among the suitors that have expressed interest alongside other African rivals such as Morocco\u2019s Attijariwafa Bank, the sources said.\n\nTHISDAY also confirmed the development from sources in the two tier-1 banks, who also pleaded to remain anonymous.\n\nMiddle Eastern banks and private equity suitors have also shown interest, according to the sources. Some potential buyers have indicated that they may acquire all of Atlas Mara\u2019s remaining assets in Africa, which would include its Zimbabwe unit, they said.\n\nAtlas Mara has been working with Rothschild & Co. to consider options for its Union Bank stake. No final decisions have been made, and there\u2019s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for Atlas Mara and Zenith Bank didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attijariwafa Bank Managing Director Ismail Douiri and a representative for Access Bank declined to comment.\n\nA deal could bring down the curtain on Atlas Mara\u2019s African foray after Diamond, a former Barclays Plc chief executive officer, misjudged competition on the continent and overpaid for acquisitions. The company said recently that it\u2019s secured regulatory approval for the sales of its businesses in Botswana and Mozambique and received interest in other assets, without elaborating.\n\nAtlas Mara also said it completed a planned restructuring process and extended a standstill agreement with its creditors to May 17 to complete the necessary documentation. It\u2019s still in legal disputes with two creditors, TLG and Norsad, it added.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the need to reposition the company, which has seen a plunge of about 96% in its stock since it started trading toward the end of 2013. The firm\u2019s stake in UBN, Nigeria\u2019s sixth-biggest bank by market value is its largest investment and seen as a foothold into the continent\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Frontier and Sub-saharan Africa Banks\u2019 Analyst, Renaissance Capital, Adesoji Solanke, wrote in a note made available to THISDAY yesterday: \u201cGood for Atlas Mara if they\u2019re able to exit successfully, as they\u2019ve been selling a bunch of assets over the past year, to KCB and Access Bank respectively across different markets. Whether they get a good valuation for Union Bank is another thing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a transformational deal for Access or Zenith (Return-on-Equity dilutive for both), but could be a good way for the Middle Eastern banks to get a decent foothold in the market. We suspect getting the other private equity investor block to sell will be critical as we wouldn\u2019t expect a strategic bank investor to desire a minority shareholding.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist on implementation of full financial autonomy for judiciary, legislature\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThere seems to be no end in sight for the industrial action by the judiciary and legislative workers pressing for the full implementation of financial autonomy for the two arms of government in states as they have vowed not to compromise on their demands for the implementation of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThe workers, who have been on strike for about one month, said yesterday at a meeting with a federal government team, led by Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that the issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries was the constitutional provision that did not warrant any negotiation with governors.\n\nThe national leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) also insisted that the governors must fully implement financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation as guaranteed by the constitution before the current strike will be called off.\n\nBut the federal government pleaded with the unions to consider the efforts being made to resolve the dispute and suspend their strike to enable courts and legislative houses to reopen.\n\nNgige said yesterday in Abuja that progress had been made on about 90 per cent of the issues in dispute.\n\nHowever, the meeting between the federal government team and the leadership of the unions ended last night with an agreement that the unions should go and study the government\u2019s proposal, while the meeting reconvenes next week.\n\nBut earlier, during the opening of talks with the federal government team and representatives of the governors, the Deputy Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Emmanuel Abioye, said the unions still maintained their stance on the full implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislative arms of government in the states.\n\nAbioye, while responding to the minister\u2019s address, said: \u201cI am happy that when you were talking, you said it is a constitutional issue and so since it is a constitutional issue, I don\u2019t think we should negotiate on it. We are trying to avoid someone somewhere coming to challenge the constitution one day. So, anything short of this is not why we are here.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of PASAN, Mr. Mohammed Usman, said the meeting availed them the opportunity to receive the fresh proposals by the governors, adding that the unions resolved to present the proposals to their national executive committees.\n\nHe stated that the unions would be reporting their decisions to the government at another meeting next Tuesday, adding that the strike will continue.\n\nAccording to him, the governors only agreed to shift ground on the issue of ceding money for capital projects to the two arms of government.\n\n\u201cAside from the ceding of capital projects, there is nothing new in the governors\u2019 position. However, we are happy that the federal government has opened negotiations on the matter but we will not suspend the strike until there is agreement on the implementation of full autonomy,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige, however, asked the workers to suspend the strike.\n\nWhile welcoming the parties to the resumed negotiations, the minister said about 90 per cent progress had been achieved in harmonising issues with the governors.\n\nNgige expressed optimism that the strike would soon end.\n\nHe said the government side had made offers to the two unions for them to consult with their various National Executive Committees and revert back.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of work went into the proposal given by the government side to the two unions, which substantially addressed their demands for judicial and legislative autonomy in the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe minister stated that the proposal was produced by the committee of the government side, comprising the Solicitor-General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. Dayo Apata (SAN); the Secretary of the Presidential Committee for the Implementation of Judicial and Legislative Autonomy, Senator Ita Enang; representative of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the Director-General of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF).\n\nNgige said: \u201cA lot of work went in. We have exchanged briefs with the JUSUN and PASAN. They have their demands, which they had earlier submitted. The government side has given counter offers and properly addressed the burning issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe stated that questions were asked and answered, while observations were made and explained, working on the proposal given by the government side.\n\nNgige said the meeting had been adjourned with a view to enable JUSUN and PASAN to take back the government proposal to their members for consideration.\n\n\u201cWe expect them to work on the documents from tomorrow and if they are satisfied, they should inform us. And you know that when they are satisfied, the logical thing is to call off the industrial dispute. So, we are to receive their views on the government offer by Tuesday morning,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige said the discussions were fruitful, adding that they have moved from the initial position of ground zero, to ground 85.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the striking workers to return to work to enable the government to meet the remaining part of their demands.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this when the legislatures are closed in various states. We cannot also operationalise them when the courts are closed and heads of courts are not allowed into the courts or their offices.\n\n\u201cWe have made documentation and statistics for the state Houses of Assembly to make appropriate laws. So, we plead that you open the courts and state Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cBesides, we are menaced by bandits, terrorists and arsonists. With the courts closed, the police cannot tackle insecurity,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Eta Enang, who also spoke at the opening talks with representatives of JUSUN and PASAN, said the suspension of the strike had become necessary to enable the legislatures to pass legislation needed to ensure the smooth implementation of the financial autonomy.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to JUSUN and PASAN that we did not undertake all these efforts in vain and that when we arrive at a certain decision at the end of the technical session, you will be able to hit the ground running. We plead that you call off the strike because we will not be able to pass the necessary laws if the legislative houses remain closed,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, from the engagement so far with the governors, he believed that the gap was being closed.\n\nEnang stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had told the governors to do what was right to the judiciaries and legislatures in their states just as was being done at the federal level.\n\n\u201cThe president is saying to the governors, go and treat the state legislature and judiciary arms the same way we treat the National Assembly and the judiciary at the federal level,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the outcome of the meeting, Abioye said they were going back to meet with their National Executive Committees to study the situation and consider the offers made before reverting back to Ngige.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: NIN Registration Essential for Winning War against Insecurity",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday described National Identification Number (NIN) registration by Nigerians as key to win the ongoing war against insecurity.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Nigerians to fully participate in the ongoing synchronisation of NIN with SIM cards as it will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy.\n\nThe president, at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration at the State House, Abuja said proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database would provide the impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\nHe assured the nation that his administration is fully committed to the safety of Nigerians, adding that linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid national planning and budget preparations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was timely as it would support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies align with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security and anti-corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe digital economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 per cent double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 per cent. This is truly commendable.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the digital economy sector provided online options for activities hitherto restricted to offline channels, while minimising the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors, and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe also said the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe federal government embraced institutionalising online meetings through the approval of the national policy on virtual engagements in federal public institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce, is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the president added.\n\nBuhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past.\n\n\u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Pantami had appreciated the president for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nAccording to him, NIN Registration has recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, with over 12 million of them enrolled within six months.\n\nHe said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that could be used in various transactions, adding that the NIN and SIM card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 per cent of the target audience.\n\nPantami stated that the buoyancy of the telecoms sector has given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world class SIM card manufacturing company sited in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The story of Anna, the Egbado little girl, and our lack of progress as a people",
          "text": "Great stories are made when misfortunes spin a fortunate turn. We relish a tragic plot that fails to deliver a sad ending. So, the grass to grace story of raggedy start and happy end tickles the soul. We love it when a dwarf falls a giant. That is why David and Goliath and their battle in the valley at Ella resonate. The story of the little man in defiance of gravity rekindles hope for miraculous; it reassures that we too can spring great surprises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRarely does fate turn tragedies around as it did in the case of Anna, the seven-year-old girl from Egbado area, captured in a raid by King Ghezo in 1848. Anna lost all her family members in the raid and was whisked to Dahomey by the slaver-king with other captives. The young girl had thought she would be sold into a far-flung land, it was unknown to her as she contemplated her fate that the king had a different plan; a morbid plot, to keep her aside, later to be offered as a sacrifice to his gods. Anna was still at the ledge of the horrid fate when Captain Fredrick E. Forbes landed at the Whydah port in 1850, two years into her captivity.\n\nThe Captain was in Dahomey as an emissary of Queen Victoria to make the slaver-king see it was time to end the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade, that Britain had abetted for more than three centuries. Forbes would later recount that he was driven by the intelligence of the little girl slated for the gods to ask the King to allow him to take her to England as a gift to Queen Victoria, and King Ghezo mercifully consented.\n\nForbes gave Anna a new name, Sarah Forbes Bonetta, after himself and the ship that sailed them out of Whydah port in 1850. He presented the girl to Queen Victoria as he landed, and the monarch took a liking to the maiden the moment she set eyes on her. She affectionately named her Sally and brought her in to live at Windsor Castle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike a piece from a fantastic tale, the one who was pledged to the gods by the Dahomey king became the ward of the palace in England. Queen Victoria later describe her as \u201csharp and intelligent\u201d, the superlatives rarely used on blacks by whites those days, in the deeply racial English society. Anna also enrolled in school under a royal sponsorship when formal schooling was still a rarity here in the continent of her birth. The ward of the Queen was married to James Labulo Davis, a Yoruba compatriot in England as she turned 19 in 1862.\n\nThough it sounds like a tapestry for fables, the story of Anna and her rendezvous with fate is a rarity in history. It was unusual for a slave pledged to the gods to end up getting a reprieve from a mindless fellow like King Ghezo. It was not also commonplace for the Queen of England to adopt a Black child, send her to school and arrange for her to be married in the deeply racial Victorian society.\n\nYou would have thought the unusual peculiarities of that story would offer Anna a special mention in our history, despite our disdain for history. Anna still lurks in the apocryphal and in anonymity while we laud the likes of Lord Lugard, Mungo Park, and Lord Harcourt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story of the young Egbado native; Aina, aka Anna in Ghezo court, Sarah Forbes Bonetta to Captain Forbes and Sally to Queen Victoria, portends some lessons for the present. First, that story put paid to the fantastic tales on why Europe and America should bear all the responsibilities for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Anna proves that African elites were not just sitting idly by in the inhuman trafficking of fellow Africans to the whites. King Ghezo and his ilk make the one-sided calls for reparations ahistorical and tenuous.\n\nSecond, the intervention by Forbes to save \u201csharp and intelligent\u201d Anna from her appointment with the gods directly speaks to our disposition here for wasting human resources. The trajectory on Anna would have led to a tragic denouement but for the providential interventions of the outsider. No doubt, many \u201csharp and intelligent\u201d Anna were swept away by the tide of the 300-year trans-Atlantic slavery, aided and abetted by our past elites. Some were obviously offered as propitiations to the gods by the likes of Ghezo. Sad stuff, how the young; male and female, are still daily ground to dust and sacrificed to the lust and incompetence of our current elites. It seems that our own \u201cmodern-day\u201d Ghezo is insisting on the ruination of our country.\n\nThird and why Anna is relevant is that contempt for life that still looms large here, in her place of birth. Life now is nasty, brutish and short, like in the days of her captivity. Now like then, armed men stomp our homes, roads, and forests in a murderous rage and without fear of recompense. Commuting from one point to another has become a hazardous undertaking.\n\nWhile our Ghezo snores, we receive press releases from men we did not elect, threatening fire and brimstones to victims as the assailants roam unmolested in the forests and IDP camps. Sure, Anna would wince at how things have changed and still remain the same. She would cringe that kidnappers now batter their victims in broad daylight, just like in the old days. Only now, the abductors wield AK-47 instead of bows and arrows as they bay for huge ransoms from their prey. They could not sell them for rewards in foreign now because the slave galleons no longer berth in our docks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet keepers of our portals keep reeling out fantastic numbers, telling us that we are not seeing what we see, that we in fact are better off since we voted them into power.\n\nAnna would be appalled at how little we have done for our country and the Black race since our flag independence 61 years ago. She would be appalled at tribalism and ethnicity fanned by our rulers, the impudence at the highest echelons, and how we do the same thing over again and expect different results. But think of it, who wouldn\u2019t be appalled at us?\n\nWole Akinyosoye, a commentator on public affairs, lives in Lagos",

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

Chris Ngige, expressed this believe while addressing newsmen at the end of a conciliation meeting between the government negotiating team, and the two unions on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nNgige said government had made offers to the two unions, and their representatives would consult with their various National Executive Committees (NEC), and revert back.\n\nThe minister said a lot of work went into the government\u2019s proposal to the two unions, which substantially addressed their demands for judicial and legislative autonomy.\n\n\u201cA lot of work went in. We have exchanged briefs with JUSUN and PASAN.\n\n\u201cThey have their demands, which they had earlier submitted. The government has given counter offers and properly addressed the burning issue of financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nHe said that questions were asked and answered, while critical observations were made and explained, working on the proposal given by the government.\n\nAccording to him, the meeting has been adjourned with a view to enable JUSUN and PASAN take back the government proposal to their members of their National Executive Committees.\n\n\u201cWe expect them to work on the documents from tomorrow and if they are satisfied, they should inform us.\n\n\u201cAnd you know that when they are satisfied, the logical thing is to call-off the industrial action. So, we are to receive their views on the government offer by Tuesday morning,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige, however, said over all, the discussions had been very fruitful, adding that they had moved from the initial position of ground zero, to ground 85.\n\nHe therefore, appealed to the striking workers to return to work to enable government meet the remaining part of their demands.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this when legislation is closed in various states. We cannot also operationalise them when the courts are closed and heads of courts are not allowed into the courts or their offices.\n\n\u201cWe have made documentation and statistics for the state houses of assembly to make appropriate laws. So, we plead that you open the courts and state houses of assembly,\u201d the minister appealed.\n\n\u201cBesides, we are menaced by bandits, terrorists, and arsonists, with the courts closed, the police cannot tackle insecurity, \u201d Ngige said.\n\nResponding, the Vice Chairman of JUSUN Mr Emmanuel Abioye, and the National President of PASAN, Mohammed Usman, both promised to meet with their NEC, to study the situation and consider the offers before reverting back to the Minister of Labour.",

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, said on Friday, that ongoing investigations have revealed many highly placed Nigerians and businessmen involved in financing terrorism.\n\nMr Malami, who doubles as the Minister of Justice, said the \u2018strongly\u2019 suspected financiers were already being profiled for prosecution.\n\nThe minister, who disclosed this while fielding questions from State House reporters in Abuja, said investigations revealing the activities of the suspected terrorism financiers were triggered by a recent conviction of some Nigerians in the United Arab Emirate (UAE) for funding Boko Haram.\n\nThis is coming amid heightened attacks by Boko Haram, non-state actors and other perpetrators of violent crimes in different parts of the country.\n\nDaily Trust earlier in November 2020 reported how an appellate court in Abu Dhabi, UAE, affirmed the conviction of six Nigerians funding the dreaded terrorist group.\n\nThe newspaper also reported in April that dozens of persons had been arrested by security agencies in an ongoing nationwide crackdown on the suspected financiers and collaborations.\n\n\u2018Wider investigations after UAE case\u2019\n\nConfirming the reports on Friday, Mr Malami said the Nigerian government embarked on \u201ca wider and far-reaching investigations\u201d into terrorism financing after the conviction of Boko Haram financiers in UAE.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to report that arriving from the wider coverage investigation that has been conducted in Nigeria, a number of people, both institutional and otherwise, were found to be culpable.\n\n\u201cI mean reasonable grounds for suspicion of terrorism financing have been established, or perhaps has been proven to be in existence in respect of the transactions of certain high-profile individuals and businessmen across the country.\u201d\n\nProfiling\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe investigations are ongoing but have reached an advanced stage\u201d.\n\nHe added that the high-profile persons and businessmen found to be culpable are being profiled for prosecution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to report that investigation has been ongoing for long, and it has reached an advanced stage. Arriving from the investigation, there exists, certainly, reasonable grounds for suspicion that a lot of Nigerians, high-profile, institutional and otherwise, are involved in terrorism financing and they are being profiled for prosecution.\n\n\u201cIn essence, it is indeed true that the government is prosecuting and it\u2019s indeed initiating processes of prosecuting those high-profile individuals that are found to be financing terrorism. It is indeed true.\u201d\n\n\u2018Number of suspects not yet available\u2019\n\nAsked to give the number of persons already arrested for the crime, Mr Malami said the actual number could not be ascertained until investigations were concluded.\n\nBut the minister confirmed that \u201ca large number\u201d of suspects were involved.\n\n\u201cAs to the number, investigation is ongoing and it has to be conclusive before one can arrive at a certain number. But one thing I can tell you is it\u2019s a large number and they are being profiled for prosecution.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a large number, and I\u2019m not in a position to give you its precision as at now because the profiling and investigation are ongoing,\u201d he said.\n\nWarning\n\nMr Malami also warned that no one involved in the crime would be spared.\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: nobody is going to be spared, no stone will be left unturned. We shall certainly and aggressively pursue those people that are involved in terrorist financing as far as the Nigerian State is concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Malami\u2019s disclosure comes amid an increasing wave of attacks by Boko Haram in the North-east which has been the epicentre of the deadly activities of the dreaded terrorist groups for about 10 years.\n\nThere are recent reports that the group has extended its operations to the North-central part of Nigeria, which is still grappling with high incidence of mass kidnappings and killings by armed herders.\n\nIn April, Niger State government said Boko Haram had hoisted its flags in Kaure and Shiroro local government areas of the state.\n\nThe North-central state is about 140km to the Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria\u2019s seat of power.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Sani Bello, who confirmed this on Monday, said the terrorists have displaced over 3,000 residents of the affected communities.\n\nMany believe that the bandits currently terrorising many states in the North-west through mass kidnapping are affiliated or breakaway members of the terrorist group and bandits displaced from war-torn nations in Africa.",

There is no shortage of informational sources out there, and you can easily do your homework on someone to determine how legitimate they are.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important steps you can take is to take your personal brand seriously,\u201d says Sunil Mcrewer.\n\nWith a true passion for making it big, Sunil Mcrewer offers invaluable expertise when it comes to setting yourself apart. While Sunil Mcrewer is highly successful, she is firmly rooted in common sense. Here is some advice she has to offer after building a strong social media presence and a massive fanbase over the years.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know who you are, how will anyone else?\u201d \u201cGet behind something you believe in.\u201d\n\nIf you start something based on something you are not happy about, you will never have the genuine passion needed to be successful. \u201cYou need to wake up each morning excited about your personal brand or your company, not dreading going to work,\u201d states Sunil Mcrewer. This is as important for you as it is for your customers because they will know if you believe in what you are offering them.\n\n\u201cStick with a field you love and offer a product or service that is missing from that field.\u201d \u201cFind your tribe.\u201d\n\nSunil Mcrewer is on point when she says if you don\u2019t believe in your brand, why should anyone else? It doesn\u2019t matter how specialized or niche your business is; potential customers are out there. In all honesty, unique businesses can find unparalleled success by offering solutions other companies don\u2019t. This goes back to the importance of finding your tribe or a highly targeted customer group that shares your philosophies, outlook, and core beliefs.\n\n\u201cYou have to believe in your brand before others can.\u201d \u201cPeople will know when you aren\u2019t genuine.\u201d \u201cTransparency matters more than ever and is a key component of success.\u201d\n\nIf you have built your personal brand on these principles, you have likely based it on something you feel strongly about and have a deep connection to.\n\nThis is the first step to success and one that is sadly overlooked. Do not be blinded by dollar signs; look for something that will make a positive impact as this is what really leads to revenues.",

          "text": "By Makinde Oluwarotimi, Abuja\n\nTransparency Organisations; Follow the Money and BudgIT, have launched the COVID-19 Transparency\n\nand Accountability Project (CTAP), in an effort to promote proper accountability and transparency in governance.\n\nThe main reason behind the establishment of CTAP is to track COVID-19 intervention funds across seven African countries.\n\nFollow the Money, founded by Hamzat Lawal, is an initiative of Connected Development (CODE), a civil society organisation, and is focused on amplifying voices of marginalised grassroots communities in promoting accountability as regards utilisation of public funds, focusing on specific communities across Africa.\n\nAccording to a press statement made available to LEADERSHIP Newspaper and signed by the Communications Associate of CODE, Adaora Okoye, a growing group of young Africans, Nigerians especially, are demanding that the government accounts for the billions of dollars donated/loaned by international agencies, corporate\n\norganisations and individuals to tackle the Coronavirus pandemic and secure the country\u2019s failing healthcare and economic infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOver 60 per cent of Africans distrust the government\u2014given a history of inherent corruption and financial leakages, coupled with widening inequality gap and its poor economic performance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGovernance has also been marked by a lack of transparency, poor accountability, careless leadership, opaque budget systems and lack of civic involvement.\u201d\n\nA summary of the CTAP Research in Nigeria identified some discrepancies in the federal government\u2019s distribution of COVID-19 palliative such as: gaps in the School Feeding Program; shortfall in Conditional Cash Transfer; vagueness of procurement processes; corruption in the NDDC that involved allocation of funds for COVID-19 before\n\nCOVID-19 even happened.\n\n\u201cA clear Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) in response to challenges posed by the pandemic and provision of a fiscal/monetary stimulus package, including support to businesses, would go a long way to make a significant difference.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, during CTAP\u2019s COVID Tracking in some African countries, a lot of findings were made and solutions were proffered. Some of the findings made and solutions proffered include:\n\nIn Cameroon, 180 billion FCFA granted to the National Solidarity Fund and additional contributions, donations and financial gifts received by government are clouded by a hail of corruption allegations, as the health sector is struggling to keep its workers\n\nmotivated and secure, and to grant access to COVID 19 related services to the public;\n\n\u201cIt is crucial for the government to reverse course in its communication and deploy additional means in order to better serve its population in general and the vulnerable communities in particular.\u201d\n\nIn Malawi, delayed responses were construed as deliberate measures to buy time or devise ways of misappropriating funds as later revealed by lack of supporting documents to the reports\n\nthat were submitted.\n\n\u201cLack of preparedness by the department of disaster management affairs in the way they\n\ndisbursed funds without proper orientation of controlling officers. Poor structures and systems that observe transparency and accountability principles, manned by the people of integrity and values, that have the sole purpose of serving and\n\nmaking a difference.\n\n\u201cPoor citizens\u2019 participation in planning and tracking of projects by the local masses makes it easier for officials to abuse or misallocate the public funds because the intended beneficiaries are mostly not aware and sometimes not even interested.\u201d\n\nIn Kenya, COVID tracking revealed that the government employed tax relief policies (Tax laws amendment) bill 2020, established emergency response fund kits and economic stimulus package programmes.\n\n\u201cHowever, despite rising cases of COVID infection, the management and utilisation of COVID-19 funds have been compounded by alleged\n\ncorruption allegations, mismanagement, embezzlement, and procurement irregularities of COVID supplies and equipment.\n\n\u201cThe aforementioned audit and analysis further, revealed that, the following procurement procedures and processes were violated:\n\nUtilisation of unbudgeted funds- according to the special report, Ksh.4.66\n\nbillion was allocated for Universal Health coverage (UHC) when actual cost\n\nshould have been Ksh.2.9 billion; the ministry of Health (MoH) allocated KEMSA Ksh. 13.04 billion and the\n\nactual expenditure amounted to Ksh.8.52 billion.\n\n\u201cHowever, the special audit report notes conflicting information as National treasury notes that Ksh.4.82\n\nbillion was allocated to MoH for Covid-19 related expenditure at KEMSA.\n\n\u201cViolation of procurement processes and methods. As a result, COVID-19\n\nitems worth Ksh.8.39 billion were irregularly procured through retrospective direct method.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, there were discrepancies in distribution of some funds where some people were collecting N20, 000\n\nand others were collecting N30,000. During the COVID-19 lockdown, 4,200 food rations were given to parents in some communities.\n\n\u201cCorruption in the NDDC that involved allocation of funds for COVID-19 before COVID-19 even happened.\n\n\u201cThe greatest obstacle to Covid-19 transparency and accountability is corruption, especially in the case of Nigeria. It is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s political space is\n\nbeleaguered by corruption, particularly in the procurement sector.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\nBy Abujah Racheal\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) said additional 30,452 Nigerian residents received shots of COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, bringing the jabs so far to 1.08 million.\n\n\u201cAs of today, April 16, some 1,081,548 representing 53.8 per cent of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase\u201d, the agency declared on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe 1,081,548, were eligible Nigerians who have been vaccinated in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT),\u201d it said.\n\nThe agency said that the figure was more than half of the percentage of target reached with first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the country.\n\nThe immunisation agency disclosed that out of the 1,081,548 people given the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the country , 8,439 people have suffered mild Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI).\n\nIt added that 52 people had moderate to severe adverse effects on receiving the shots.\n\nIt explained that the mild reactions include body pains and swelling, the moderate to severe adverse effects presented were fever, vomiting, diarrhoea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\nThe immunisation agency disclosed that there was no death from the administration of the vaccine and \u201cno case of blood clots related to the administration of the vaccines have been diagnosed in the country.\u201d\n\nIt said that five states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970); Cross River (859); Yobe (541); Kebbi (511); and Lagos (448).\n\nThe NPHCDA said that the cases were being investigated to ensure they were caused by vaccination.\n\nAccording to it, states with coverage above 100 per cent have vaccinated more than the 50 per cent of eligible population required for the first dose.\n\nThe NPHCDA said that Lagos state topped the total clients vaccinated in the country by administering 200,602 and Kano with 57, 900.\n\nIt said that they were followed by kaduna, 56,238; while Ogun with 52,906 and the FCT with 46,049 had all received their first dose of Oxford AstraZeneca.\n\nFor the country to achieve high immunity against COVID-19, it has set an ambitious goal of vaccinating 40 per cent of its over 200 million population before the end of 2021.\n\nThe country also hopes to attain 70 per cent by the end of 2022.\n\nThe country began vaccination 5 March, 2021 with healthcare workers who are mostly at risk to the infections being the first responders.\n\nIt noted that the proportion of eligible people vaccinated in the country was 52. 2 per cent as of April 15.\n\nNigeria received 3.94 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines through COVAX, a UN-backed effort that promises access to free vaccines for up to 20 per cent of participating countries\u2019 population.\n\nThe delivery is part of an overall 16 million doses planned to be delivered to Nigeria in batches over the next months.\n\nBesides, on March 21, 2021 the country received another 300,000 doses of same vaccines from telecom giant, MTN.\n\nOn April 6, the government of India also delivered 100,000 doses of Covishield COVID-19 vaccines to Nigeria.\n\nThe COVISHIELD, a brand of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine also manufactured is used in over 71 countries including the UK, Canada, India and Brazil.\n\nWith only about 4.4million doses of COVID-19 vaccines available in the country, Nigeria is still far from reaching its set target, according to health experts.\n\nDue to limited doses of vaccine availability, the Federal government directed the states to halt vaccination once it used half of the doses allocated to them.\n\nThe Government said that the directive became necessary since the country was not sure when next batch of AstraZeneca vaccines would arrive the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that in a situation where, we still cannot specifically determine when the next batch of AstraZeneca vaccines will arrive, then I think wisdom only dictates that it is better for us to vaccinate people fully.\n\n\u201cIt is so that we can say that we have a pool of citizens that have been fully vaccinated since this vaccination comes in two doses,\u201d it explained",

          "text": "By Simbo Olorunfemi\n\nYesterday, my attention was drawn to the report by CNN on location of Twitter Office in Ghana. I would not have bothered to go beyond the headline, seeing that what is actually a next to nothing has been framed as a supposed new jollof war. So silly. But it was cited as reference, though ended up not being one.\n\nBut I was stuck by the story for other reasons, from the professional point of view and as a Nigerian. The story has 2 bylines \u2013 Nimi Princewill and Stephanie Busari. Reading through, you might assume this was a promotional for Ghana and a hatchet job against Nigeria.\n\nFirst, what is the rationale or sense in pitching a win for Ghana as a loss for Nigeria? Is it necessarily so? Was there a competition between Ghana and Nigeria over the location of Twitter\u2018s office? Why is the win for Ghana not framed as a loss for South Africa, Kenya or Egypt? Why make it about Nigeria? Is Nigeria, which already hosts Facebook, Google, Microsoft, among others, the only country in Africa? There is nothing in the statement by Twitter, except I missed it, that makes reference to Nigeria.\n\nNow, to the story. Anchored by Nimi Princewill and Stephanie Busari, my first thought was that Nimi must be Ghanaian, as Stephanie is Nigerian, wondering how the Ghanaian was able to pull a positive swing while the Nigerian only pushed a negative narrative. A check seems to suggest that both writers are actually Nigerians!\n\nSo, these are supposedly two Nigerians privileged to write for an international platform. They take on a simple story for Ghana and weave negativity about Nigeria around it, in the name of reporting on ignorance-fueled hullabaloo on Social media.\n\nFrom a professional point of view, it is conceded that some Nigerians took on the Twitter office location in Ghana to talk down on their country. Fact. But is there proof that their position is the dominant one that it must colour how the Nigerian position is presented to the world? I am not aware of any. None was offered in the report.\n\nThis report quotes five Nigerians- Reno Omokri, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji and others. None had any positive thing to say about Nigeria. Let us assume that the reporters are not conversant with the politics of these two men, will they also claim that on Twitter, like other social media platforms, they could not find just ONE Nigerian who took a contrary position to that by Omokri to reference in their story? They did not see the numerous tweets and posts on the presence of bigger Tech giants in Nigeria. Busari and Princewill did not see all the references to location of offices in Nigeria by Facebook, Google and Microsoft? What an unprofessional report with no effort at striking balance.\n\nI have made the point, like many, that the location of a Twitter office is less significant than has been made by some. Of course, it is understandable that the ever ready, desperate brigade looking for firewood to fuel contrived anger will latch at anything, real or imagined, to talk down the country. But, a Journalist should be able to tell when he is running on empty, except on a mission to destroy. It surely cannot be an account of patriotism, except the brand that has been appropriated by Shakabula Activists.\n\nNo one says there are no issues with country, governance or even business environment. But just as there are challenges are there opportunities. There are people and businesses daily taking advantage of these opportunities. Some might choose to ignore where we are coming from, what has been achieved and the direction the journey is taking, but to insist that everyone must ignore gains and wins, but take to perennial lamentation is strange. If you can\u2019t see, others can.\n\nWe know it is the age of faux activism, with some getting high on lows for their country and going low when the country sails high. They lose their voices when things go well and find them, once news breaks, even if fake, that reinforce their biases. Even with plenty of eggs on your face from previous misadventures, they never hold back. They are on a mission. It is an obsession.\n\nThere is a whole multinational industry dedicated to the mining of contrived anger, bottling it up for cash and retailing it to the army of faux patriots, taking advantage of their naivety and gullibility. It is a dirty business. The objective is to run Nigeria down. They have failed.\n\n\u2013Simbo Olorunfemi is a journalist, he wrote from Lagos",

I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles.\n\n\u201cI said shoot anyone found illegally with an AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped.\n\n\u201cPeople must show consideration for their own country,\u201d said the President while speaking on the security challenges, which PEAC said was having great repercussions on the economy.\n\nPresident Buhari, who charged leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noted that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nThe President promised that the federal government would focus on greater development of irrigation facilities in the country, and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nHe said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome the economic challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources; gas, vast arable land, which we are not using enough,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President was reacting to disclosure by Prof Salami, in his presentation, that only 2% of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives were needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nPEAC submitted that the global economy had continued to improve as COVID infections drop and the roll-out of vaccination intensified.\n\nThe council added that the Nigerian economy remained fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are; decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as a basis for revitalizing the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation, and incentives for private investment in irrigation to promote all-year-round farming.",

It is indeed true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: nobody is going to be spared, no stone will be left unturned. We shall certainly and aggressively pursue those people that are involved in terrorist financing as far as the Nigerian state is concerned,\u201d he declared.\n\nNigeria has been grappling with series of security challenges ranging from Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast to banditry in the northwest, kidnapping for ransom in several parts of the country, ritual, agitations for secession among several others.\n\nThe country has been battling insurgency for over a decade with over 36,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the northeast.\n\nAs part of measures to rejig the entire security architecture, President Muhammadu Buhari earlier this year replaced his four top military commanders in a bid to better combat the insurgency that has also displaced more than two million people from their homes since 2009.\n\nISWAP split from mainstream Boko Haram in 2016 and became a dominant group, launching attacks on military bases and ambushing troops while abducting travellers at fake checkpoints.\n\nSince 2019, the army has mostly withdrawn from villages and smaller bases into so-called \u201csuper camps\u201d, fortified garrisons meant to give better protection against attacks.\n\nBut critics say the strategy has left jihadists with more freedom to roam untouched in rural areas and made highways vulnerable to kidnappings and assaults.",

I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury\u201d.\n\nThe President stated this on Friday, during the 6th regular meeting with the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC), led by Professor Doyin Salami in Abuja.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Begins Profiling Of Nigerians Linked To Terrorism Financing\n\nPresident Buhari charged the leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noting that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nHe decried the situation in which some unscrupulous people tried to undermine every policy of the government, irrespective of the good it was meant to achieve for the country.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles. I said shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped. People must show consideration for their own country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari pledged that the Federal Government will focus on the greater development of irrigation facilities in the country, and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nHe said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome economic challenges confronting it, stressing: \u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources; Gas, vast arable land, which we are not using enough.\u201d\n\nThe President responding to disclosure by Prof Salami, in his presentation, that only 2% of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives are needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nPEAC submitted that the global economy has continued to improve as COVID infections drop and the roll-out of vaccination intensifies, adding that the Nigerian economy, though out of recession, remains fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are; decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as a basis for revitalizing the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation, and incentives for private investment in irrigation, to promote all-year-round farming.",

          "text": "The Maldives police have said an explosion that wounded former President Mohamed Nasheed was an act of terrorism but no suspects were identified.\n\nNasheed, the former president and current speaker of parliament, remains in hospital after a bomb attack that left him with serious shrapnel wounds and the Indian Ocean archipelago in shock.\n\nThe 53-year-old had just left his house in the capital, Male, and was about to get into his car late on Thursday when a bomb attached to a motorbike exploded. Residents said the blast was heard across the city.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nHome Minister Imran Abdulla told local media Nasheed\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening. One of Nasheed\u2019s bodyguards was also taken to hospital.\n\nPresident Ibrahim Mohamed Solih went to the hospital where Nasheed, a close ally, is being treated and called an emergency meeting following the attack.\n\nSolih said on Friday the explosion was \u201can attack on democracy\u201d and the Maldives\u2019 tourism-dependent economy, and announced that Australian federal police investigators will arrive on Saturday to assist an investigation.\n\n\u201cNasheed escaped an assassination attempt,\u201d a Maldivian government official told AFP news agency. \u201cHe is injured, but his condition is stable.\u201d\n\nImages on social media showed a destroyed motorbike at the scene of the attack, which was cordoned off by armed police units and security forces.\n\nNasheed has been an outspoken critic of religious extremism in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, where preaching and practicing other faiths are banned by law.\n\nThe Maldives is known for its luxury resorts but has seen rare violent attacks. In 2007, a blast in a park in the capital wounded 12 foreign tourists.\n\nViolence has been blamed on a rise in religious extremism. The Maldives has one of the highest per capita numbers of militants who fought in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSolih said in a televised speech that Australian Federal Police investigators will arrive on Saturday. The Australian Federal Police said its members will engage with Maldives police and assess the assistance that can be provided to their investigation.",

          "text": "Pakistan\u2019s prime minister has started a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia to boost economic ties, the foreign ministry said.\n\nThe two countries are expected to sign new agreements to bolster trade and economic links during Imran Khan\u2019s visit, which comes at the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia gave $6 billion to Pakistan in 2018 when Khan\u2019s government came into power in 2018, but bilateral relations have since witnessed ups and downs. The two countries have a longer history of cooperation, and the kingdom is Pakistan\u2019s main supplier of oil.\n\nDuring his stay there, apart from meeting with Saudi leadership, Khan will also interact with Pakistanis working in Saudi Arabia. Khan\u2019s visit comes days after he recalled Pakistan\u2019s ambassador following complaints by expat Pakistani laborers working in the kingdom who said their own embassy mistreated them.\n\nCurrently, Pakistan\u2019s army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa is also visiting Saudi Arabia. Bajwa was received by Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to Saudi Arabia Bilal Akbar and Saudi military officials in preparation for Khan\u2019s trip.\n\nIn recent years, the relationship between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia after decades of close economic, military and political cooperation suffered several fractures.\n\nIn August last year, Pakistan accused the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a bloc of 57 Muslim-majority countries led by Saudi Arabia \u2013 of inaction over New Delhi\u2019s decision to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its special status in 2019.\n\nWith Kashmir being a key policy issue for Pakistan, Khan threatened to hold a rival meeting that would bypass the OIC \u2013 a move perceived as a challenge to Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership role in the Muslim world.\n\nRiyadh responded by withdrawing $1bn of a $3bn interest-free loan it extended to Pakistan in 2018, at a time when the South Asian nation was suffering dire economic conditions.\n\nAlthough the issue was patched up within days, the diplomatic spat threatened to derail the Islamabad-Riyadh alliance.",
