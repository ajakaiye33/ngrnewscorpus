Increased global demand for chemicals driven by the economic rebound in Asia and feedstock challenges, with several suppliers declaring Force Majeures, resulted in a global shortage of raw materials. This significantly impacted product availability in the first quarter of the year. In addition, there was a scarcity premium placed on all available raw materials which eroded gross margin across various product lines.\n\n\u201cWe have taken steps to secure alternative raw material sources and are increasing inventory levels to mitigate against further disruptions. As such, we expect a strong recovery in the remaining quarters of the year.\n\nOur focus remains on creating shareholder value and we will continue to pursue attractive growth opportunities to achieve this.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

It says it acted because FBN had made significant executive management changes, including replacing the CEO, without prior notice or approval of the regulator. The CBN also highlighted corporate governance failings pertaining to long-standing and problematic related-party exposures, and failure to comply with regulatory directives.\n\n\u201cWe have assessed the near-term financial impact of these actions on FBNH and FBN and believe this is tolerable at the rating level, even though the final outcome is uncertain. In our view, any remedial actions imposed by the CBN, including a potential reclassification of related-party exposures as impaired, will not have a material effect on the group\u2019s asset quality, profitability and capitalisation.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not consider any possible additional actions by the CBN, especially if FBN fails to implement the regulator\u2019s corrective measures or if there were any further uncovering of corporate governance irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe Outlook remains Negative, reflecting FBNH\u2019s pre-existing asset quality and capitalisation weaknesses as well as the group\u2019s corporate governance weaknesses highlighted by the CBN.

To test the ability and the capability of the labour movement in Nigeria. There is another report I heard where the Minister of Finance claimed that she was misquoted.\n\nThe slashing of civil servants salaries is illegal, unconstitutional, a barbaric idea, uncultured, unfair, ungodly and satanic. Why I am saying all this is because this is not the only country experiencing economic meltdown and this type of situation calls for an adjustment that can give us a smooth landing.\n\nIt is not a welcomed idea at all and nobody in their right senses would allow such a thing to scale through. It is just a proposal. It will go the same way it came.\n\nWhich do you suppose should be slashed, salaries of civil servants or that of political office holders?\n\nOur people are not well informed. The total salary put together, the larger percentage of it is earned by the politicians. They are the people getting the larger sum from it by a virtue of their being at the helm of affairs.\n\nThey have aides and also estacode too. Let the politicians reduce all their unworthy expenditures, you would see that we will have a good landing in this country.\n\nOur politicians always like to malign the good workers of Nigeria and also of the states. That is one of the reasons the slashing of workers salaries was proposed.\n\nThe proposal is ungodly and nobody in their right senses will accept it from them.\n\nAs the TUC Chairman in Osun State, is it true that civil servant or service in Osun have been compromised?\n\nIt is very unfortunate that some people don\u2019t understand how things work in the civil service.\n\nThere is nothing like a compromise. We are working according to the ethics of our job. We the civil servants operate under the civil service regulations and general orders. These are both tools that we work with.\n\nThe summary of the whole thing is that we have to work with every government in power. Whoever is saying the civil service in Osun has been compromised is suffering from a lack of information, lack of intellect and unexposed mental illness and they don\u2019t have any idea of how the civil service operates.\n\nThe civil servants in Osun State are a hundred percent with the state government. They don\u2019t have any choice in this case. The labour leaders were not elected to be fighting the government.\n\nI want it to be clear. No labour leader in Nigeria or outside Nigeria according to the International Labour Organisation is elected to fight their government. Rather, what we are elected for is to agitate for the welfare and benefit of our members.\n\nDuring the process of agitation, collective bargaining comes up. This means that both labour and government will seat and fashion out ways of getting to a middle ground that will not jeopardise the interests of both sides.\n\nThese are the things we do in the labour movement and not to fight our employers. We cannot fight the government because it is unheard of for employees to fight their employers.\n\nWhat about the controversy generated when it was reported earlier in the year that labour called on Osun civil servants to embark on strike due to the state government\u2019s failure to implement the national minimum wage?\n\nAs per the issue of Osun being amongst the states that have not started to implement the minimum wage, it was a case of being misquoted.\n\nThough the TUC is not part of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), there was nowhere that Osun State was mentioned in that National Executive Council (NEC) meeting where the decision to carry out the strike action against states that have not implemented the national minimum wage was arrived at.\n\nThe Osun NLC chairman was there as a member of the NEC. This is because Osun State has started the implementation of the national minimum wage in November 2020. So there was no need for Osun to be mentioned.\n\nI am stating categorically without any iota of doubt that we are on course in minimum wage implementation in Osun State and we must continue to appreciate our employer because to whom much is given, much is equally expected.\n\nThe state is amongst the first eighteen states to implement the national minimum wage in Nigeria now. We have no issues with the national minimum wage though we may have in other areas.\n\nWhat if the proposal to slash the salaries is implemented? What course of action would the TUC take?\n\nIt is not feasible. Politicians can implement the policy of the government but it is the civil servants who prepare these policies and also work for them.\n\nThere is no distinction between federal and state civil servants here. It is a law. The national minimum wage is on the Exclusive List and in this list, what is adopted at the federal level is domesticated at the state levels.\n\nIf anybody suggests that satanic proposal, for us that are godly, we will apply them godly. We will kill the proposal and it won\u2019t see the light of the day.",

          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nDespite disbursing $18 billion stimulus package and about N39 trillion loans to customers in the last one year, some vocal critics of the Nigerian banking industry have accused it of being a major contributor to the menace of corruption, poverty, unemployment, insurgency and related crimes ravaging the country today.\n\nAccording to Prof Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno State, whose domain is under the Boko Haram seige, poor banking support for a critical sector like agriculture, particularly in the Northern Nigeria, has affected and weakened the once vibrant sector thereby negatively distorting economic development in the region.\n\nThe governor lamented that as a result of the banking industry failures \u201cthe three geo-political zones in Northern Nigeria are now rated as zones with high poverty indices that are worse than those in other zones. There is insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, robbery, corruption, fraud, stealing and other vices. Indeed, poverty in Nigeria, as a whole, not just in the North, is being caused by corruption.\n\nCorruption has been identified as one of the main threats to Nigeria\u2019s ambition of achieving the 2030 goals of Sustainable Developments and its aspiration to lift more than hundred million of Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years,\u201d Zulum lamented.The governor, represented by Senator Aba Aji, the Secretary of North East Governors Forum, who stated these recently at a public forum in Lagos, added: \u201cThe mainstay of the Northern Nigeria, as you all know is agriculture.\n\nBanks, being the institutions of financial intermediation, are expected to assist agriculture by providing finances to improve production. But inadequate financing has continued to bedevil this important sector and poor banking support for agriculture in Northern Nigeria has created and perpetuated a weak agricultural system in the region. \u201cWhen you go through the length and breadth of Northern Nigeria, you will see rich arable land with vast bodies of water and rivers.\n\nIt all shows that region is blessed with variable minerals such as gold, thyme, bauxite, zinc, limestone, columbite, lead, gypsum and other precious stones. But here, poverty pervades. This is because most of its largely agrarian entrepreneurs who are rural area dwellers could not plug into the formal system due to opportunity barriers created mainly by banks. I, therefore, make a passionate appeal to all bankers to liberalise their lending policies to Northern Nigerian farmers and other entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nA recent report by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on the Depository Corporation Survey report for August 2020 put credit to the economy at N38.67 trillion just as its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed that combined stimulus measures to the economy stood at about US$18 billion, which is close to 4.5 per cent of the GDP.",

          "title": "Banditry: Residents of Abuja suburbs flee",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Molly Kilete and Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja\n\nThe spate of banditry attacks and kidnappings in villages and towns in Abuja sharing boundaries with Niger State have forced most residents to abandon their homes for places they consider safe.\n\nDaily Sun investigation revealed that the most affected towns are Bwari, Kuje and Kubwa where mass exodus of persons have been witnessed recently.\n\nIn Bwari, it was learnt that those who have abandoned their homes cited constant underreported attacks by bandits and frequent abductions of family members by kidnappers as reasons.\n\nResidents of Bwari, who spoke to Daily Sun, said kidnapping is now a regular occurrence, lamenting that streets are now deserted at sunset, over fears that people could be abducted for ransom.\n\nCommunities mostly affected in Bwari are located around the Nigerian Law School, Veritas University and areas bordered by mountains and forests close to Niger State.\n\nSimilarly, in Pegi, a fringe town in Kuje Area Council of Abuja, residents are relocating in droves to the metropolis, as bandits and kidnappers operating in the area have intensified their activities in recent weeks.\n\nThe development in Kuje has forced major schools to shut down. Some of the schools that have shut down are SS Simon & Jude Seminary, Kuje Abuja, Louis Ville Girls, Gwagwalada and Hand Made Girls, Kuje.\n\nResidents living around the mountains in Byazhin, Kubwa, also lament the increase in vices, such as kidnapping and rape. They said strange faces who visit the market from those mountains, occasionally, to buy foodstuffs, are becoming frequent.\n\nThose who spoke with Daily Sun said their environment was no longer safe, as they could no longer go out freely, due to fear of being kidnapped and raped, irrespective of gender.\n\nChioma Okereke, a resident, said that prior to the recent development, it used to be said that kidnappers were after the rich, but lamented that today, it is no longer so, \u201cbecause the hardship in the country has pushed both the thieves and other crime perpetrators to kidnapping because even when they steal, nobody is willing to buy the stolen items.\u201d\n\nFurther investigation revealed that despite the repeated kidnappings by suspected bandits and payment of ransom, the FCT administration, led by the Minister, Muhammad Bello, was yet to summon an emergency meeting with community leaders of the affected areas, on how to address the issue.\n\nIn Kuje, about 37 minutes from the Presidential Villa, residents are not leaving anything to chance. In Pegi, which has become the epicenter of major abductions in Abuja, residents, who are majorly from the southern part of the country, are relocating to the metropolis.\n\nA resident said the place was becoming a ghost town. \u201cThe adjourning road linking the community and Abuja is in a deplorable state. Bandits who operate in a thick forest along the road, lay ambush everyday,\u201d said a resident did not want to be named.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have lived and done business in this area for more than 20 years. I have never experienced the type of fear that we are passing through these days. It is just that it is not easy for one to move with his family to another person\u2019s house. If not, we would have moved.\n\n\u201cThe condition is becoming alarming by the day. These days, we witness influx of strange faces coming to the market to buy foodstuffs, especially during the weekend. We are really scared. Something needs to be done very fast.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Susan Useni, said: \u201cThis country has turned into something else. Before, when you hear of kidnappers, you would say it doesn\u2019t concern you because it was believed to be for the rich; but, today, things have changed. They are now after everyone. This year, almost all my family fruits are wasting in the farm because everyone is afraid.\n\n\u201cThe last group of family members who visited the farmland for harvest ended up paying ransom, depending on what you can afford. Some even paid as small as N10,000. That is to tell you how rampant it has become. Before, you hear religious workers saying they wanted to go up the mountain to pray, but now it is no longer so.\u201d\n\nAminu Alhasan, said they are now after pregnant women and men.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo heavily pregnant women were kidnapped close by here and gang raped. If not for spiritual purpose, how can a normal person settle for another man\u2019s pregnant woman after collecting ransom? Life is no longer safe in this part of the town. On a daily basis, people are kidnapped and money collected quietly.\n\nDespite the fact that Abuja has the nomenclature of a State, the FCT administration has always maintained that the issue of insecurity doesn\u2019t fall within its purview. Instead, it claimed that security agencies, whose headquarters are domiciled in Abuja, should handle the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, there was pandemonium, yesterday, at Karu, a satellite town in Abuja, after commercial motorcycle operators took to the streets to protest the killing of one of their members.\n\nThe protesters set up burn fire, attacked vehicles and passers by.\n\nThe incident, which was said to have started at about 9am saw many Christians trapped in their churches premises until about 2pm when the situation was brought under control.\n\nSoldiers from the Army Headquarters Garrison were drafted to quell the situation which got out of the control of the police.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that trouble started after the Okada riders found the body of one of their colleagues murdered in cold blood and dumped at a valley around the Celestial church and a Muslim cemetery between Nyanya and Karu road.\n\nOn discovering the body, the Okada riders were said to have gathered in their thousands armed with knives, stones, sticks and other dangerous weapons and set burn fire on the major roads, causing heavy gridlock and began to attack innocent persons.\n\nMotorists caught up in the protests were forced to turn back for safety. However, some were not too lucky as they had their wind screens smashed.\n\nOn sighting the police personnel, the protesters were said to have attacked them as more of their members from Mararaba, Masaka, Ado, Nyanya, Jikwoyi and other towns in the area joined their colleagues to attack the police operatives.\n\nIt was gathered that the protest, which started around the Catholic Church in the area, later spread to Jikwoyi, as the protesters were bent on setting the divisional police command there ablaze.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that when the police could no longer handle the crowd, they alerted the military, who immediately deployed soldiers from the Army Headquarters Garrison, to restore law and order.\n\nWhen contacted, the Public Relations Officer for the FCT police command confirmed the report and said the protesters were protesting the killing of one of their members by an unknown gunman.\n\nShe also said the police were working in conjunction with the military were able to restore normalcy. She, however, did not indicate weather or not the police arrested some of the protesters.",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal yesterday indicated that it is considering extending the current equalisation scheme in the petrol supply system in the country to the movement of gas across the country to make the product more available and accessible to Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during an interactive session with energy correspondents in Abuja, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) Management Board, Mr Ahmed Bobboi, noted that when the policy becomes functional, it will help tackle inflation associated with increases in gas products.\n\nPEF\u2019s main function is to ensure price uniformity of petroleum products via the reimbursement of marketers for trucking products to filling stations anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nThe executive secretary stated that the scheme had yet to fully take off because the government was still propagating the use of gas as an alternative fuel and was yet to get its full adoption by the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that 2021 to 2030 had been declared as the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, explaining that a lot of consultations were still ongoing with all relevant agencies to make the proposal become a reality.\n\nBobboi stated that the policy was also awaiting the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) which will clearly spell out the new functions of the PEF, stressing that whatever role is assigned the petrol equalisation board will determine the next line of action on the proposed scheme.\n\n\u201cThis is the (equalisation) scheme that we are trying to extend to gas because the government has declared the decade of gas and we have seen that this has been working for the economy for over 45 years effectively.\n\n\u201cBecause things are much better and if you want to see the benefits, then look at it that in the absence of this scheme what happens to other commodities, the economy, to inflation and then many businesses would have been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s working well for petrol and government wants to promote the use of gas, if we can take the practice to gas, we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain,\u201d Bobboi argued.\n\nHe maintained that when the government extends the practice to the gas sector, it will help many Nigerian homes abandon the use of firewood and reduce deforestation.\n\nAccording to him, it will also eliminate the health hazards associated with the use of high carbon fuels like firewood, especially in rural and remote areas.\n\n\u201cThis will make the product available because we have a lot of gas in the country, it will make it affordable which will incentivise the marketers to take it to the last mile, the consumer will also be incentivised because the marketer will bring down his price. This will do a lot of good to the economy. This is our view,\u201d he noted.\n\nBobboi who took time to break down the continuing relevance of the petrol equalisation fund noted that government was not paying a dime in ensuring parity of petrol price in the country, adding that the consumer pays for it.\n\nThe executive secretary emphasised that \u201cbridging\u201d had become even more relevant because most of the pipelines that were supposed to take the products to many parts of the country had been vandalised.\n\nHe stressed that the original reason for the bridging the policy was to act as a buffer on consumers during turn-around-maintenance, adding that even the existing depots have not been functioning properly.\n\n\u201cThe pipelines have been vandalised, now instead of 30 per cent maximum bridging, it is now about 100 per cent. The cheapest we can have is 98 to 99 per cent because the movement through the pipelines is very low,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Muhammadu Buhari yesterday bemoaned the killings in the country that have worsened the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, condoled with the relatives of those who lost their lives in what he called madness going on nationwide.\n\nThe killings continued at the weekend as bandits murdered no fewer than 11 persons in Katsina and Kaduna States.\n\nAlso, gunmen sustained their attacks on police facilities in the South-east as they hit a police station in Umuahia, Abia State capital.\n\nBuhari, who called for a low-key Eid al-Fitr celebration as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic said: \u201cAs Muslims in Nigeria join others globally in preparations towards Eid al-Fitr, a day that is celebrated to mark the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, President Buhari has directed that all celebrations are limited due to the global Coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the president, first family, his personal aides, members of the cabinet and service chiefs who choose to remain in Abuja will congregate in full compliance with COVID-19 protocols at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, Abuja to observe the Eid prayers by 9:00 am.\n\n\u201cThereafter, there will be no traditional Sallah homage to the president by religious, community and political leaders\n\nas was the case last year, the president encouraged such leaders to be content with modest celebrations at home in view of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Islamic clerics and other religious leaders who continue to pray for the wellbeing of the nation and its people.\n\nThe president called on all local leaders to talk to their youths and warn them against being used to incite and foment violence, saying that \u201cif we attack institutions guarding us, who will protect us in future emergencies?\u201d\n\nBandits Kill 11, Injure Three in Kaduna, Katsina\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 11 persons were confirmed killed while three others were injured by bandits in a fresh reprisal by suspected bandits at Tsatskiya community in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State and another separate attack by gunmen in Kaduna.\n\nA retired army sergeant, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed in the Kaduna incident.\n\nThe bandits who attacked Katsina community on Saturday were believed to be avenging a mob action against two of the bandits\u2019 informants who were reportedly killed by some people in the community.\n\nThe bandits, who were said to have invaded the community in the afternoon, also wounded three others who are currently receiving treatment at a Dutsinma town hospital.\n\nResidents confirmed that the bandits were on a reprisal over the recent killing of their informants.\n\nOne of the informants was said to have been killed four days ago in a nearby community called Hakon Kartakawa.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the incident yesterday.\n\n\u201cDuring the attack, two people were equally wounded and are still receiving medical attention at Dutsinma General Hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the attack, the residents of Tsatskiya community and other neighbouring villages fled the village to Dutsinma town for safety.\n\nIn another incident, a retired army sergeant, Christopher Madaki, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed by bandits following an attack on Golkofa community, Jama\u2019a Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, his son, Mr. Clement Madaki, was only injured.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, confirmed the killings in a statement yesterday in Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the killings took place on Saturday night when bandits invaded the community.\n\nThe commissioner also said a breakdown of law and order was averted in Kachia town, headquarters of Kachia LGA following the alleged killing of one Hamidu Nura by one Abba Muhammad.\n\nAruwan said the killings in Golkofa were reported to the state government by the Kaduna State Police Command and the Defence Headquarters outfit \u201cOperation Safe Haven.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, gunmen attacked a police station, named after a former Inspector-General (IG), Mr. Mike Okiro, in Umuahia.\n\nThe news of the attack caused pandemonium in the town as churches abruptly ended their services to enable worshippers flee to safety.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state command, Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the incident while speaking with THISDAY on phone.\n\nHe said the attack occurred at 9.45 am, adding that the attackers came in a bus and two Sienna SUVs.\n\nHe stated that a police officer was shot and wounded in the leg during the attack.\n\nAccording to the PPRO, the building was not burnt as the roof did not catch fire when torched.\n\nHowever, he said the hoodlums invaded the offices and gathered files, documents and furniture and set them ablaze. Also, two vehicles and two motorcycles on the premises were burnt.\n\nThe attack on the Mike Okiro Police Station was the first such incident in Umuahia although no fewer than four police stations have been razed in the state this year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Accuses gov of becoming bitter after losing vice presidential bid\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan has described the allegation of persecution made against his administration by Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, as a mere figment of his imagination and concocted to attract cheap attention and undeserving popularity.\n\nJonathan, in a statement by his spokesman, Mr. Reno Omokri, said the allegation by el-Rufai that he was to be arrested in furtherance of the second term bid of the former president was untrue.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians may recall that Mr. el-Rufai was on a self-imposed exile during the administration of the late great President Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cMr. el-Rufai only returned to Nigeria on May 5, 2010, the very same day that President Yar\u2019Adua died. He returned because he believed that under then-President Jonathan the atmosphere was more conducive for him. This is borne out by a Wikileaks\u2019 cable, in which Mr. el-Rufai admitted that former President Jonathan is \u2018clean and honest.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter this diplomatic cable was published by local and international media on October 8, 2011, Mr. el-Rufai admitted that he indeed made those comments.\n\n\u201cExactly six days after his return, Mr. el-Rufai visited then President Jonathan at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, on Tuesday, May 11, 2010, and then held a press conference outside the then president\u2019s office, where he made unsolicited comments asking Dr. Jonathan to contest the 2011 elections and said that he would support him.\n\n\u201cAfter the then President named Mr. Namadi Sambo as his vice president, two days later on May 13, 2010, Mr. el-Rufai became very bitter and made plans to leave the Peoples Democratic Party and began to undermine the Jonathan administration.\u201d\n\nThe statement said despite the governor\u2019s anti-government activities, Jonathan declined to move against el-Rufai.\n\nHe said in keeping with the Jonathan doctrine of having no enemy to fight, he refused to move against el-Rufai.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cSecurity reports received by the then president indicated that Mr. el-Rufai was engaged in provocative activities in order to instigate his own arrest, because he felt it would boost his popularity.\n\n\u201cAs such, he made several false and provocative comments that were injurious to Nigeria\u2019s peace, unity and progress, as well as to our good relations with neighbouring nations, including that then-President Jonathan founded and funded Boko Haram to the tune of N50 billion to give Islam a bad name, which Mr. el-Rufai made on September 8, 2014.\n\n\u201cThat then President Jonathan had gone to the Republic of Chad to plan Boko Haram attacks with the late President Deby, which he made on November 25, 2014. And that he el-Rufai, along with [now president] Buhari, and several other prominent Nigerians were on a hit list of people to be shot and killed by the Jonathan administration, which he made on January 5, 2014.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Jonathan resisted the urge to order el-Rufai\u2019s arrest and subsequent prosecution in order not to heighten political tension.\n\nIt said: \u201cMr. Nasir el-Rufai worked closely with then-President Olusegun Obasanjo, who has described him in his book, My Watch Volume 2, as follows: \u2018Nasir\u2019s penchant for reputation savaging is almost pathological. Why does he do it? I recognised his weaknesses; the worst being his inability to be loyal to anybody or any issue consistently for long, but only to Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cHe barefacedly lied which he did to me against his colleagues and so-called friends.

          "text": "\u2022Debates frequent students\u2019 abductions, boko haram attacks\n\nBayo Akinloye\n\nWorried about the nation\u2019s unceasing insecurity, the United Kingdom\u2019s parliament, the House of Commons, has held consistent debates between April 12 and 22 over the continued abductions of students and the sustained attacks by Boko Haream\u2019s insurgents.\n\nThe lawmakers debate, THISDAY understood, centred around understanding the situation in Nigeriaand subsequently providing assistance to her government.\n\nFor example, on April 12, lawmaker Jim Shannon, the Democratic Unionist Party MP for Strangford, sought to find out what discussions the UK government had had with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration on helping to prevent the kidnap of children from schools.\n\nIn response, James Duddridge, the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the kidnapping and continued captivity of schoolchildren by Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in North-East Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe British High Commission continues to raise these cases with the Nigerian government, most recently in March 2021. We are also concerned by the recent attacks on schools in Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, and Katsina states, conducted by criminal groups.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cI publicly condemned these attacks and stressed the importance of all children being able to access an education without fear. The UK Deputy National Security Advisor discussed the abduction of Nigerian schoolboys in Kankara in Katsina State with the president\u2019s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, on December 15, 2020.\n\n\u201cOur High Commissioner in Abuja spoke to the Inspector General of the Nigerian Police on improving school safety and addressing kidnapping in March 2021.\u201d\n\nDuddridge explained that the UK provided mentoring and capacity building for units of the Nigerian Police Force to improve their anti-kidnap capacity and response to organised crime groups in Nigeria.\n\nThe following week, on April 19, another UK lawmaker, Stephen Doughty, the Labour (Co-op) MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, demanded from the British government an assessment of the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East following recent attacks and the displacement of people in the Damasak area.\n\nDuddgride explained that the UK government was concerned by the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East, where terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa, continue to attack local communities.\n\nShedding more light on his assessment, he noted, \u201cRecent attacks on Damasak in Borno State, in which civilians, humanitarian workers, and facilities were targeted, have led to a worsening humanitarian situation, and the displacement of local residents and internally displaced people to Niger or other areas of north-east Nigeria. As the UK government has repeatedly made clear, humanitarian workers should never be a target.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated to the House of Commons that the UK remained \u201ccommitted to helping Nigeria tackle the threat posed by the terrorist groups\u201d in the North-East, adding, \u201cWe are providing significant humanitarian and stabilisation assistance to support affected communities, including those who have been displaced.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s findings also showed that 60 to 69 UK-based staff were posted by the then Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development and currently Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office to all posts in Nigeria as of March 31, 2021.\n\nOn April 20, another legislator Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, asked specifically about the threat to Christians amid killings in Nigeria.\n\nIn response, Duddridge stated that the UK condemned all violence against civilians in Nigeria, irrespective of religion. He pointed out that in the North-East, terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWA, \u201ccontinue to cause immense suffering to both Muslim and Christian\u201d communities.\n\n\u201cThese groups seek to undermine the right to freedom of religion or belief by indiscriminately attacking those of all faiths, who do not subscribe to their extremist views,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further told the House of Commons that intercommunal violence across multiple states also \u201chas a devastating impact\u201d on Christian and Muslim communities and disclosed that the \u201cunderlying drivers of violence are complex, and frequently relate to competition over resources and increasing criminality.\u201d\n\nOn April 26 and 27 April, the UK minister disclosed that he met with \u201ca range of Nigerian interlocutors, including governors\u201d from some northern states and Nigerian government representatives, including the foreign affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama.\n\n\u201cI raised the need for all communities to be protected amidst increasing insecurity\u2026We will continue to encourage the Nigerian government to take urgent action to protect all communities and to implement long-term solutions that address the root causes of violence,\u201d he told the parliament.\n\nThe UK envoy also told the House of Commons about the issues of LGBT in Nigeria, noting that the UK government is worried about the criminalisation of homosexuality, recognising that there is a long way to go before all LGBT people can live free and equal lives in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking of the country and others in Africa, Duddridge explained, \u201cWe make regular representations to governments around the world on this issue, including in Uganda, Ghana, Namibia and Nigeria. We work through our Embassies and High Commissions, as well as international organisations, including the UN, Council of Europe, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Commonwealth, to promote non-discrimination towards LGBT people, and to address discriminatory laws.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe directly challenge governments that criminalise homosexuality at the highest political levels.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Remember that we had some form of state, regional police. We had an ordinance 4 of 1916 that formally established regional police, native authority police in the north, and also in western Nigeria,\u201d Nnamani said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere were factors that led to the abolition of state police. With the 1966 coup and the emergence of the Ironsi government, a government committee was appointed to study policing in Nigeria. They presented their report in 1968. All those factors that led to the abolition of regional police and formal entry into the state police have not changed.\n\n\u201cNigeria is organic; it\u2019s one unit. For you to have state police, it means it has to be uniform in the 36 states; it has to be standardised in the 36 states. If it is not uniform, then it is inherently unequal.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have state police in a state like Lagos state with a poverty rate of 10 to 20 percent, compared to states that have poverty rate of 81 percent. How are you going to pay them?\n\n\u201cSo, if you police Lagos effectively, what is the guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to police states in other regions effectively? The standards are going to be different. Then, of course, there are the factors that led to the abolition of state police in the beginning \u2014 elite capture of the system, influence by political and traditional players.\u201d",

          "title": "Uganda wants to replace its social media tax with a 12% tax on internet bundles",
          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

          "text": "Paystack, a fintech company that powers growth and payments for businesses in Africa, today announced its official launch in South Africa after a six-month pilot. The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust. And there is no better source in Nigeria (today) like Meat247 powered by Livestock247.com",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

The world has lost a great soul. This is the reality of life. He is no longer enslaved by death and death has no dominion over him anymore.

          "text": "Over two thousand hectares of land with titled documents have been given by 24 states for the Buhari administration\u2019s Social Housing programme, while 17 states have indicated interest to participate in the Solar Power programme, both important elements of the ongoing Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\nEqually, an agreement has now been reached with at least one major cement manufacturer in the country to sell at significantly discounted prices as low as N2600 per bag of cement for the social housing projects. This was after a meeting the vice president held with three major cement manufacturers in the country namely Dangote Cement, Bua Cement and Lafarge Cement manufacturers.\n\nThese were some of the highlights emerging from a review meeting on the Economic Sustainability Plan implementation presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa over the weekend.\n\nCommenting on the implementation of components of the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), Mr Osinbajo said the Buhari administration will continue to focus on creating more jobs while improving access to power and affordable housing for the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHighlighting the progress so far, the vice president assured that the federal government will ramp up efforts so more Nigerians have access to electricity and affordable housing.\n\nAccording to the presentation made by the Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Ahmad Salihijo, the Solar Power Naija team has had engagements with the six states who have identified private sector developers. The team has also selected Akwa Ibom, Ekiti and Kano as pilot states for the state-guaranteed transaction model for the solar power programme.\n\nHe explained that REA is currently tracking transactions worth N55 billion potentially contributing the first two million connections in Nigeria and providing thousands of jobs.\n\nFor instance, the programme is currently tracking four transactions in the commercial bank upstream channel contributing 3,500 jobs and 100,000 connections.\n\nThe MD added that nine participants have submitted applications for over N4 billion of the N20 billion allocated with three companies close to receiving disbursements.\n\nAccording to the MD, \u201cBleu Camel Energy with a loan amount of N3 billion is targeting to create 600 jobs; Sunking, another investor with a loan amount of N3 billion will create 1,500 jobs; Auxno Solar with N300 million loan amount targets 100 jobs while Emerald Industrial Co. is seeking N3 billion funding to manufacture 100,000 Solar Home Systems and smart meters.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand but in the same vein, the Managing Director/CEO of the Family Homes Fund Limited (FHFL) \u2013 the implementing agency for the Social Housing scheme, Femi Adewole, stated that 17,584 units across 16 locations are now in the pipeline.\n\n\u201cWe are having a successful push in assembling land to feed the housing construction. So far about 2156.4ha have been assembled ready for development. This has the capacity to accommodate about 65,000 homes,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Adewole further said that under the ESP Social Housing programme, Nigerians would be given at least a 15-year period with a monthly payment at six per cent interest rate to pay for each housing unit.\n\nWhile the rates are significantly low, the MD noted that this period can also be extended through refinancing.\n\n\u201cThis will help to improve access to housing for low-income people in the informal sector who-(otherwise) will not have an opportunity to access a mortgage,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further said that in addition to the typical 2, 3, and 4-bedroom housing units, the FHFL was considering a \u201cStudents and Young People\u2019s Housing \u2013 to address the needs of young people.\u201d\n\nAn agreement with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has now been finalized and signed by Family Homes Funds, he disclosed, while drawdown is subject to a guarantee from the Ministry of Finance.\n\nIt would be recalled that the CBN had committed to a N200 billion facility with a guarantee by the FG via the finance ministry for the Social Housing scheme.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking further, the FHFL MD noted the agency has struck partnerships with Dangote Cement for the provision of cement at subsidised rates to construct the ESP homes, adding that \u201cwe expect to reach a similar agreement with the other two majors shortly.\u201d\n\nHe added that the FHFL has signed an MoU with the ESP Solar Power project including three suppliers to provide low-cost solar panels to the homes.\n\nMr Adewole stated that the delivery of the units would be through SME Delivery Partners \u2013 who are being encouraged to register on the Housing Portal.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo far about 7,333 SME groups and individuals are registered on the online portal. Up to 2,000 of these will be involved in current projects.\n\n\u201cWe will be drawing from ongoing experience on our project in Yola where the construction of 3,600 homes are ongoing and a partnership between FHFL and the Ministry of Housing is implementing a large-scale youth employment scheme currently employing 1350 young people. The young people are manufacturing interlocking tiles, paving, screeding, etc.\n\nFor the ESP Social Housing Adewole said \u201cabout 228 Manufacturers of Building Components have expressed interest in supplying inputs including doors, glazing, paint, roofing sheet, etc. We are now engaging with these to secure bulk supply of key materials which in turn will provide opportunity to grow their production capacity.\u201d\n\nAlready sites for early start projects have been identified in all the six geo-political zones in addition to the FCT. The sites include those in Ekiti and Ogun in the South-west, Enugu, and Abia in the South-east, Delta, and Edo in the South-south, Yobe, and Bauchi in the North-east, Kaduna, and Katsina in the North-west and Nasarawa and Plateau in the North-central. Sites have also been identified in Abuja including at Dei Dei where the VP earlier visited to see the sample designs of the Social Housing homes.\n\nSpeaking specifically on the mass housing scheme, Mr Osinbajo emphasized that the focus must be on providing affordable housing for the masses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the federal government is going to intervene in housing, most of it should be social housing. Everybody else, including the private sector, can build N9.6 million worth houses, but nobody else will do social housing.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, when government intervenes, it is social housing\u2026those who cannot afford housing are the ones we must focus attention on.\n\n\u201cI think that we have enough problems with finding homes for the vast majority of Nigerians who cannot find a home. The people who are poorest who have no houses are the people we should target because that is what government should do. Let\u2019s focus on this social housing.\u201d\n\nThe vice president added that the federal government will continue to collaborate with states to ensure more Nigerians benefit from the social housing scheme.\n\nUnder the Social Housing Programme, the federal government plans to support 1.5 million Nigerians to acquire low-cost houses through mortgage options and also Rent to Own option. The scheme is expected to also generate 1.8 million jobs and deliver houses to about 1.5 million Nigerian families. The houses are to be priced around and N2 million and N4 million each putting it within the reach of the low-income earners, depending on the number of rooms. There are one, two and three bedrooms options.\n\nLaolu Akande\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity\n\nOffice of the Vice President",

          "text": "By Israel Bolaji-Gbadamosi\n\nOne of the key metrics that well defines a truly 21st century brand beyond profit making is its ability to connect with customers and stakeholders as a complete enabler, touching on vital aspects of their lives, creating exciting memories and enabling them to access more enjoyable and convenient lifestyle, in shopping, studying, working, traveling, family living, entertainment and aspirations.\n\nIts ability to also give back to the community through tangible corporate social investment programs that significantly translate to improved living and not just mere formality and publicity stunts is also pertinent.\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Limited (FirstBank) is giving a good account of itself in this regard not only as a truly financial powerhouse but also as a life enabler, helping Nigerians live better and achieve their dreams.\n\nIn retrospect, banking, decades ago, was essentially about providing financial services and products to merely aid customers\u2019 financial transactions. However, the smart ones are indeed changing the game. Not only is the envelope being pushed to ensure that the unbanked are banked through financial inclusion offers even to the remotest villages, FirstBank has taken banking to another level. Backed by superior technology firepower and capacity, it is assisting not only adults but also Nigerian youths to live better and fulfil their dreams.\n\nThe Nigerian nation and the most populous black nation of the world indeed has a youths bulge as observed by many experts with a growing army of young and vibrant people below 25 years of age constituting over 60% of its 200million population! While an unrelenting rate of unemployment, weak economy, soaring inflation and despair appear to dominate the national mentality, many youths are finding solace in entertainment, breaking the ceiling with their creative ingenuity, shunning out award winning hits and in fact making global headlines in music and other entertainment offshoots like movies, comedy skits and contemporary dance.\n\nNigeria\u2019s 29 year old singer, Damini Ogulu popularly called Burna Boy in March shocked the world winning the world\u2019s most coveted Grammy Award in the Best World Music category during the 63rd annual edition in Los Angeles Atlanta while another 30 year old Nigerian artiste, Ayo Balogun aka Wizkid was also a co-winner in the Best Music Video category for Beyonce\u2019s Brown Skin Girl. These young Nigerian global music icons were raised and honed their skills in the suburbs of Nigeria through home grown competitions and platforms.\n\nMusic reality shows have also unveiled and nurtured music and entertainment talents like Timi Dakolo, Iyanya, Praise, Omawumi and other A-list musicians in Nigeria. This is why FirstBank\u2019s intervention and sponsorship of a music and youths talents harnessing platform like The Voice Nigeria is strategic and instructive, and quite capable of helping to harness and nurture music and entertainment talents into celebrated musicians, make global stars of Nigerian youths, and truly help them achieve their dreams. Obviously, Firstbank has been a prominent force visibly empowering talents and the nation, and without the much-needed lifeline, many young talents would be taking to crime or other vices.\n\nFor over 127 years, the premier bank has been at the forefront of nation building; supporting through resourceful partnerships to build the Nigerian creative industry value chain which contributed 2.3 per cent (N239 billion) to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2016 (NBS).\n\nThe bank\u2019s support for the Voice Nigeria is also a demonstration of its commitment to contributing to the projected revenue of US$86m by 2021 from the Nigeria\u2019s music industry aimed at promoting a diversified economy in line with the Federal Government\u2019s diversification policy.\n\nThe bank assured that it has given voice to Nigerians for the past 127 years, and will continue to give voice to Nigerians by creating employment, economic empowerment in the country through its products, services and initiatives and it remains committed to strengthening the creative industry which is fast growing into a multibillion-dollar business, with potential to be a leading contributor to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in the near future.\n\nIn fact, FirstBank has the network; reach and digital capability to enable the Voice. With its agent banking network across the nooks and crannies in country, it is helping in the search for the talent that will become a true inspiration to all.\n\nTrue to the name, the Voice Nigeria has lived up to its promise, as it offers exciting and relaxing entertainment to families, music lovers, and other entertainment loving Nigerians who look forward to fresh seasons and episode of the well-crafted music program.\n\nNow in its season 3, the Reality TV show has been a masterpiece in the last six episodes of the current season as viewers are serenaded by several awesome performances and display of raw talents on the show\u2019s blind auditions which ended on Saturday, May 1. The episode ended with raging emotions, exhilarating sensations and blistering anticipation as the four judges \u2013 Falz The Bad Guy, Waje, Yemi Alade and Dare Art Alade had one final opportunity to forge their winning team.\n\nSo far, the coaches, hosts, producers and amazing talents have been a great delight to watch. They have been awesome with their good-natured banters, hilarious drama, top-notch fashion, electrifying opening performances, talent courting speeches, and chair turning and bell thumping spectacle. The optics is exciting! The expectation on the show has been so intense; you could cut with a butter knife. The coaches\u2019 approach at winning talents over to their team has been fun and a fine blend.\n\nThere were no holds barred, as the judges were very warm, animated, upbeat, inspiring and full of energy. They were definitely not a team of avuncular examiners waiting to pass judgments. They brought much gusto and effect to the big stage! While Falz threw up his magical comic card severally, Dare maintained the cool dude posture while Yemi and Waje both brought on the alluring feminine appeal with Waje sometimes speaking in Igbo to convince a talent. In all, they fared well, each getting a fair share of talents to mentor and their combination depicted a perfect combo.\n\nThe talents on their part have not disappointed viewers. They came in different shades across both genders, with varying voice textures, mix and pitches \u2013 smooth, silky, velvet, shrill, husky, coarse or simply rough. And to the best of their abilities, they did justice to many songs, including some classic tunes and old hits. The creative fusion of multiple genres of music by some smart talents who beautifully delivered unique blend of music made good impressions which won the judges hearts. The awful looks on the faces of those who the judges would simply not behold, having failed to captivate their attention with the voice. The uncontrollable joy of those who got the bell ring and standing ovation and the incredible looks on their loved ones who came to show support. Not forgetting the jazzy presence and reassurances from the co-hosts including Toke Makinwa and Nancy Ikime which also complimented the soothing potpourri.\n\nInterestingly, FirstBank made some smart moves on the show, with the bold inscription of \u201cThis is the moment you have been waiting for, Time to put You First\u201d, clearly displayed at the entry of the contestant for the stage performance. This reinforces the bank\u2019s thrust as an inspiration to motivate the talents and youths at large to excellence. It has also promised viewers mouth-watering prizes just by watching the show regularly and following updates on FirstBank verified social media handles.\n\nNow that the Blind auditions stage has come to an end, it is game on! The next phase of the show is the highly anticipated Knockout Stage which starts on May 8. In this stage, the coaches will select the most outstanding talents to proceed to the battles. In this stage, there is so much to come and fans will certainly not be ready for all that is in store.\n\nMore than ever, the show\u2019s fans are hopeful that the knockout stage will even be more entertaining but that will certainly not be a challenge with the dexterity of the handlers so far.\n\nWith all that has been seen so far, it is difficult to believe that this is only the beginning; it is certain that there is so much more to come.",

          "text": "Olakunle Idowu\n\nAn Islamic scholar and Judge of the Shari\u2019ah Court of Appeal, Kwara State, Abdur Raheem Ahmad Sayi, has called on the Federal Government to devise a technology to regulate access to the internet with a view to checking misguided information, particularly those capable of fuelling security and religious crises in the country.\n\nThe cleric who observed that the unfettered access by Nigerians, especially the youth, to the loads of \u201cmisinformation\u201d on the cyber space has contributed immensely to the present security challenges in the country, warned that failure by the government to do the needful might spell doom for the unity of Nigeria.\n\nJustice Sayi made this call in his lecture at the 2012 Special Ramadan Iftar programme, organised by the Ogun State government, held at the Arcade Ground of the Governor\u2019s Office, Oke Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nThe theme of the programme was \u201cThreats to National Security and Unity: Religion as a Panacea or Problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cleric, internet could be educative, entertaining and informative, but promoters of hate and disunity in the country had used it to spread messages of discord and fake news among Nigerians, hence government must find ways to curb the menace before it is too late.\n\nHe noted that the country is atop a keg of gunpowder and if no efforts are made to check the social malaise, things could get out of hand.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhat Nigeria is currently witnessing in terms of insecurity will be a negligible fraction of chaos that will come.\u201d\n\nThe judge urged leaders of Islam and Christianity in the country to desist from preaching about prosperity alone, but inculcate the core values, tenets and teachings of love and unity of mankind, in the minds of their adherents.\n\nHe further charged religious leaders to use religion as instrument to foster unity and oneness, rather than to promote discrimination, hate and disharmony.\n\nHe also urged media practitioners to continue to play a pivotal role in reversing the trend of insecurity by imbibing and practising responsible journalism, which according to him will go a long way in preserving societal peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking, the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, said the special Ramadan Iftar programme was a symbolic one, being the very first to be hosted by his administration.\n\nHe noted that the programme was in appreciation of the fervent prayers, solidarity and support his government has enjoyed from the Muslim community in the last two years.\n\nWhile describing the theme of the Iftar programme as apt and instructive, especially when considering recent challenges to security and unity not only in Nigeria, but around the world in general, Abiodun urged the people, irrespective of their religious persuasion, to always engage only in acts that promote security, peace and unity of Nigeria\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cneither of the two major religions in the country supports banditry, insurgency, kidnapping or rebellion against the State.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that \u201cthe leaders and followers; government and people, have the responsibility towards the security and unity of our nation. Otherwise, our actions and inactions without responsibility towards one another become threat to national security and unity.\u201d\n\nHighlighting steps taken by his administration to restructure and reinvigorate security mechanism in Ogun, Abiodun said that the Security Trust Fund was reconfigured and made private sector led, adding \u201cwe made huge investments in patrol vehicles and communication equipment for our security agencies in the state and initiated regular meeting of the State Security Council that had been in limbo before the inception of our administration.\u201d\n\nHe also said his administration had created initiatives to fully and productively engage the hitherto restive youth via the development of Ogun State Job portal, a database of unemployed or underemployed youth, Anchor Borrowers Scheme and FADAMA GUYS.\n\n\u201cIn my inaugural speech about two years ago, I made a commitment that ours is an administration that will observe all elements of good governance \u2013 that we will be fair, just, equitable, open, transparent, accountable, inclusive and obey the Rule of Law. Two years down the line, I am proud that even our worst critics will readily admit that we are a promise keeping administration with manifest delivery of electoral promises across the state. It is also generally acknowledged that we have been even-handed in our dealings with all parts of the state and the strata, regardless of religious belief, political persuasions and ethnic affiliations.\n\n\u201cAgain, I reiterate that I may have been elected on the platform of a great party, All Progressives Congress (APC, of the Christian faith and from a part of our state, I am and will continue to act as Governor of all good people of Ogun State. This is an element of the tripartite covenant between me and God on one hand, and between me and good people of Ogun State who have entrusted me with the mandate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined the Muslim faithful to take full advantage of the Holy Month, particularly the last ten days, to harvest the bountiful divine benevolence, seek forgiveness and pray for security and unity of the country.",

          "text": "*Lockdown measures, ban on International flights curtailed spread\n\n*Procurement of vaccine remains our top priority \u2013 FG\n\nSince the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has consumed many lives and hurt many economies around the globe. In this special report, Correspondent, PHILIP CLEMENT examines the proactive step Nigerian government took in tackling the pandemic.\n\nThe novel coronavirus disease since its breakout in December 2019 in Wuhan China, has spread across the world and caused massive havoc both to human lives as well as different sectors of the world\u2019s economy.\n\nRecalled that the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, and on March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, while urging countries to take urgent and concerted action to tackle the scorge.\n\nSubsequently, on February 27, 2020, the Federal Ministry of Health confirmed the first COVID-19 case in Ogun State, Nigeria, making the country the third country in Africa to recognise an imported COVID-19 case after Egypt and Algeria. The index case occurred in an Italian citizen who flew from Milan, Italy to Lagos.\n\nAs part of response to tackle the pandemic headlong, the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari constituted the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 was established by the President of Nigeria on March 9, 2020, with the mandate to coordinate and oversee the country\u2019s multi-sectoral and inter-governmental efforts both to contain the outbreak and to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nThe PTF led by Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the government of the federation swung into action and provided Daily media briefings were held to enlighten Nigerians on evolving evidence, address trending issues and provide update on the government\u2019s response.\n\nAlso it provided Technical evidence-based recommendations from the PTF informed the President of Nigeria\u2019s policy decisions for the various phases of the outbreak.\n\nOverall, Nigeria\u2019s response strategies were aimed at suppressing the transmission of COVID-19 by testing all suspect cases, isolating all confirmed cases, and tracing all contacts of confirmed cases, with the implementation of country-wide or regional non-pharmaceutical interventions as appropriate programme for health care workers.\n\nSteps taken to curb covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria\n\nThe first major step taken by the government to curtail the spread of the covid-19 pandemic was to impose a national lockdown and inter-state travel restriction.\n\nThe aviation ministry also announced ban of international flight to and fro the country through the aviation minister, Hadi Sirika.\n\nAs it were, the initial 30 confirmed cases COVID-19 in Nigeria were travellers from abroad or their immediate contacts.\n\nThis informed the initial international travel ban for passengers coming from countries with ongoing high transmission (initially China, Italy and Germany; subsequently extended to eight high-burden countries) to minimize rising imported cases.\n\nConsequently, land borders were closed, all international flights were banned, and mandatory institutional quarantine and testing for international returnees to Nigeria was instituted on March 23, 2020 to reduce further importation of the disease from high-risk countries.\n\nThe second step was to step up health preparedness and boost treatment capacity. During the lockdown period, the NCDC worked with all states to enhance contact tracing activities and increase capacity for case detection and treatment.\n\nTreatment centres were expanded from an initial single centre in Lagos with 35 beds, as of February 29, 2020, to 38 centres with 1055 beds by April 14; by May 30, 2020 Nigeria had 121 treatment centres with 6550 beds.\n\nIn the four-week period, the number of laboratories able to carry out COVID-19 testing increased from the initial three to 13 laboratories in 10 states as of April 15, to 28 in 18 states by the end of May.\n\nMore than 13 000 health care workers were trained on IPC as well as on COVID-19 case management and personal protective equipment (PPE) and response commodities were deployed across the country to reinforce and better prepare the multi-sectoral response.\n\nDespite bans on interstate travel, the virus had already spread geographically. Ten states reported their first COVID-19 cases during the first 14-day phase of the Federal lockdown, while an additional 13 states reported index cases in the second phase of the lockdown. Index cases in several states were traced to domestically exported cases from Lagos State and FCT.\n\nNearly three-quarters (74%, n = 7532) of current cases have no known epidemiological link, suggesting substantial community transmission. Cumulatively, as of May 31, 2020, 337 of Nigeria\u2019s 774 LGA have reported a confirmed case.\n\nNigeria mounted a swift and aggressive response to COVID-19, leveraging on its existing epidemic preparedness and learning from other parts of the globe where transmission began earlier.\n\nThe country\u2019s initial response included early activation of the national EOC at the NCDC, establishment of the multi-sectoral COVID-19 PTF, and decisive actions to stop international travel and impose a time-limited lockdown in highly affected areas.\n\nBy rapidly implementing this set of interventions, Nigeria likely slowed down the rate of virus transmission and bought extra time to implement a robust case detection, testing, and treatment centre capacity.\n\nHowever, these efforts, especially testing, needs more private sector involvement to significantly ramp up COVID-19 diagnostic centres across the country. Sensitising and mobilising citizens to take responsibility by strict implementation of preventive non-pharmaceutical measures is key to flattening the curve.\n\nA rapid, holistic, cohesive, whole-of-government approach that encompasses civil society and local-communities in the response will be absolutely critical to combating the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and rebuilding stronger health systems towards adjusting to a \u201cnew normal\u201d.\n\nSubsequently, as the country began to ease lockdown, international flights resumed on August 29, 2020 the first time in five months.\n\nNigeria\u2019s minister of aviation, Hadi Sirika, said the resumption of international flights was justified after no in-flight infections occurred during the restart of domestic flights on July 8.\n\nSirika also warned that any travelers who manage to skip the tests will be put on a travel watch list.\n\nHe stated that the federal government also intends to impose a $3,500 fine on airlines that allow coronavirus patients to board planes.\n\nThe decision was highly commended by Industry players in the aviation sector who believe that the ban was in order.\n\nAlso, as the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the federal government through the Presidential task force imposed new lockdown restrictions in December 2020.\n\nThe Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, stated that that the directives were advisories issued to state authorities for implementation .\n\nThe new restrictions include civil servants from Grade Level 12 and below to stay at home for the next five weeks; the closure of all bars, nightclubs, pubs and event centres, as well as recreational venues in all states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAll restaurants were also directed to close, except those providing services to hotel residents, takeaways, home deliveries, and drive-ins.\n\nSimilarly, all informal and formal festivity events, including weddings, conferences, congresses, office parties, concerts, seminars, sporting activities, end of year events, have were restricted to not more than 50 people.\n\nThese steps had gone a log way in further putting the country at risk of another second wave of the pandemic, considering what countries like the United Kingdom and India are currently facing.\n\nVaccination efforts\n\nIn the first week of March this year\u2019s the federal government received 3.94 million doses of the Astra zaneca vaccine in a bid to begin mass vaccination and protect Nigerians against the deadly Covid-19 virus.\n\nWhile taking delivery of the vaccine, Boss Mustapha said the arrival of the Astra-Zeneca vaccines marks a significant milestone in the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nThe SGF observed that COVID-19 had claimed over 2.5 million lives worldwide but the development of vaccines and accelerated process for emergency authorisation had brought hope to humanity all over the world.\n\n\u201cI therefore urge all Nigerians to continue to comply with the non-pharmaceutical measures, even as we roll out the vaccines administration plan, which is expected to reach 70 per cent of our population between 2021 and 2022. Under the circumstances, it must continue to be NPIs + Vaccines.\u201d\n\nCurrently statistics from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency says that over 1 million Nigerians have been vaccinated against the Covid 19 virus.\n\nIn the same vein, The federal government reinterated it\u2019s committment in Procuring additional 29 million doses of the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed said the prhe AVAT initiative, that is coordinated by AfreximBank\n\nSpeaking recently at a \u2018Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI) General Assembly webinar, she said: \u201cTherefore, the supplementary budget for COVID-19 vaccines will cover the cost of additional vaccines over and above those provided by COVAX, as well as the full cost of operations and logistics for delivering the vaccines around the country.\n\n\u201cAlready, the sum of N29.1bn has been released from the Routine Immunization budgetary provision (Service Wide Vote) to the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) as an advance for the operational cost of deployment of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe N29.1bn represents about 52 percent of the amount required over 2021-22\u201d, she said.\n\nMrs. Ahmed stated at the 18th General Assembly of CABRI that the World Bank has indicated willingness to provide needed facilities in support of our COVID-19 vaccination plan.\n\nShe added that \u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 70 percent of eligible (18 years and above) Nigerians over the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the nation has received commitments from COVAX for COVID-19 vaccines that could cover 43.1 million of the eligible population, as donations from some development partners.",

          "title": "Opinion: Legislators\u2019 oversight visit to Sambisa is overdue \u2013 By TONNIE IREDIA",
          "text": "Last Thursday, I was slightly amused listening to Senate President, Ahmed Lawan pouring encomiums on the service chiefs of Nigeria\u2019s military. When the report by the broadcast media on the event started playing, I had thought it was a valedictory session where some war veterans were taking a well-deserved bow.\n\nBut when it became clearer that the day\u2019s celebrants were the General Lucky Irabor led new service chiefs, I had to put off my initial doubt to watch more closely to find that the colourful reception by the Senate for the team was real and that it departed substantially from the old familiar song whose chorus was that no one knows into what use the military had put the huge resources appropriated and allegedly received by them. It was as if the Senate had just discovered how well the funds had been meaningfully utilized. If so, what was the source of the new information?\n\nI mean was it credible evidence obtained from oversight function? I just hope the Senate\u2019s position was not informed by the predictions of any of our vision-seeing members of the clergy! Whatever the source, one thing which is certain, is that no one can blame a television viewer for being cynical; after all, the general narrative on ground has been one of despondence in which the public had been made to believe that funds meant for the military were usually diverted by the top hierarchy leaving nothing for the troops to prosecute the insurgency war. Indeed, when the last service chiefs left office, there were reports of jubilation in military circles especially at the war front which tended to validate the rumour that military funds were truly misappropriated. Although there were official attempts to clarify the statement credited to the National Security Adviser NSA that weapons and equipment that should have been bought were not bought, the general feeling which subsisted was that the funds were missing.\n\nThere was in fact the allegation by the International foundation against corruption that about N10.02 trillion spent on the security sector in Nigeria has had no audit report from 2015 till today. So, why was the Senate President presenting a vote of thanks in favour of the military? Could it be that the legislature suddenly discovered that the military leaders were innocent of all charges against them and that the funds reportedly appropriated for the military never got to them? I found that slightly hard to believe because Zainab Ahmed, our Minister of finance, budget and national planning who should know, had confirmed two days earlier,that all the funds were released.\n\nThe Minister spoke at an interactive session with members of the Senate Committee on the Army.\n\nShe also asserted that apart from funding the budget of the army almost 100 per cent, there had been a lot of instances where the security leaders went to the president, got special approvals and still got the funds. Interestingly, the Chairman of the same committee, Senator Alli Ndume had continuously complained that funds for the Army were not received by the Army.\n\nHow then, can one understand our insurgency fight where the appropriation, delivery and receipt of the resources for the fight are turned into a story of several versions? This confusion would not have arisen if oversight functions are implemented creditably in Nigeria. But painfully they are not. Elsewhere, what touches a nation most is the concern of all; in which case, Nigerians should have been mobilized by government to focus on our current major problem which incidentally concerns the security and welfare of the people.\n\nThe legislature represented by her several committees on the military should have designed a monitoring framework covering when a request is made by the military, when it is approved, when it is dispatched, when it is received and how it is spent. We ought not to have subjected our military to the distraction of spending much time pursuing approved funds. In other words, a team of legislators should have since been stationed in Sambisa by way of symbolically carrying supervision to the very point of assignment as they do, all the time, especially with lucrative agencies such as the NNPC. If that had been done, the new service chiefs would not have, on assumption of duty and indeed before settling in, be called to account for purchases made by their predecessors.\n\nWhy was there no oversight at the appropriate time? Honestly, oversight functions by the legislature have in the last one year dropped significantly. In August 2020, thirty-nine (39) Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) issued a joint statement accusing the National Assembly of not only a drop in her oversight functions but a general lack of commitment to duty. The CSOs arrived at this conclusion after a study of the performance of the lawmakers for the legislative year beginning from June 2019 to July 2020 in which they found that the legislators sat for only 149 days instead of the 181 days prescribed by the constitution.\n\nThis may have been caused by the propensity of the legislators to enjoy several holidays and adjournments. For example, although all other public sector services had only two days declared as public holidays last month for Easter, the legislators were away for the same festivity for three weeks.\n\nThey have in the last three days already begun their own Sallah holidays, yet to be officially declared by government and they are not expected back till May 18th. We, therefore, agree with the CSOs that there ought not to be a drop in legislative activities by the National Assembly at a time when its role has become more critical than ever before, in joining the Executive to find solutions to the unprecedented challenges currently facing the country. We also believe that our legislators should revive their mechanism for their constitutionally approved oversight functions provided, they remove from it, the tendency to commercialize the subject.\n\nThe old order whereby legislators blackmailed some Ministries, Departments and Agencies into settling their travelling costs etc. must be halted. In addition, there is the need for the legislature to always get to the logical end of every investigation. Not many were pleased for instance, with how the allegations made publicly that NDDC contracts were cornered by legislators was swept under the carpet.\n\nThis attitude has always adversely affected public expectations whenever the legislature jumps into every matter as if nothing must go past them without their input. The posture no doubt has a fair share in the failure of Nigeria to have strong institutions. When for example, there is some emergency in any part of the country, and the very next day the legislature passes a resolution \u2018directing\u2019 NEMA to help the victims of the occurrence, it suggests that the entity has no capacity to independently face its mandate.\n\nIt also removes from them, personal initiative and discretion. Such interventions are only rational in cases where the resolution was provoked by transparent lethargy on the part of the relevant societal institution. It is worse when the legislature disrupts the schedule of duties of public bodies through incessant summoning of chief executives who are never allowed in what looks like \u2018a show of ego\u2019 to delegate their appearance. It is particularly offensive when it is done to the military that should be encouraged to completely face the nation\u2019s current difficulty of incessant killings in several parts of the country.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe families of the late Tolulope Arotile, Nigeria\u2019s first female combat helicopter pilot are seeking quick dispensation of justice in the case investigating the incident while led to the death of their daughter.\n\nArotile died in an accident on July 14, 2020, at the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) base in Kaduna at the age of 24.\n\nHer father, Akintunde Arotile, during an interview with Channels Television in Lokoja, Kogi State capital, on Saturday said he is yet to heal over the sad incident and he is more disturbed by the prolonged case investigating her death.\n\nHe added that his wife, mother to the late Tolulope, is more disturbed as she daily laments over the delayed case with justice yet to be served 10 months after.\n\nRELATED:\n\nComic Book Launched In Honour Of Tolulope Arotile\n\nArotile\u2019s Death: Suspect Charged For Culpable Homicide\n\n\u201cWe are trying as a family to put a closure to the whole thing particularly with the case that is still in court. Up till now, it has not been easy. If the case has been concluded we will try and see if we can put a closure to that chapter and we will just mourn her till maybe when I and my wife will die.\n\n\u201cBut the case is still on. I don\u2019t even know when the next hearing will be. My wife is so disturbed because of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you have an open wound that is not healing. If the case is concluded, our minds will be at rest,\u201d he said at an event organised by the Kogi State Government and unveiling of a cinema movie project in Tolulope\u2019s honour.\n\nMr Arotile stressed that if only justice can be served as soon as possible, their minds will be put to rest.\n\n\u201cTo show that you cannot just kill a serving officer, a pilot in the Air Force Base premises and the case is being treated as nobody.\n\n\u201cYou know our normal judicial service system, the case keeps dragging on\u2026that is a problem for us,\u201d Mr Arotile lamented.\n\nThe NAF had earlier in July 2020 released its preliminary report on the death of Tolulope in a car accident at their base in Kaduna.\n\nThe Force in the report revealed that Ms Arotile was killed by her friend who mistakenly hit her with his vehicle.\n\n\u201cUpon recognising their schoolmate, Arotile, after passing her, Mr Adejoh, who was driving, reversed the vehicle, ostensibly in an attempt to quickly meet up with the deceased, who was walking in the opposite direction. In the process, the vehicle struck Flying Officer Arotile from the rear, knocking her down with significant force and causing her to hit her head on the pavement. The vehicle then ran over parts of her body as it veered off the road beyond the kerb and onto the pavement, causing her further injuries,\u201d air force spokesperson, Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement containing the report.\n\nThe air force after the release of the preliminary investigation handed over the suspects Nehemiah Adejoh, Igbekele Folorunsho, and Festus Gbayegun to the at the NAF Base Kaduna.\n\nThe news of Arotile\u2019s death in July 2020 shook the nation, leaving many saddened by her demise at a prime age.\n\nThe NAF later immortalised Arotile in September by naming a Pilot\u2019s Crew Room after her.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nAs leaders and experts continue to propose how Nigeria can overcome the problem of insecurity, a former governor of Enugu State believes state police is not an option.\n\nSenator Chimaroke Nnamani was of the opinion that adopting state police as a solution to the security challenges would be a wrong move because the factors that led to the abolition of regional police were still very much available.\n\n\u201cThat is not the solution. State police will not work in Nigeria,\u201d he said when he featured as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\nHe added, \u201cRemember that we had some form of state police \u2013 regional police, we had an ordinance of 1916 that formerly established regional police. There were factors that led to the abolition of state police.\n\n\u201cAll those factors that led to the abolition of the regional police and formal entry into the central police have not changed. Nigeria is organic, it is one unit and what that means is that if the eye is having a problem, the brain could have a problem.\u201d\n\nAn Unjust System?\n\nThe former governor, however, stated that having state police would only function effectively if it was made to be uniform in all 36 states of the federation.\n\nHe warned that should state police not be in uniform and standardised in all the state, it would amount to what he described as an inherent inequality.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, it is an imbalance to have state police in a state like Lagos where the poverty rate is very low compared to other states with a higher rate of poverty.\n\nOn the way forward, he suggested a conference of ethnic nationalities to help address the imbalance said to have been created by the constitution.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a country of multi-ethnic African nationalities \u2013 those ethnic nationalities are in Nigeria on basis of inequality.\n\n\u201cThe constitutions that have been derived from all these fora are inefficient, unequal, and unjust because those constitutions are results of political machinations of people who got the people to make the constitutions together,\u201d said Nnamani.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat we need is a conference of ethnic nationalities on equal basis. Multi-ethnic nationalities have to conference and produce a system that is equitable, fair, and just.\n\n\u201cThe system, as it is \u2013 the National Assembly, State assemblies\u2026, are inherently unjust because of the way they were derived.\u201d",

          "text": "The death toll in a horrific bombing at a girls\u2019 school in the Afghan capital has soared to 50, many of them pupils between 11 and 15 years old, the Interior Ministry said Sunday.\n\nThe number of wounded in Saturday\u2019s attack has also climbed to more than 100, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian.\n\nThree explosions outside the school entrance struck as students were leaving for the day, he said. The blasts occurred in a mostly Shiite neighborhood in the west of the capital. The Taliban denied responsibility, condemning the attack.\n\nThe first explosion came from a vehicle packed with explosives, followed by two others, said Arian, adding that the casualty figures could still rise.\n\nIn the capital rattled by relentless bombings, Saturday\u2019s attack was among the worst. Criticism has mounted over lack of security and growing fears of even more violence as the U.S. and NATO complete their final military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack targeted Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic Hazaras who dominate the western Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood, where the bombings occurred. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims\n\nThe area has been hit by violence against minority Shiites and most often claimed by the Islamic State affiliate operating in the country. No one has yet claimed Saturday\u2019s bombings.\n\nThe radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan\u2019s Shiites. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nSoon after the bombing, angry crowds attacked ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He had implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.\n\nBloodied backpacks and schools books lay strewn outside the Syed Al-Shahda school. In the morning, boys attend classes in the sprawling school compound and in the afternoon, it\u2019s girls\u2019 turn.\n\nResidents in the area said the explosion was deafening. Naser Rahimi told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, and immediately thought that the sheer power of the blasts meant the death toll would almost certainly climb.\n\nOne of the students fleeing the school recalled the attack, the girls\u2019 screams of the girls, the blood.\n\n\u201cI was with my classmate, we were leaving the school, when suddenly an explosion happened, \u201c said 15-year-old Zahra, whose arm had been broken by a piece of shrapnel.\n\n\u201cTen minutes later there was another explosion and just a couple of minutes later another explosion,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was yelling and there was blood everywhere, and I couldn\u2019t see anything clearly.\u201d Her friend died.\n\nOutside the Muhammad Ali Jinnah Hospital, in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood dozens of people lined up to donate blood, while family members checked casualty posted lists on the walls.\n\nMost of the dozens of injured brought to the EMERGENCY Hospital for war wounded in the Afghan capital, \u201calmost all girls and young women between 12 and 20 years old,\u201d said Marco Puntin, the hospital\u2019s programme coordinator in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a statement following the attack, the EMERGENCY Hospital said the first three months of this year has seen a 21 per cent increase in war-wounded.\n\nIS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.\n\nEven as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.\n\nEarlier the group took responsibility for the targeted killing of three women media personnel in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.\n\nThe top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some \u201cbad possible outcomes\u201d against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.",

          "text": "Dozens of Palestinians have been injured in Israeli police crackdown on protesters outside the Old City of Jerusalem as tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers prayed at the nearby Al-Aqsa Mosque on Islam\u2019s holy night of Laylat al-Qadr.\n\nAt least 90 people were injured on Saturday, the Palestine Red Crescent said, a day after Israeli forces stormed Al-Aqsa and injured more than 200 Palestinians. Israeli police said at least one officer was hurt.\n\nIsraeli security forces on horseback and in riot gear deployed stun grenades and water cannon against Palestinian youth who threw stones, lit fires and tore down police barricades in the streets leading to the walled Old City gates.\n\nTensions have mounted in the city, the occupied West Bank and Gaza throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, amid growing anger about the potential eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem homes on land claimed by Jewish settlers.\n\nIsraeli border guards have, during the past few days, used skunk water, tear gas, rubber-coated bullets and shock grenades to disperse sit-ins held in support of the families facing eviction in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.\n\nAt least 205 Palestinians and 18 Israeli officers were injured in Friday\u2019s confrontations, which drew international condemnations and calls for calm.\n\nThe four members of the Middle East Quartet \u2013 the US, Russia, the EU and the UN \u2013 have expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the violence in Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cWe are alarmed by the provocative statements made by some political groups, as well as the launching of rockets and the resumption of incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel, and attacks on Palestinian farmland in the West Bank,\u201d the envoys said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Envoys noted with serious concern the possible evictions of Palestinian families from homes they have lived in for generations\u2026 and voice opposition to unilateral actions, which will only escalate the already tense environment.\n\n\u201cWe call upon Israeli authorities to exercise restraint and to avoid measures that would further escalate the situation during this period of Muslim Holy Days.\u201d\n\nMedics reported that at least 64 Palestinians have now been wounded in the latest clashes with Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem \u2013 mostly by rubber bullets, stun grenades or beatings.\n\nThe wounded includes minors and a one-year-old, and 11 people were taken to hospital, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nIsraeli police said at least one officer was hurt.\n\nIsraeli police detain a Palestinian during clashes at Damascus Gate on Laylat al-Qadr during the holy month of Ramadan, in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City [Ronen Zvulun/Reuters]\n\nAn estimated 90,000 people gathered for nighttime Laylat al-Qadr prayers at Al-Aqsa, the third-holiest site in Islam.\n\nLaylat al-Qadr or the \u201cNight of Destiny,\u201d are the most sacred prayers.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent has said 53 Palestinians have been injured in clashes with Israeli police in East Jerusalem on Saturday night.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Harry Fawcett, reporting from Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem, said there had been a \u201crepeated cycle of clashes and calm\u201d in the area between Palestinian protesters throwing plastic bottles and Israeli security forces deploying stun grenades and foul-smelling skunk water.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen some running scuffles, with people being dragged to the ground and beaten [by police] \u2013 not being arrested, but sent on their way.\u201d\n\nMohammed el-Kurd, a Palestinian resident of Sheikh Jarrah, has shared footage of Israeli police violently dispersing a sit-in by Palestinian protesters in the neighbourhood.\n\nIn one video, a group of policemen is seen destroying tents and pushing people away from the protest site. Another clip showed an officer violently dragging a Palestinian woman along the road.\n\nAn emergency Arab League meeting scheduled for Monday is unlikely to produce any change in Israel\u2019s behaviour unless Arab states, notably those that have normalised relations with Israel, decide to take meaningful action, said Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera\u2019s senior political analyst.\n\n\u201cUnless the Arab League does take some serious initiative, including putting some of those states that normalise relations with Israel on notice, unless some of those Arab countries use their leverage, whether it\u2019s diplomatic or other, with Israel, I think we will see simply more statements,\u201d Bishara said.\n\n\u201cStatements that are perhaps loud in denunciations and condemnation, but very short or low on actionable leverage in terms of forcing Israel, or its allies, not only the United States, to act in order to stop the repressions of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nIsraeli police have used rubber-coated bullets and skunk water to disperse protesters in Jerusalem\u2019s Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, an Al Jazeera correspondent said.\n\nHundreds of protesters are currently gathered in the vicinity of Othman Ben Afan street, where Palestinian families threatened with evictions live, the correspondent added.",

          "title": "Kaduna Governor El-Rufai, Benue Counterpart Ortom Trade Words Over Insecurity in Nigeria",
          "text": "The disturbing security situation in Nigeria appears to have turned two governors against each other as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom have thrown caution to the wind, attacking each other over the security situation in the country.\n\nNasir El-Rufai fired the first salvo, ostensibly in support of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he claimed Governor Ortom only uses the insecurity in his state to attack the Buhari-led administration as a way to cover up for his own failure.\n\nBut an obviously agitated Ortom immediately fired back and came down heavily on his Kaduna State counterpart, accusing him of not only misleading President Buhari to gain favours, but also one of the real enemies of the country.\n\nEl-Rufai, who first hit at Ortom while responding to a video, which featured Ortom addressing protesters after some killings in Benue State, during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group, claimed he no longer took his Benue colleague seriously.\n\n\u201cI did not hear what Governor Ortom said (in the video) but I know him and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, El-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating El-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his state several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.",
