          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n*Lists measures to tame the prices\n\nBy Emeka Anaeto and Cynthia Alo\n\nDangote Cement Plc may have stepped up its expansion programme in response to the recent developments in the cement market in Nigeria. The development may have also forced the dominant player in the market to consider halting its export programme.\n\nSpeaking to the media yesterday on the public outcry over the rising prices of cement in Nigeria, the Group Chief Commercial Officer, Dangote Industries Limited, Rabiu Umar, who made these disclosures attributed the development to market forces saying that demand has recently outstripped supply.\n\nListing the measures Dangote has taken in response to the situation Umar stated: \u201cWe have invested in a new line that has been completed in our Obajana plant. That line is waiting for the power plant for us to start to bring out the cement .\n\n\u201cWe have a new line now in our plant at Opela in Edo state, that is also going to start operation soon. For the last couple of years, one of our plants in Gboko, former Benue cement, has not worked for almost four years. We have now started that plant, all in a bid to make sure that there is enough production.\u201d\n\nResponding to the allegation that cement producers are complicit in the retail price increases, Umar stated: \u201cAs we all know with every other items, what drives the price is actually demand and supply. Now, as a business, Dangote has not increased price up till this point. Therefore, what has happened is that the forces of demand and supply have been the main driver of what people are talking about, the prices of cement going to extra amounts of money.\n\n\u201cThe only way to deal with that is to make sure that you have adequate supply capacity because if you do not produce enough no matter what you do, there will be break in the supply chain and that will always create some opportunity for arbitraging.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is to make sure that we increase the supply of the product in the market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the supply side measures Umar also disclosed that the company is intervening in the transportation and distribution logistics to starve off possible cost sleeping into the pricing issue.\n\nConsequently, he said Dangote is injecting 2000 units of new trucks with some of them ordered from local truck manufacturers, the Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company, ANAMCO, in Enugu.\n\n\u201cWe are buying these trucks and putting them all there to make sure that the distribution is also taken care of\u201d, he added.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "FG to effect three new changes in PIB \u2014 Investigation",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n*As Presidential Council proposes Single Industry Regulator\n\n*NNPC for public offer\n\n*Deregulate price of gas to power plants\n\nBy Udeme Akpan\n\nTHE Federal Government has concluded plans to effect three new changes \u2013 a single regulator, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC\u2019s public offer, and deregulation of the price of gas supplied to power plants \u2013 in the nation\u2019s Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB.\n\nInvestigation by Energy Vanguard, showed that the three changes have already been proposed by the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, PEAC, as part of measures targeted at making the PIB more effective and beneficial to the nation, and were being considered by the government.\n\nREAD ALSO Activist sues Obaseki over non-appointment of commissioners\n\nUnder the current PIB before the National Assembly, the government had proposed to put in place two institutions, a Commission for Upstream Regulation and an Authority to oversee mid and downstream regulation.\n\nThe PIB did not have many details on deregulation of gas pricing and immediate steps toward ownership as well as future structure of NNPC.\n\nBut in its presentation to the 6th Regular Meeting of the PEAC with the President, May 7, 2021, obtained by Vanguard, Professor Doyin Salami-led PEAC said a single regulator, sale of the NNPC shares to the public, and deregulation of gas price would make positive impact on the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe council, which reports directly to the President, has the responsibility to advise the President on economic policy matters, including fiscal analysis, economic growth and a range of internal and global economic issues working with the relevant cabinet members and heads of monetary and fiscal agencies.\n\nPEAC\u2019s Recommendation\n\nSpecifically, it stated: \u201cOne regulator with relevant departments will be more efficient and allow for greater synergy in regulating the entire industry value-chain. Examples are Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC.\u201d\n\nOn the NNPC, it stated: \u201cPrepare company for Initial Public Offer so the enterprise can raise its own funding. Board composition should have more independent members for governance.\u201d\n\nOn the price of gas to power plants, it stated: \u201cDeregulation is key to stimulating investment. To avoid price shocks, a transitional arrangement can be included. Such arrangement must specify timeline to end price regulation.\u201d\n\nThe Council also identified other issues, which deserve urgent attention, stressing that, \u201cEnactment of the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB through the National Assembly will not of itself immediately stimulate investment needed in the Oil and Gas sector. Nigeria should identify key strategic projects that will enable the achievement of the various objectives \u2013 ranging from increased oil production through expansion of gas pipelines.\n\n\u201cThese projects should then be the subject of discussion with Oil sector operators \u2013 International Oil Companies, IOCs and Indigenous companies. A process of accelerated approval can be established \u2013 similar to the NLNG model in 1982. The intention is to ensure that before the end of this administration, investment decisions can be taken.\u201d\n\nNational Assembly\n\nNevertheless, in an interview with Vanguard, Sunday, Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on PIB, Hon. Mohammed Mongunu, said: \u201cThe PIB is an Executive Bill, meaning that the government is free to make changes in it.\u201d\n\nNNPC reacts\n\nSimilarly, in a text message to Energy Vanguard, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, NNPC, Dr. Kenny Obateru, stated: \u201cNNPC is owned by the government and the people of Nigeria. The ownership structure that shall be prescribed for the Corporation in the PIB shall, once passed into law and accented to, automatically become the new ownership structure of the Corporation.\u201d\n\nExperts\n\nHowever, in an interview with Energy Vanguard, the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, GNPC Professorial Chair in Oil and Gas Economics and Management, Institute for Oil and Gas Studies, University of Cape Coast, Ghana, Prof. Omowumi Iledare, said: \u201cThis is excellent advice that I identify with wholeheartedly. Of course, they are but advisory purely on what ought to be for value creation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, political expediency seems to matter much more than economic optimality. Most often than not, politics tend to trump economics. At least one can say without mincing words that those three recommendations put posterity much higher than prosperity.\u201d\n\nIn another interview with Energy Vanguard, the Executive Director, Spaces For Change, Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Bill 2020, is a proposed law seeking to introduce far-reaching industry reforms in the Nigerian oil and gas sector. Among other objectives, the bill aims to establish good governance, best practices, and ease of doing business in the industry by clarifying roles and responsibilities of officials and institutions, enable frontier exploration, mandate improved environmental compliance, and transform NNPC into a commercially viable enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe laws regulating the oil and gas industry date back to pre-independence and pro-democracy rule in Nigeria when laws were made without inclusion and in the light of the peculiarities at that time. With the advancements in technology, the volatility of oil prices, climatic changes influencing the driving forces of the global economy, it has become imperative to review extant laws to bring them in alignment with current realities. Also, the law governing the industry is dispersed in a maze of legal frameworks and byelaws numbering over 16. Some of these laws contradicted each other while regulatory functions also overlapped. This means that the conflicting statutory provisions and overlapping regulatory powers between enforcement agencies offered violators and polluters the advantage of cherry-picking which law and regulator to obey.\n\n\u201cFirst, the bill proposes two regulatory bodies\u2014 Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority. They will exercise regulatory authority over all aspects of the industry, enforce standards and promote an enabling environment for investment in the Nigerian Petroleum Industry. The second development to note is the emergence of Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited to carry out all crude and petroleum-related businesses commercially such as lifting and selling crude, royalty oil, profit oil, gas, etc. This company will replace and take over the assets and liabilities of the current NNPC.\n\n\u201cThird, the incorporation of host communities\u2019 development trusts provides for the creation of a Host Communities Development Trust. The oil operators, described as settlors, are obligated to incorporate a trust for the benefit of the host communities and shall make an annual contribution to the host Community Development Trust Fund of an amount equal to 2.5 per cent of its actual operating expenditure.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFourth, the licensing regime will change. The Upstream Commission shall be responsible for granting petroleum exploration licences. A petroleum exploration licence shall be for three years and may be renewable for an additional period of three years subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nRecently, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, confirmed the existence of the B.1.671 variant of the COVID-19 virus (first detected in India) in Nigeria.\n\nThe Director-General of the NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, gives insight into the development and other related aspects of the National response to the pandemic. Exerpts:\n\nNew variant\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has been working very hard with its partners to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on Nigerians.\n\nIt is unfair to label the new variant \u201cIndian variant\u201d because it was detected first in that country.\n\nThat it was first detected in India does not mean it actually came out of India and the B.1.617 strain can now be found in 44 countries around the world.\n\nAstraZeneca vaccine\n\nWhen you look at our risk in today\u2019s virus and I like talking about it in three broad categories:\n\nOne is the risk associated with the virus itself, and new variants. The second is how we mitigate that risk, third is what people do.\n\nHuman behaviour and population behaviour is the link to the guidelines that have just been issued. Be rest assured that we are working very hard to find the viruses and sequence them.\n\nWe have about four million vaccine doses and from the efforts that we put into these from different agencies with each dose, we know that the vaccine is very efficient.\n\nThe primary focus of our work is to get new supplies of vaccine doses so we can start to vaccinate a new set of people, and so for the first set we have almost completed two million vaccinations.\n\nIn a few weeks\u2019 time literally, everyone that got the first dose will be invited for the second dose and we have assured everyone that there is a second dose waiting for him or her.\n\nLagos, FCT, Kaduna have all gotten a little bit more than other states because of the burden of the infection.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe vaccination programme has had its challenges. Yes, there was quite a bit of hesitancy in the beginning but I think we are ending strong and the challenge is on our side to work with the global supply chain to make sure we have more vaccines in the country to give to our people.\n\nThe third area was the reissuing of the guidelines. Nothing in those guidelines is actually new, what happened was we generally stopped adhering to them across the country. We started behaving as if nothing was happening as if there was no pandemic.\n\nAnd learning lessons from what happened in India, a country that is very similar to ours in many ways, understanding what triggered the resurgence of the virus in India. It is most likely to link to religious festivals and election campaigns that brought people together, all creating superspreader events. the thing with India is that not just that the numbers increased, the numbers increased exponentially.\n\nSo could this really be puzzling to us that one, two, three, or four superspreader events happening one after the other, are like the election campaigns or religious festivals or whatever else like the Christmas period that led to the second wave in Nigeria?\n\nIf we let these things happen in Nigeria, they will act as incredible risks, and this is something that we do not want and must do everything possible to prevent.\n\nIt is really for the state governments to enforce the guidelines and ensure that people comply. We the citizens must play our part, in fact none of us can do this on our own, we must continue to work together with all the people\n\nVaccination\n\nRight now, there is no evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine is less efficacious against the strain from India.\n\nThe challenge we have is getting enough people vaccinated as quickly as possible in order to prevent them from having the infection.\n\nBut we are working very hard and that is our biggest challenge due to the global (vaccine) shortages. Secondly, the challenge we talked about, is the enforcement at the state level; to me one of the high points the pandemic has brought out in this response is the relationship of states with the federal government.\n\nReduction in new cases\n\nOne thing that Nigerians can take 100 percent to the bank is that we will be as transparent as possible as we can with all the numbers of testing and sequencing at all times. For the number of cases that we find have, we announced it every night.\n\nThe numbers have reduced significantly. Testing is still very good we test 30,000 to 40,000 people every week and out of that we have 1.0 per cent positivity rate. So we have out of every 100 people we test, one will be positive. We are fairly positive and confident in the robustness of our numbers and that is validated by many other data seen.\n\nThe number of people that walked into the hospitals with respiratory symptoms has reduced across the board. The number of calls that we get in our call centres has reduced. People dropped their guard and that is human behaviour. It is normal that there will be some form of complaints. It is very hard to manage a treatment centre that is empty the first month and second month with a team of doctors and nurses.\n\nSuch scarce resources cannot be kept in a treatment centre with no cases. What we are now encouraging at the centres is to manage human resources but to always keep some resources available.\n\nWe managed to get through a very tricky situation last year and now our numbers are low let\u2019s not get complacent and let us hold on to the fragile game and be doing what we are doing both as a people and as a government.\n\nHerd immunity\n\nThe first thing is that vaccine fraud is not really as simple as many people assume it is. It is complex. Let me explain it in three ways. Firstly, the supply side, the development of new vaccines from candidates to new vaccines. We have seen miracles that happened last year, many vaccines were developed some are still in the pipeline.\n\nThe efforts are now going on but that has now highlighted the deficiency of manufacturing capacity from the continent completely, so there is an effort now from the African CDC and African Union to ensure that many African countries are better placed in the development and manufacturing of vaccines, so that is very important that it is happening. What that has led to is that there is a supply deficit. As much as you would like to throw money at it, whether it is appropriated, whether is available, the challenge is that there is no vaccine to buy. The supply has been so limited.\n\nWe banked on getting most of our vaccines from COVAX, which then relied on India for most of their supplies. But when the escalation of cases started in India, the supply was pushed further down the line. So we have a delay in getting the second batch of the vaccines.\n\nWhat the government is doing right now is mitigating the delay through various other arrangements both through bilateral and multilateral efforts with the African Union. We are still fairly confident in a month or two we will get the next set of vaccines arriving in the country.\n\n4m vaccine doses\n\nThe NPHCDA has worked intensively with the states to manage the four million doses more than any African country. Just under two million has been administered and the rest have been kept for the second dose to ensure every other person that got the first two million get the second side. We have been managing to match supply with demand.\n\nThe NPHCDA sometimes has been busy countering a lot of negative statements from people in the society you would not really expect such to be coming from. But so far, we have managed the available supply.\n\nWe have big voices in the international space that the current level of access to vaccines is a shame to the global community, that we can not accept a world whereby such a large population simply does not have access to vaccines because of an inability to pay. There is a big effort at the moment to ensure equitable access. We have medium-term challenges to make sure we are never in a position like this in the future.\n\nHow do we do this? By investing in research and development. Research into vaccine manufacturing and then lift some of the technology bottlenecks. We have done these in some other sectors.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",
          "summary": "We have about four million vaccine doses and from the efforts that we put into these from different agencies with each dose, we know that the vaccine is very efficient.\nIn a few weeks\u2019 time literally, everyone that got the first dose will be invited for the second dose and we have assured everyone that there is a second dose waiting for him or her.\nLagos, FCT, Kaduna have all gotten a little bit more than other states because of the burden of the infection.\nThe challenge we have is getting enough people vaccinated as quickly as possible in order to prevent them from having the infection.\nBut we are working very hard and that is our biggest challenge due to the global (vaccine) shortages.",

This necessitated the amendment of Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) which the president signed in August 2020, paving way for the commencement of implementation of disclosure principles.\n\n\u201cThe Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020 has provisions dealing with disclosure of Persons with Significant Control (PSC) who have, at least, five per cent of voting equity holding or voting rights and who are ultimate beneficial owners of such registered entities to disclose such interest\u201d he said.\n\nIn his welcome address, Minister of Budget and National Planning, Clem Ikanade Agba, disclosed that the Global Support Unit of the Open Government Partnership through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund awarded a grant of $400,000 to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis grant is managed by the World Bank and we are at the final stages of documentation for the release of this grant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further noted that the OGP Multi-Donor Trust Fund, Open Government Partnership with the support of development partners and working together with World Bank, established the OGP Multi-Donor Trust Fund (or the MDTF) to support World Bank client countries and local entities that participate in OGP or intend to become eligible to participate in OGP.",

The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages. To this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\n\n\u201cThe meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\nThe meeting also thanked Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State \u201cfor being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South West Zone, to ensure that PDP takes over majority of the states in the Zone.\n\nApart from Makinde and Tambuwal, the PDP governors that were also in attendance are the vice chairman of the forum and Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu; Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Duoye For (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Godwin Onadeko (Edo), and Nyesom Wike (Rivers). Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State was represented by his deputy, Mahdi Mohd.\n\nMeanwhile, the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that it did not come to him as a surprise hearing the governors, under the umbrella of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), describing the APC-led government as rudderless and incompetent.\n\nIn a reaction to the communique the PDP governors issued after their meeting, in Ibadan, yesterday, the former Edo State governor said that having deployed the same format to remove them from office, they are just paying the APC in their own coins.",

Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the PDP governors called on Buhari to immediately send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the constitution to devolve more powers to the states to enable governors to effectively manage security in their domains, especially through the establishment of a state policing system and developing their own internal security arrangements.\n\nThey said: \u201cIn the interim, Mr. President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr. President and all state governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that the police force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Northern Governors\u2019 Forum and recently by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to states; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the six-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors enjoined all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and other cleavages.\n\nTambuwal said the meeting called on the \u201cincompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\nHe added that the meeting reiterated the earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\n\nThe PDP governors thanked their host and colleague in Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmarks developmental projects he has executed.\n\nThey urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South-west to ensure that PDP takes over the majority of the states in the zone.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were Tambuwal; Governors Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State; Douye Diri of Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Seyi Makinde Oyo State; Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State; Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Mohammed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "North-west may clinch top post\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale\n\nIn an impending major realignment in the Senate, senators have started consultations on a possible leadership change that could see President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, shoved out of office, THISDAY learnt last night.\n\nA member of the House of Representatives, representing Esan North-east/Esan South-east Federal Constituency of Edo State, Hon. Sergius Ogun, had while featuring on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said plans were being made for the removal of Lawan.\n\nHe stated that Lawan might be sacked this week due to the way he chastised Southern governors over their resolutions at their last week\u2019s meeting in Asaba during which they canvassed a national dialogue and ban on open grazing of cattle, among others.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of reviewing the constitution and the chairman of the National Assembly (Lawan) is rebuking, chastising the governors for saying that they should restructure the country. So, if you ask me, any right-thinking person will believe that the process is dead on arrival. He doesn\u2019t believe in it; why would he talk like that?\n\n\u201cFor him really to be talking to governors representing a section of the country like that, he\u2019s not fit to be the Senate president and I strongly believe that the senators from the South will do something about it this week.\u201d\n\nOgun said the country did not need people that could express their bias in that manner.\n\nHe wondered why a leader who was supposed to be bringing people together could be speaking in such a way.\n\n\u201cWe are even talking about impeachment? Who is the leader? The Chairman of the National Assembly. If we are going to start any process of impeachment of the president, who is going to superintend over that? The same man we are talking about. I think he should go and I am sure the process has started.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Southern senators have started collating the signatures, the lawmaker said he knew that senators were already thinking along that line.\n\nHe, however, added that he was not sure if they would have enough signatures to take him out.\n\nTHISDAY, however, got more details of the plot last night as North-west senators are said to be mobilizing their colleagues from the North-central even as they have rest assured of the Peoples Democratic Party-dominated Southern caucus for an onslaught on Lawan.\n\nAlthough the reasons for the putsch are still hazy, some insiders told THISDAY that senators had complained about Lawan\u2019s tight-fistedness, accusing him of refusing to release funds for their work.\n\nAccording to them, committee works have almost been grounded as a result of Lawan\u2019s sluggish approval process, pointing out that senators were struggling financially.\n\nAdded to this, added a source, is the growing embarrassment Lawan\u2019s unbridled support for President Muhammadu Buhari is causing the senators. Efforts to get him to be more circumspect, THISDAY, learnt has been unfruitful.\n\nThe last straw that broke the Camel\u2019s back, according to another THISDAY source, was his last week\u2019s diatribe against Southern governors\u2019 demand for restructuring among others.\n\n\u201cMany senators, particularly from the South, thought that was unbecoming of the head of another arm of government,\u201d he said, pointing out that not a few of them felt that Lawan had crossed the line.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that if Lawan is shoved aside, the site may move to the North-west zone, which has the highest number of senators.\n\nThis current maneuver threatens to obstruct the stability of the upper chamber procured by former Senate President David Mark and maintained by Senator Bukola Saraki.\n\nThe putsch may also worry Buhari, who with Lawan in the saddle, had the Senate in his pocket.\n\nEfforts to speak to the spokesman of the Senate, Senator Ajibola Basiru, were unsuccessful as calls to his mobile phone did not connect.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has said that the decision to ban open grazing is in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nThe forum however warned that merely banning open grazing will not end the challenges as a large population of violent herders come from neighbouring countries.\n\nIn a statement on Monday in Kaduna, Chairman of the forum and former minister of agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbe said, \u201cThe ACF does not see any reason to object to a decision taken in the best interest of all.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the crisis emanates from the belief by most herdsmen that they are free to enter any farm, eat up the crops and rape or kill any one raising objections. Nobody or society can accept that.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the current high price of garri is one obvious reason of this behaviour.\n\n\u201cFew cassava farms can grow to maturity or be harvested by the farmers. So food security is already being threatened\u201d, the statement said.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is, however, the need to advise the governor\u2019s in all states not to think that merely banning open grazing will end the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the violent herders are the ones marching in from neighboring African countries in large numbers, thousands at a time and showing no regards to boundaries whether State or regional. They have to be stopped.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Ganduje formula must be adopted to stop the entry into Nigeria of cattle from West Africa\u201d, Ogbe said.\n\nHe said the solution is for Nigeria to seek an amendment to article 3 of the ECOWAS Protocols, especially, as regards to free movement of cattle and other livestock without special permits.\n\nOgbe said, \u201cIf this is done, we have over 5million hectatres of land in old grazing reserves left, enough to accommodate over 40 million cows if well grassed and watered.\n\nHe called on Northern governors to immediately look into this and see the viability, stressing that within those spaces, ranches can be developed for lease to Nigerian herders as an end to the crisis.\n\n\u201cThereafter any herders found roaming can be penalized. Our ECOWAS neighbours can find ways to deal with their own issues the way they seem fit.\n\n\u201cWe can seek support from AfFB, the World Bank, EU or the Kuwait Fund or any source willing to support us in resolving this problem.\n\n\u201cHurling abuses, trading suspicion and threatening warfare as is currently the trend will only produce grief and disaster\u201d, the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Missing results look like a normal thing, and when it happens, students are usually the ones who bear the brunt by paying for an extra year and re-registering for the course if such a student is still in the final year.\n\n\u201cAyomide who was a spill-over student didn't only die as a result of a motorcycle accident while running helter-skelter to make sure he was cleared and mobilised for the next batch for the mandatory youth service. He had been traumatised for a very long time due to accumulated stress and pressure from his family who kept incurring the cost of his travel expenses from Ibadan, Oyo State to Ipetu, Osun State and back.\n\n\"A university is a citadel of learning, not a community of sadists who would be asking for just too much from young individuals who have only come to seek knowledge,\u201d the student said.",

          "title": "Ahmed Lawan's deep state and the dangers of postponing the evil day",
          "text": "BY PAUL OBI\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor to employ the coercive apparatus of the state in order to maintain manifestly unjust institutions is itself a form of illegitimate force that men in due course have a right to resist.\u201d \u2014 John Rawls\n\nSince 1999, Senate President Ahmed Laman has been on the radar of the political arena, titling to the hustle and bubbling of politics in Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja and home state of Yobe. He is also not new to Nigeria\u2019s current political dispensation. At the inception of democracy in 1999, Ahmed Lawan was elected a member of the house of representatives and later a senator in 2007. With degrees from the University of Maiduguri, Ahmedu Bello University and a PhD from Cranfield University, United Kingdom (UK), Lawan has all the requisite expertise and knowledge to stir the Nigerian ship to a coast of people-driven reforms and good governance.\n\nBut in the murky swamp that has come to define Nigeria\u2019s political elite culture in Abuja and across the states, the senate president is part of the swamp and deep state that has for years kept Nigeria on her knees. It was surprising therefore for Lawan to have somersaulted when he warned of the dire consequences of the Nigerian state ignoring the clamour by youths for change and failing to address the prevailing quagmire and degradation that has characterised our governance system. Surprising because, since his ascension to the office of the senate presidency, Lawan has left no one in doubt that he was passionately going to play ball with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government if even it was at cross purpose with public good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in many surprises and instances with the Lawan-led senate, the red chamber has sprung up some shock waves that contradict Lawan\u2019s initial stance \u2014 by confronting the executive headlong on salient issues of national importance, even to the consternation of many. Critically, Nigeria\u2019s present precarious situation is a product of the deliberate suffocation of the country by the ruling elites. Warp and all, the current elites cannot be exonerated in many facets of Nigeria\u2019s troubling crisis. While Lawan and his co-evals of the Independence Generation had the best opportunities, they have regrettably turned round to bequeath scorched-earth policies and a system that has left the Nigerian youths grasping for breath and survival.\n\nWorst still, within the last two decades of our democracy, there are no concrete efforts to address the Nigerian crisis squarely. Rather, our democracy has raised some of the ruling class to stupendous wealth and riches \u2014 whereby, through the lucre of public funds, some have become richer in properties than the Catholic Church. In the same swoop, Nigeria and its teeming populace have now become the poverty capital of the world as acknowledged by the United Nations (UN) and the country\u2019s own National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nBeyond the rhetorics of governing for the sake of public good, it has been a subtle romance with cosmetic measures orchestrated by the elite as a form of remedy. Hence, in interrogating Lawan\u2019s recent outburst and vexation, and warning about an impending upheaval if nothing is done to address these systemic and structural inadequacies with Nigeria\u2019s governance system, there\u2019s an urgency to go beyond the peripheral. Thus, when Lawan warned during the #EndSARS Protest in 2020 that \u201crecently, we had some of our youths protesting genuinely. So, our budget, especially in 2021, should be centred on what to do to provide employment opportunities for these youths\u2026 And for us, elected people, we are going to be accountable. If we escape this one (#EndSAR protest), the other one is inescapable. And I\u2019m sure people know what I am saying\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs germane and important as Lawan\u2019s intervention appears, it definitely did not and will not address the opaque crisis of leadership and jaundiced system fueled by the feeding bottle democracy Nigeria is practically operating at the moment. At its best, addressing the demands of #EndSARS Protest with handouts from the 2021 National Budget falls short of the desired goal, and leaves such intervention merely as window dressing.\n\nWhat ails Nigeria cannot be vanquished by allocation and estimate embedded in an annual budget. What ails Nigeria is the suffocation and strangulation of the federating units \u2013 states, fraudulent electoral system, criminal confiscation of public wealth by the elites and the deployment of state apparatus to hunt and harass innocent citizens as exemplified by the innocuous prosecution of #EndSARS Protesters. In all, the solutions to the afore-mentioned dissipating problems confronting Nigeria lies with the National Assembly \u2013 which Lawan chairs.\n\nRecently, the senate president shamelessly tongue-lashed southern governors forum for calling for restructuring. For those who are oblivious of the antics of Ahmad Laman: he is part of the deep state; benefitting where he did not sow anything. What is the contribution of Yobe State to Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)? How much does Yobe State contribute to Nigeria\u2019s overall Value-Added Tax(VAT) How much does Yobe where Lawan comes takes monthly from the Federation Account for doing nothing? Billions of course. So, are these the pervading enclaves and pillars of injustice that Lawan is afraid of being erased through restructuring? Or is he desirous of protecting and shielding such injustice with reckless abundance? For the records: Lawan is against restructuring and he\u2019s one of the elites deliberately blurring the meaning and essence of restructuring. He\u2019s against youths protesting \u2013 #EndSARS, against state Police, slow and unfriendly to amending the electoral act to usher in electronic voting system, afraid of fiscal federalism.\n\nSo, what then does Senate President Lawan wants? He wants a lopsided Nigerian system and structure. He is so much in love with the current feeding bottle democracy and injustice. He\u2019s a paddy to a system where the labourers are different from the reapers. But he does not think that this house of injustice will fall one day. What Lawan and his co-travellers should know is that Nigeria cannot continue like this; it is either Nigeria is restructured or face ceaseless agitations for self-determination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, each day, Kano and Katsina states destroy trucks of beer and alcohol drinks based on their practice of Sharia Law and turn round to collect monthly value added tax (VAT) from revenues derived from sales of beer and alcohol beverages from Cross River, Lagos, Ondo, Plateau, Anambra, Enugu and Abuja, the chances of agitation against injustices and fraudulent federal system will quadruple. For the many times, Zamfara State Governor will zoom off to Abuja with tones of Gold to sell to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Presidency, the spate of militancy in the Niger-Delta and south-west moves closer to an international conflict over resource control.\n\nFor the many times, an underfunded federal police is compelled to police a country of more than 200 million, the complexities of modern policing will become more entrenched, as crime becomes the new normal. For every time, bandits attack farmers in Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina, the embers of discontent among Nigerians in those states rises astronomically.\n\nFor the many times, Boko Haram insurgents terrorize, kill, kidnap citizens and destroy properties in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states in the midst of bogus defence budget running into billions of dollars, the fragile state of the Nigerian nation-state edges towards the precipice. So, long as Nigerian national assembly members continue to benefit as the highest paid lawmakers in the world with about $2.4 million per annum in a country where more than ten million children are out of school, dozens of malnourished Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and Alamjiri children died of hunger, the chances of a revolution been televised get closer.\n\nAgain, Ahmad Lawan is part of the larger problem Nigeria faces presently. With the clamour for restructuring and fiscal federalism, the National Assembly which he chairs has blatantly refused to quench the raging fire. He is more interested in protecting his fiefdom and empire. But it needs to be made clear to the likes of Lawan and his co-travellers within the Nigerian deep state: as the country edges towards the abyss, she has only two options; restructuring \u2013 fiscal federalism or every region goes her separate way. The south has made this clear without any equivocation and the Lawans of this world must heed that path peacefully without rancour, not lampooning Southern Governors Forum and proponents of a just system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn summation, Ahmad Lawan\u2019s should be held accountable if anything happens to Nigeria. With his lapdog legislative style, the senate president appears to have buried Nigeria\u2019s democracy. The essence of representative and parliamentary democracy is lost with Lawan. His desperation to be the senate president by all means was crafted with inordinate ambitions \u2013 to placate democracy and ruin legislative oversight, checks and balances. Those are the legacies of Senate President Ahmad Lawan: but the dangers of postponing the evil day will be too devastating for Nigeria. The ghost of restructuring stares Lawan and his likes in the face, such that, there\u2019s no other leeway to rescuing Nigeria than to embrace restructuring and fiscal federalism.\n\nObi is a journalist and political communication expert based in Abuja",

          "title": "Inside Klasha\u2019s mission to help 5,000 global retailers sell and ship to Africa",
          "text": "It\u2019s a Tuesday afternoon in the first week of May, on the eve of Klasha\u2019s public launch. Jessica Anuna is showing me a demo of a customer adding items to a cart in an online store, filling in billing details and paying through Klasha.\n\nA few seconds later, her phone beeps with an email notification that her demo order has been placed, with a receipt attached for proof.\n\nAnuna exudes the relief and excitement of a founder and CEO who has built an e-commerce payments product from scratch after nearly three years. Klasha is her solution for global merchants looking to serve Africa\u2019s increasingly digitally native consumers.\n\n\u201cWith Klasha, merchants would not have to open individual country stores. They can now make their existing global e-commerce stores Africa friendly,\u201d Anuna says.\n\nThe business case\n\nOpening individual country stores is a secondary headache. For merchants who want to sell in Africa, the first problem is setting up country-by-country payment connections.\n\nTo do this well, these merchants have to be present on the ground and do some dreary work, like managing currency conversions themselves.\n\nKlasha Checkout essentially absorbs all of that responsibility into one payment gateway. Hear Anuna explain how Klasha manages exchange rate fluctuations:\n\n\u201cAt the time the customer pays for the item, the exchange rate is locked in. That way, we are able to remit the equivalent value to the merchant. In the merchant\u2019s dashboard, they can opt to pay themselves out at different exchange rates.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to payments, Klasha\u2019s e-commerce feature includes a logistics service. This service is built to convince high-growth brands, doing above $20 million in gross merchandise value, that Africa is a destination to take seriously.\n\nHer pitch is that when a merchant sets up a Klasha Checkout option on their website, Africans will more readily purchase items in their local currencies. Ghanaians pay with mobile money. Kenyans pay with M-Pesa. Nigerians can pay with Naira bank cards.\n\nBundling logistics and payments\n\nAt the moment, Anuna says they have retailers from the US, UK, the Middle East, and some conversations are ongoing with retailers in Japan. Their focus is on retailers selling fast-moving consumer goods that are not perishable \u2013 clothes, shoes, bags and electronics.\n\nKlasha will make revenue by taking commissions on sales and offering subscriptions to merchants, especially for add-ons like analytics. In exchange, the startup helps merchants collect payments from and ship directly to African buyers\u2019 doorsteps in no more than 9 working days.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous promise, especially the logistics aspect. Klasha is primarily a payments company. To fulfil deliveries, they will be partnering with two different logistics companies; the first brings the merchant\u2019s goods into Africa while the second delivers to the customer\u2019s door. In Nigeria, Anuna says they are ready to deliver to every local government area.\n\nWhy is a young startup burdening itself with this complexity, knowing how poor road infrastructure in Nigeria hampers efficient logistics?\n\nAlthough she held back details of Klasha\u2019s logistics, Anuna is confident that the company can deliver on a dependable model, which won\u2019t make consumers pay higher prices than other payments and shipping options.\n\nShe\u2019s relying on her experience at Amazon, Net-a-Porter and Shopify, plus four years in China running a logistics business.\n\nJessica Anuna, founder and CEO of Klasha. Image credit: Klasha\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t built Klasha alone. A glass wall separates the room where we meet from an adjacent room where her developers are having a chat, their laptops displaying several lines of code in pink and other colours.\n\nThe sales team, led by Fumi Aoki, is in another room crouched over computers. Aoki joined recently from Senri, a sales automation startup. Other members of the 11-person Klasha team have Nigerian startup experience from places like OPay, Andela and Boomplay.\n\nShooting for 5,000 Klasha merchants\n\nI wonder if Klasha can go on to integrate emerging fintech offerings \u2013 like Buy Now Pay Later. Anuna says her team has discussed it, but it is not on their short-term roadmap.\n\nAt the same time, she tries to sell me on the Klasha mobile app. The app enables users to generate virtual cards & shop on online stores regardless of whether the store has Klasha Checkout or not.\n\nKlasha\u2019s virtual card carries VISA\u2019s emblem and allows users to spend beyond the $100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The other distinct feature of the mobile app is sending money to peers using Twitter-like handles, which reminds me of Abeg, the peer-to-peer payments startup owned by Piggyvest.\n\nKlasha is in the virtual cards business. Goodbye $100 limits?\n\nAfter an hour-long conversation, I leave Anuna and her team to continue launch preparations. At least one influencer was drafted for publicity on D-Day; to drive app downloads.\n\nBut that will not be the metric to assess Klasha in three, six, or nine months. Instead, look out for how many major online stores and marketplaces Anuna has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have 5,000 merchants by Q1 2022,\u201d she says.\n\nHow many do they have right now? \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but we are on track.\u201d",

          "text": "I\u2019m bringing Feranmi Ajetomobi to Centre Stage because I admire how he expertly combines analytical thinking and empathetic storytelling to help Cowrywise achieve its goals. He certainly has a unique approach to growth and leadership\u2013 an approach that is useful to aspiring product marketers.\n\n\u201cSo, what does the day-to-day of a product marketing lead look like?\u201d\n\nMy conversation with Feranmi Ajetomobi begins with this seemingly simple question. In the background, coffee cups clink, plates rattle, and waiters call out orders in strained voices.\n\nFeranmi leads product marketing at Cowrywise; a wealthtech and personal finance startup founded by Razaq Ahmed and Edward Popoola in 2017.\n\nFeranmi: If you asked me this question two years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have known how to answer. [laughs].\n\n\u201cWhat has changed since then\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I started off in Cowrywise as a social media handler. Then I moved on to become the Brand Storyteller before settling into my current role as Product Marketing Manager.\n\n\u201cHave you always been about growth and numbers? How did you transition from being a social media handler to product marketing?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: From the get-go, I had always been focused on ensuring that whatever we did positively impacted our bottom line. I\u2019m interested in engaging customers and keeping them connected to our brand. An engaged customer will always spread the word about your product.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to running campaigns, what should people in your field keep in mind?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: [laughs] This is a dicey question because campaigns have different objectives depending on the marketing team\u2019s goals. But I\u2019ll stress the importance of keeping what you want to measure in front of you. It doesn\u2019t make sense to run one campaign with multiple goals at the same time. I recommend starting with one goal and working to tie it to the bottom line. A bonus answer is: implement fast.\n\nI might need to re-think the number of goals I added to a campaign document I worked on last week.\n\nFeranmi: You definitely should. The truth is, focusing on one goal allows you to under-promise and over-deliver.\n\nCustomers love when brands exceed their expectations. You cannot exceed a customer\u2019s expectations if you are juggling too many goals.\n\nFeranmi: Exactly. One goal keeps your customers excited about what you are building to meet their needs.\n\nStudying Economics, writing classes, and a toolbox full of skills\n\n\u201cWhat skills did you already have in your toolbox and how did they help you become successful at your role in Cowrywise\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I took creative writing and poetry classes when I was in primary school. Interestingly enough, I grew up wanting to be a doctor but ended up studying economics at university.\n\n\u201cSay, what?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: [laughs] It\u2019s a long story that involves writing JAMB, applying for pharmacology, not getting in, re-writing JAMB, dropping out of some pre-med courses because of a problematic lecturer and re-routing to economics.\n\nStudying economics helped me think analytically about numbers and growth. My writing and comprehension skills enable me to break down complicated financial jargon into easy-to-understand articles.\n\n\u201cFascinating. What skills have you learned on the job\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Learning how to write emails in HTML and deepening my understanding on website and product analytics.\n\nThe subtle art of asking questions, listening and paying attention to small details\n\n\u201cWhat motivates you to stick with a company\u201d\n\nFeranmi: A strong and supportive team is a big motivator for me. Not a lot of founders will risk hiring someone who doesn\u2019t have a suite of impressive skills from the jump. Cowrywise is a space where I can learn and grow within my role and the company. I\u2019m also motivated by the company\u2019s vision. Cowrywise is interested in providing investment and wealth creation opportunities to Africans wherever they are in the world.\n\n\u201cWhat would you say to aspiring product marketing professionals\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Successful product marketing managers must have sharp social listening skills. You need to be able to gather information about how people interact with your products and brand. Next, you need to be intelligent about the way you see and address your competition.\n\n\u201cWhat makes someone a great leader?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I don\u2019t send angry emails during a heated moment. I may write my thoughts out and save them in my drafts, but I\u2019m unlikely to send angry emails to my team members. I ask questions before I make assumptions about delayed work or missed deadlines. Being a good listener is a non-negotiable leadership skill. Listen and pay attention to your team members\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. Where do your team members like to eat? Can you tell when they are having a bad day? How quick are you to offer them support? Ask questions, listen, and pay attention to the little details.\n\nWomen, financial exclusion, and the future of wealthtech\n\n\u201cWhat have you discovered about financial exclusion where women are concerned?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Firstly, let me say that financial businesses that aren\u2019t chasing the inclusion of women are sleeping on a horse. Secondly, a lot of Nigerian women are victims of financial abuse in their own homes. Women who live in rural areas can\u2019t even access the money they earn from working petty jobs. Finally, the road to accessing credit in the informal sector is a long and bumpy one; particularly for women.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of recommendations would you make to conventional banking executives\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Most of these women have feature phones but they aren\u2019t literate enough to navigate USSD prompts. I recommend that banks and financial institutions use robocalls to communicate with women in rural communities. They can take it a step further by providing instructions on how to access credit in their local languages or dialect.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is the future of wealthtech in Africa? What do you think is possible\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I wake up every day thinking about endless possibilities in this industry. Wealthtech companies are going to help future billionaires grow their money. There\u2019s a common myth that wealthtech products help people make money \u2013 that\u2019s not what we do. We help you grow the money you make, legally. Adoption is moving at a snail pace but with consistent financial education, we\u2019re going to see more Africans gravitate towards wealth management services. I\u2019m hoping that more Nigerian wealthtech companies will invest in creating resources and content to promote financial wellness.",

          "text": "\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t come out right, they blame the editors.\u201d\n\nChuks Oteke had had enough of the complaints about his work. In 2012, he set up his video production studio where he provided visual effects and video editing services, but every now and then he received complaints from clients who were dissatisfied with his work. To them, Oteke was the problem but to him, the problem was the raw video cuts he got from his clients.\n\nThe shots taken on set didn\u2019t really tell the story and the clients believed that any shortcoming could be fixed in post-production.\n\nWhen he couldn\u2019t take it anymore he decided to look into why the shots were poor. He took on different camera operator jobs on different video shoot sets. At the end of his research, he came to the conclusion that the camera operators didn\u2019t have the right tools to get the right shots.\n\n\u201cTo tell a good story, it\u2019s not just about the camera. You need to position the lighting right, you also need to frame the shots appropriately. If a character is feeling depressed, the camera angle should help depict depression. High angles help with this by making the actor seem small or overwhelmed. On the contrary, a low angle helps in depicting joy or happiness,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some cases, a crane is needed to achieve these shots but how many people can afford it?\n\nThis informed his decision to go into creating tools for shooting videos. He started with making prototypes of DIY tools. It didn\u2019t officially become a business until some people offered to pay him for the tools.\n\n\u201cSo I started making noise on Instagram and Facebook about how I make customised DIY tools and the response was good. It got to a point where there was so much demand I just couldn\u2019t meet up with it.\u201d\n\nThis birthed Film Anatomie, one of the few African companies designing and manufacturing filming equipment. It caters for a wide range of clients such as independent content creators, filmmakers, television studios and even equipment rental companies.\n\nA component of the slider created by Film Anatomie\n\nGetting into General Electric (GE) Garage\n\nHigh demand could have fooled someone else to think they were in business but not Oteke. He quickly realised that he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable enough to turn his interest into a business so he enrolled in the General Electric (GE) Garage Program in 2014. During the training program, which spanned across a few years, his mind was opened to advanced manufacturing techniques, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc.\n\nHe remarked that simply learning about product design influenced the design of his products.\n\nDuring the program, Oteke met other participants who were into robotics, aviation, STEM education and biomedicine.\n\nAt the end, he had access to over a thousand local and foreign mentors in the tech space.\n\n\u201cI now had this network of people I can contact at any time and say, \u2018I have this problem, how can I solve it?\u2019 Definitely, there\u2019ll be somebody who knows somebody else who can help.\u201d\n\nDifficulty in getting funding\n\nArmed with this knowledge and network, he set out to run a better business. He knew where and how to get raw materials. It wasn\u2019t possible to make everything locally but with 80% local raw materials the cost of production was low.\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle was finance. He needed a business partner as well as capital.\n\n\u201cI am a techie. I\u2019m not a business person. So I was looking for investors who\u2019d provide capital and also business advice. It took a while for me; other participants had already gotten investments.\u201d\n\nGraduates of the GE Garage Program were introduced to a pool of investors in their fields. While many of the other participants had business ideas that were seen as important, Oteke\u2019s idea was seen as a nice-to-have. Investors showed little to no interest in him until the movie Lionheart was released.\n\nHow Lionheart changed everything\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know Genevieve, I\u2019ve never met her, but she doesn\u2019t know what she has done for me.\u201d\n\nGenevieve Nnaji\u2019s Lionheart made headlines in 2018 for its milestone as a pioneering Nigerian Netflix original. Finally, investors started paying attention to the creative industry. Oteke started getting some attention.\n\nIn an industry that barely has ready data, Oteke had to crowdsource and develop a realistic projection for his business. He found out that the Nigerian movie industry produces about 50 movies per week and generates an impressive $590million in revenue annually.\n\nHis pitch to investors was simple: the filming industry market is smaller than it will be in a few years time, it\u2019s easier to gain a large market share now.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s creative industry doesn\u2019t have a repository but with Netflix you could see the views and how much was being paid. Lionheart was reportedly bought for $3.8m.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, while it was easier to get overall industry statistics, he still had issues getting numbers because his target audience are moviemakers, not actors. He reached out to different production teams to get a sense of how much they spent on equipment and what the demand was like.\n\n\u201cI reached out to friends in film production and film schools. I established a relationship with Dell York, Jeta Amata and Olu Jacobs\u2019 film school. I\u2019m trying to establish one with Ebony life. We hope to grow to the point where you can come to us when you need the numbers for Africa\u2019s creative industry.\u201d\n\nA member of Film Anatomie working on a new product\n\nGetting Investment\n\nAfter one of Oteke\u2019s pitches at GE garage, an investor from Platform capital* reached out to him. The conversation, unlike others, looked promising.\n\n\u201cI remember I told him \u2018I\u2019m not really much of a business person, and I know you can help. You also have access to other markets like Asia, America and the UK\u2019. He was quite open and he wanted to build a film academy, a production company, and [had] a lot of other creative ideas.\u201d\n\nOteke finally got investment just before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made it difficult to get a few necessary things but was also a blessing because at that time they pivoted to making face masks with their 3D printers. It was a business opportunity that kept the lights on for a while before they returned back to their main focus: creating film equipment.\n\nA sample of the Face Mask made with 3D printer\n\nOteke and some team members at work\n\nOffering free products to get customers\n\nAs the effects of the pandemic waned and filming activities began, Oteke and his team were tasked with finding customers. Unlike other popular filming equipment, people were hesitant towards trusting their expensive cameras and filming gadgets with less popular locally made equipment. Building trust was the next hurdle they had to jump.\n\n\u201cWe found a way to mitigate that problem by offering our products for free. We targeted selected customers who could help us publicize our brand. For instance, I took my slider to where some big filmmakers were filming. I let them use my own on one camera while they use their own slider on the main camera. At the end of the shoot, I\u2019d ask them \u2018what do you think I can do to make this tool better?\u2019 They\u2019d tell me and we\u2019d make the adjustments.\u201d\n\nA number of them were often satisfied, when they asked for the price, the price difference made Film Anatomie\u2019s products more appealing. His sliders cost about \u20a6100,000 (~$220) while the existing more popular sliders with the same features are more expensive, costing between $500 \u2013 $1,000.\n\nOteke discussing with a team member, while making reference to a 3D computer-aided design\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nOteke might have started making equipment for the film industry but at the heart of what he does is manufacturing where there\u2019s a need. The goal for him is to manufacture for other sectors like 3D printing for car parts and household materials.\n\nA 3D printer built by Chuks Oteke. He built it using some parts created by the first 3D printer he bought.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, we don\u2019t make anything, we just consume. There has been some success in the fintech space and agricultural space, but in the hardware manufacturing space we still worship China.\u201d\n\nHe believes the future is in designing and manufacturing in Africa.\n\nOteke\u2019s big project for the year is an electric vehicle that would be used for site inspections in real estate and for video shoots. The car would be able to ride on regular roads and on rough terrains.\n\nA 3D computer-aided design of the electric car\n\nThe frame of the electric car in the workshop\n\nFor Oteke and his team at Film Anatomie, the vision to create homegrown solutions is massive. They\u2019re focused on building and collaborating with others thinking in the same line.\n\n*Platform Capital is an investor in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nGovernor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has suspended his Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Special Duties, Abidemi Rufai, following his arrest in New York by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over alleged involvement in $.350 million Covid-19 unemployment benefits fraud.\n\nThe governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, who announced the decision, said the news of his aide\u2019s involvement in fraud is disturbing.\n\nHe emphasized, however, that the \u201cGovernor cannot be held responsible for the actions of a full grown adult.\u201d\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe received the very disturbing news of the arrest of one of the governor\u2019s political appointees, Mr Abidemi Rufai in New York over alleged unemployment benefits and fraud in the United States, this morning.\n\n\u201cWhile the Governor cannot be held responsible for the actions of a full grown adult, especially outside the jurisdiction of Ogun and Nigeria, he has since suspended the suspect from office to enable him answer the charges levelled against him.\n\n\u201cThe Governor wishes to condemn any act capable of undermining his determination to institute an open, transparent, accountable and morally upright behaviour in the State and in governance.\n\n\u201cGov. Abiodun remains committed to his agenda of building our future together and will not condone criminals either in his government or the state in general.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice arrested Abidemi Rufai, Refai over the alleged scam.\n\nThis was contained in a statement titled: \u2018Nigerian citizen charged with defrauding Washington State Employment Security Department of over $350,000\u2019 by the Department\u201d on Monday.\n\nAccording to the statement, Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman announced Rufai was arrested Friday evening at JFK Airport in New York on a criminal complaint charging him with wire fraud \u201cfor his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department.\u201d\n\nThe statement disclosed that Rufai who allegedly disguised as \u2018Sandy Tang\u2019 made his initial appearance on Saturday in New York.\n\nHe is scheduled for a detention hearing Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSince the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief.\n\n\u201cThis is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of ESD fraud,\u201d Gorman was quoted to have said in the statement.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleged he used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cRufai also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cRufai used variations of a single e-mail address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\n\u201cBy using this practice, Rufai made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\n\u201cRufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as \u2018Green Dot\u2019 accounts, or wired to bank accounts controlled by \u2018money mules.\u2019\n\n\u201cSome of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai\u2019s relative.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement determined more than $288,000 was deposited into an American bank account controlled by Rufai between March and August 2020.\n\n\u201cGreed is a powerful motivator. Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and our partners will not stand idly by while individuals attempt to defraud programs meant to assist American workers and families suffering the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d said Donald Voiret, Special Agent in Charge FBI Seattle.\n\nWire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison when it relates to benefits paid in connection with a presidentially-declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt was established that the charges contained in the complaint are only allegations as a person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe case was reportedly investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG).\n\n\u201cThe fraud on ESD is being investigated cooperatively by the FBI, DOL-OIG, Social Security Office of Inspector General, U.S. Secret Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations.\n\n\u201cThe Washington Employment Security Department is cooperating in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe cases are being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson, Cindy Chang, and Benjamin Diggs of the Western District of Washington, and Trial Attorney Jane Lee of DOJ\u2019s Cyber Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS),\u201d the statement concluded",

The import of this approval is that any cultural property that is 250 years or older can never enter the\n\nUnited States of America from Nigeria, unless with the official imprimatur of Nigeria,\u201d he said, adding that such antiquities will be returned to Nigeria from the US border without the need for expensive litigations or diplomatic shuttles.\n\nOn the home front, Alhaji Mohammed said in order to forestall further theft of the country\u2019s antiquities and other heritage properties and to enthrone better management in this field, \u201dwe are placing the law pertaining to this sector before the National Assembly. We know they will give it every support and ensure its expeditious passage.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the theme for this year\u2019s International Museum Day, which is \u2018The Future of Museums: Recover and Imagine\u2019, he said the theme has its background in the changes the world has experienced in the past year because of the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201dWe hope the expected full recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic will be the harbinger of a reimagining that will enable us to leverage on the areas in which we have comparative advantage \u2013 our arts and our culture \u2013 in order to re-launch ourselves to the world,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nThe International Museum Day is celebrated on May 18 every year to bring knowledge and information about museums to the people and to introduce museums to the communities.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Dami Duro to FEM: Analysing Davido\u2019s 10 years of making smashing hits back to back",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nTen years ago, an 18-year-old stormed the Nigerian music industry with \u2018Back When\u2019 and \u2018Dami Duro\u2019 tracks that swept across Africa.\n\nFor many, it seemed like the regular case of a new artiste hitting luck in quick succession. But for those who had known the teenage sensation, this was the birth of a new star.\n\nThe first track, \u201cBack When\u201d was a faux attempt to explore a struggle narrative. But fortunately, David Adeleke redirected his narrative and embraced his privileged status with Dami Duro.\n\nAnd \u201cDami Duro\u201d, co-produced by Shizzi, was the perfect introduction to Davido. As one from an affluent family, his background afforded him the leeway to pursue music as a hobbie, but with Dami Duro, Davido stood in our faces, shouting at the top of his lungs \u201cI am from a rich family, I own my representation and no one can stop me\u201d\n\n10 years on, and Davido has walked the talk. He has had an enviable career laden with multiple hit tracks and lots of real awards to brag with.\n\nDavido\u2019s story is one that deserves to be told and this week, NewsWireNGR had a chat with Obinna Agwu, a music executive and talent manager to analyse Davido\u2019s success and detail how his career has been a win for the Afrobeats community.\n\nWhat is the Afrobeat genre?\n\nThere\u2019s Afrobeat and there\u2019s Afrobeats. Afrobeat without the \u2018S\u2019 is the music that Fela worked tirelessly to develop over a long period. From his own band Koola Lobitos to finally refining it to where he started Egypt 80 and everything, and it was because he schooled out there in the West, he took in a lot of their sound and all of that. But at some point, Fela felt the need to really stand apart from the music he had learnt and he wanted to make it more African than more make it more authentic.\n\nSo Afrobeat is the music today that emerged from the genius who spent tireless time in developing and working on it in the 60s.\n\nSo now to the Afrobeats with the \u2018S\u2019. A lot of people are going to say to you that unlike Afrobeat that is a distinct sound with elements, Afrobeats music isn\u2019t particularly a genre. It is just the overarching umbrella sound of the music out of West Africa.\n\nAnother funny thing is that the word Afrobeat was first coined or used by a Ghanaian-based DJ in the UK called DJ Atlantic. He was on radio at a time, and he had a show on a certain radio station and at that point he introduced a lot of African music. I guess after some time he felt the need to call it something, so that\u2019s where Afrobeat came from. Afrobeat is pretty much a sound from West Africa, the overarching sound of the umbrella music from West Africa.\n\nAfrobeats looks like the biggest export from Africa to the world right now, can give us a rundown of the evolution of the genre?\n\nWhen you talk about Afrobeats music, there are a lot of elements and a lot of people to thank. For example In 2005, people like MTV Base made their entry into Nigeria and to Africa. What those platforms did was that they gave us an avenue to expose our music to a bigger and wider audience within Africa and the world.\n\nHowever, at that time what we know as Afrobeats hasn\u2019t quite started to happen so at that time We had the 9ice, we had the P-Square, Naeto C, Ikechukwu, Mo\u2019 Hits, MI and all these people things, so as our music continued to grow I would say it was in early 2010 that Afrobeat started to form and shape up into something, especially with people like Wizkid, and there\u2019s really no way we would talk about Afrobeat victory without bringing the UK into it.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately because the UK ended up playing a huge role that helped in disseminating the sound support, and it was very obvious because we have a lot of Nigerians out there, a lot of Africans out there. So the UK is really much like an annex of Africa, so the UK and the regions of the UK and the people of the UK definitely played the huge role in helping to disseminate the sound support just like in everything, as you start to earn success, more people want to tap in, more people want to understand what you\u2019re doing. So before we knew it people like Drake came in and wanted to do stuff, J Hus plenty people, Skepta, so many people started to identify with the sound and these people came with their own huge following and their own audience. I\u2019d say that Afrobeat as a sound or as a musical consciousness , pretty much started in the 2010s and yes, we are like ten years deep into all of that now. So shout-out to Davido, shout out to Wizkid , shout to all these people who helped to push the sounds up.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Afrobeats rise without mentioning Davido, a man who recently clocks a decade in the industry. What do you think has defined his career so far in the industry?\n\nResilience and Passion. At the initial stage a lot of people did not consider David to be the most obviously talented person.\n\nBut one thing you could tell from David was that this kid was hungry, this kid wanted this thing, this Kid is going to do anything to get it , as God would have it he seems to have financial support on his path, but why I would not talk so much about that is that before David and even after David, we have seen a lot of rich kid , right? So money is not the only reason David is such a star. As a manager and an administrator, I have run with people who have money but their money is for their lifestyle and it\u2019s not for the music and when it\u2019s time to invest in music they would not, but with David , David realised that okay, I have the wherewithal to do what I need to do, he really put his money where his mouth is and he went all out for it.\n\nSo I would say resilience and passion first of all and over time we have seen this guy improve and get better and better. So it\u2019s not hard to say that David has been growing because over time he has shown us that.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Davido has undergone a lot of evolution to stay relevant. What has been the biggest?\n\nFor me, his biggest evolution has been his ability to spot great songs. His ability to work with amazingly gifted people and you must understand that sometimes these people are not necessarily the most affordable people to work it but David has displayed creative maturity over time.\n\nIn Nigeria a lot of people at his level wouldn\u2019t be open to come and say \u2018somebody wrote this song with me, or I took the song from somebody\u2019. But, we have seen David do that from time to time . From \u2018Gobe\u2019 to T Spize that wrote \u2018Aye\u2019 to collaborating with Peruzzi on a lot of songs, to working with Adekunle Gold on One Milli , so you can tell that David has a mentality that a lot of his peers and people do not have.\n\nHe is open , he understands music, he goes to a place and hears a song and says Yo, this song, I want this song, I need to sing this song, I would buy this song off you, what is it going to take , so over time David has shown that he is an incredible Musician and he has the ear for good music and also likes working with with gifted people.\n\nA lot of people say his special sauce is creating monster hits, how true is this? And how easy is it?\n\nHis special sauce is recognising monster hit, so when somebody tries to downplay David\u2019s greatness and say he is not talented, I\u2019m like yoo, it takes a lot of talent to spot hit, it was this boy who spotted \u2018Gobe\u2019 and he bought it, this guy who spotted \u2018Aye\u2019, and he bought it, he spotted even \u2018Fem\u2019.\n\nHe said some people were working at his studio, the song was not even meant for him, he now pulled up, he heard it and he was like yoo I\u2019m using this work, it takes talent to be able to spot those things you know and the ability to collaborate with very gifted people, all these things are talent, these are things his father\u2019s money cannot afford him. So yeah, Davido definitely has superpower for creating songs that are amazing.\n\n\u2018IF\u2019 was written by Tekno so you can tell that this guy is actually steps ahead of his peers. He is able to collaborate with the right people and he is able to spot amazing songs and say so you know what we are going to do with this one.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference in delivery even when one buy songs\n\nDefinitely, and he does that well. Like \u2018Gobe\u2019, he ended up not using the actual beat and he got.bI think he got Chizzi, and David has done so many things like this with his songs. So you can tell that this guy really has something, he knows something, something that can\u2019t just be learnt, something his father\u2019s money can\u2019t buy.\n\nWhat other elements of music marketing has Davido mastered to keep him going for over ten years?\n\nI think his use of social media has been very impressive over the years and that\u2019s why If I am not mistaken I think he even has more followers than Wizkid on Instagram.\n\nThat says a lot because Wizkid is quite a superstar. But for some reason, that followers count means that more people are trying to see something on David\u2019s side than on Wiz\u2019s side and it\u2019s just that when people love you and they admire you , they want to know more about you and David let\u2019s you in. You see his friends, you see his travels, you see his kids and even when he\u2019s ranting he puts it up there and another thing, David is so giving off his platform, that\u2019s something we have seen over time, I\u2019ve seen and then when he sees something that\u2019s amazing, he is always making sure he finds a way behind it through his platform I think in some way these things get to people and they love you more and support you.\n\nAlso, David is actually a businessman and he is very clinical about these things. If you get on YouTube and say you want to sit down and watch David\u2019s videos, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time there. And you know that these videos are shot by Clarence Peters. If you put it into naira and kobo, you would see that we are talking about hundreds of millions so a lot of people make money and they struggle putting that money back into their business but not David.\n\nHe\u2019s a great businessman and his use of social media has been very impressive and he has a heart of working with the right people.\n\nA lot of people have pointed at his humility in recalling Asa, as a key moment in his career\n\nYou see what he displayed, these are the things people love about David. David\u2019s ability to be honest and to just come out of a situation and say this is what it is.\n\nLike the project he did with Sony, that international project, David would openly say to you, I don\u2019t like that project, that project carries my name but I do not like it, I don\u2019t think it was me, I don\u2019t think I was allowed to do what I really wanted to do. It\u2019s not a lot of artistes who are able to look at their work and say ohhh I do not like this work .\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big level of honesty and sincerity and I think people can really connect with that. And on a human level when you have that type of understanding, it puts you in a place where you can learn and get better.\n\nTo Asa, I happen to be there to some extent. Asa started out working for his uncle\u2019s record company, Storm records, and of course you know Storm records at the time in Nigeria were like the biggest record label Nigeria. So that gave him a platform, that gave him access to do a lot of things and meet a lot of people. So I remember there was a time when Asa was hosting club nights in a lot of big clubs or Storm was handling PR for a lot of big clubs and it was him who would directly manage that relationship. So overtime, this guy had a strong contact base and I saw him first hand deploy all of this to push his music forward.\n\nAnd David is very clinical in his actions. He knows what he wants to do and he goes for it. We talked about \u201cBack When\u201d, do you know that he paid Naeto C for that feature? One would think that because Asa is his little cousin things would come easily, no, that feature was paid for and it was business, at that point how many people were paid? I think he paid about a million naira for him to do the audio and then be on the video. The video was shot by Clarence Peters, and over time we have seen how many more Clarence Peters videos he has made. Meaning that he wants the quality of the work to be good every step of his way .\n\nI can\u2019t say how the disagreement happened, but these things happen, at some point they fell in and then Kamal came in and a lot of things. But it takes a lot of honesty and sincerity for you to look at something and say, I should go back to this guy, this really loves me and was out for my best interest and he did just that.\n\nAnd from a manager\u2019s point of view, that was for me a key moment in the industry because I don\u2019t remember seeing stuff like that happen a lot of times. When an artiste falls out with his manager, and they go back to do their thing and honestly say \u2018you\u2019re the person who can do this thing, I\u2019m sorry about everything, let us just keep going\u2019. I strongly believe that as we celebrate David we ought to celebrate Asa as well.\n\nA lot of people think 2016 was Davido\u2019s biggest moment. I saw a video on twitter and it was a thread of different renowned celebrities singing those 2016 fire songs, FIA, IF and Fall. There was even a Kanye West sample. How did David crack the international scene with those songs?\n\nLike I said, David is very passionate, very driven, when he feels like it\u2019s time to get things done, he goes out to get it. Yes, he was already shutting things down on the Africa front, but that \u2018IF\u2019 victory was a calculated promo plan on their path.\n\nI\u2019m sure he must have sent them back some decent dollars to some announcers in American and possibly gotten some help with the international labels he was in at that time. This was someone basically saying I think it\u2019s about time we get this thing done and he went all out and then made it happen. It took some time but eventually the figures and everything started to add up. That was another coordinated plan by David and his team.\n\nDavido has amassed over a billion streams so far and I think that\u2019s very rich, how critical is digital streaming to the growth of Afrobeats?\n\nVery critical, and it is not like we have a choice because digital streaming is where the parties are right now. There\u2019s nobody who is trying to engage with your physical products anymore and there\u2019s nobody trying to buy your VHS or anything.\n\nSo it\u2019s not like we have a choice but it\u2019s a good thing people think that we were deemed enough to engage in those platforms and we woke up to the right technology and partnership of technology early enough. Imagine that we made all these things happen without our own numbers being registered on platforms like Spotify. Spotify just only came to Nigeria this year. So it just shows that despite all the numbers you have been seeing on Spotify, Nigerians in Nigeria our numbers are not even there.\n\nIt just shows how much better these things are going to be, and we have Audiomack, we have YouTube, we have Apple music, we have Spotify these brands have also realised that we Nigerians are an important market. And shout out to Nigerians in diaspora, they continue to push the culture forward. I like to think that they are the unsung heroes of Afrobeats music, because Nigerians everywhere and we can make music everywhere. Maybe that\u2019s the advantage we have over other countries because of the chances that you\u2019re going to find Nigerians everywhere. We are always travelling so It\u2019s easy for our music to travel as well. Hopefully, the internet data can get cheaper and more people can be able to access smart phones and all these gadgets and then stream it down and more people can be able to jam in and help grow this ecosystem.\n\nBurnaboy and Wizkid, recently bagged the grammy awards, will Davido get one soon?\n\nI think David is very close to it, because away from the music, the Grammy sometimes can tend to be like a popularity contest sometimes and, David is quite high up there and more than anything this dude has shown us that he has the ability to continue to bag out this heat. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any stopping that soon. This guy is not even 30 years old yet so David definitely has a lot of time on his clock to go out there and make it happen. He has the pedigree, he has the connections, he has the finance, he has everything, and ultimately he has music.\n\nI like to think eventually, David is going to be on his stage, hold his neck and say \u2018E choke\u2019 at some point.\n\nIn a recent interview with Ebuka, Davido said stuff like, Grammy no be by force. Do you think he can be as intentional as Burna Boy was or probably deviate from his light hearted niche?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think David has found his sweet spot. It\u2019s almost like we have forgotten but the huge positive uprising that happened last year, which is the EndSARS movement, David\u2019s song ended up being the song track for that whole movement.\n\nSo this man makes impactful music, he has the pedigree to back it up, He has the fanbase, he has the people, he has everything. So David has found his sweet spot. I don\u2019t think everyone has to sound the same.\n\nFor Burnaboy from the job, for those of us who were following him, everyone saw the view that at some point this guy called Burna Boy is going to win a Grammy. I\u2019m one of those people who wasn\u2019t surprised. I was literally just counting down to the day, he\u2019s that gifted, and his international appeal and his close relationship with Atlantic. Atlantic realised they had a gem in their hand and they really went out to position him like one.\n\nHow do you make an album like that and you do not have a Grammy? It\u2019s impossible. Diddy is your executive producer, Anderson Park is playing drums in there and Youssou N\u2019Dour is in there, you know, and all this other thing, and then you have the world\u2019s famous Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin\u2019s on that record. So every step of the way, you know this was a Grammy product, this was positioned for that and it eventually got it. Besides, a year before he had gotten a nomination, the one that he lost to another African legend Angelique Kidjo, so everybody just knew that it\u2019s only a matter of time, this guy is gonna get this nomination again and he\u2019s going to win. So, I have no doubt in my mind that as long as David continues to do his thing, he is going to win it at some point.\n\nWould there be any career regret if Davido never wins a Grammy?\n\nNo, there will be none. He is an accomplished artiste as it is. It was this year that Nas got his Grammy for the first time and there are plenty of other people that never got the Grammy but we know that these people are some of the finest artistes. Do you know Snoop Dogg never won a Grammy?\n\nSo there are plenty of other people like that, so sometimes these things happen. Maybe you dropped a project in a year, well then just so happened to be like a bigger or more popular project and then, you know there are those variables and these things that happen. So in my opinion David is really an accomplished musician, he has traveled round the world, he has met everybody, he has made money, he has made a clout, I mean what else is there to do? At this point he just needs to keep making music because that is what he has feelings for.\n\nWhat can young hungry artistes out there learn from Davido?\n\nBe open to collaboration. Know that using a songwriter does not mean you\u2019re a terrible musician, sometimes you write alone, sometimes you need to sing somebody\u2019s perspective to give your music that bit of freshness.\n\nSecond, you need to show that you want it, you need to be hungry about this thing, like I said before, David is not the first rich kid we have seen, but we have seen plenty of them who didn\u2019t seem to have that fight in them.\n\nThird, you have to be passionate, this is what you love, submit to it. One vibe you get from David is that this brother has genuine love for music. Just follow your heart, be passionate, be hardworking and if you have money to put in, put it in, be an entrepreneur.\n\nI want to add something else, just in case we don\u2019t get to touch that. Let us not forget that in the history of artistes who run record labels, we possibly have not had anyone that has been successful as DMW. So away from being an artiste, even as an executive or a label guy, David has been hugely successful, Mayorkun is big, Perruzi is big, Dremo, all these other people, so unlike all other guys who have tried to start a label, even the people he\u2019s competing with, a lot of them do not have anything going on that level, but away from David being this guy, he has also successfully built a platform that is huge as well, so David the executive also deserves a lot of kudos.\n\nHas Afrobeats peaked with this Grammy win and its present level of influence?\n\nI do not think so. If anything, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re just getting started. I was recently saying to someone, these days it appears like the producers outside Nigeria are even starting to make better Afrobeats production or songs than us. People like Jay Five, people like P2J, there\u2019s this guy in Los Angeles who does work for Tiwa savage and Seyi Shay plenty of these people, these guys are making incredible stuff. You know how a black American cannot really really say hip hop is our thing anymore because in Asia they now make hip hop, Africans make hip hop, a lot of people make hip hop, so that\u2019s the beauty of your tradition on your product going across. It sort of gets to a place where it feels like it\u2019s no longer yours anymore because a lot of people have now bought into your product and they love it so I see that happening with Afrobeats.\n\nAnother thing is that these guys are still young and they\u2019re going to continue making music. Wizkid is a big superstar, look at what he did with Made in Lagos, so projects like that help to reinforce the importance of this genre, people like Burna Boy, Burna Boy is only just getting started, Davido is a young man, he\u2019s just getting started, let\u2019s not even talk about the younger people who are coming behind them, Buju, Joeboy, Fireboy DML, Tems, all these people, so I think we\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nHow can the government key into the million dollars Afrobeats industry now and provide active and actual beneficial support to the growth of the industry now?\n\nMaybe that ship might have sailed because before we got into this digital age, we used to beg the government to come and help us stop piracy, come and help us stop this people who are creating our CDs and selling, come and help us stop these people in Alaba who are faking our products, but now with digital, nobody even cares about them anymore, so you find out that more and more we don\u2019t even need to talk to these people, we don\u2019t need them for anything. The labels have stepped up, were getting investments, international labels are coming in to partner with our local guys here, we have big artiste development and artiste relation companies like Platoon, like ONErpm, like Empire, like Orchard and all this people coming to Nigeria to set up shop, so it appears that through our own sheer determination and hard work, we have taken this thing to a level where it has really taken off, all the government can do is to congratulate people where the would help us.\n\nSo there\u2019s no role left for the government now?\n\nPerhaps that ship has sailed, so maybe they should perhaps help us add more event centres, you know just put in laws and regulations that help people to do business more easily. But generally, the success has gone beyond them.\n\nFans of Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy are always pitching against themselves on social media. Is this beneficial to the artistes or can it be very damaging to their career and industry growth in the long term?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Because these people are the people who speak up and drum up support for these people that helps to take them to the next level. So now the onus is on the artistes and their handlers to understand that hey, you people must remain friends ooh. You must know that these people would always come with these competitive problems but you guys must know that hey, fans are just doing what fans do.\n\nHowever the competitiveness is what makes it fun. A lot of times, if there\u2019s no competition people are not really bothered to go the extra mile, so there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\nDavido coming to tweet and say \u2018Yo, my fans stop doing this doesn\u2019t change anything\u2019, yeah, you get on Twitter you would discover that there are a lot of handles that are dedicated solely to these guys and all they do is talk about them, tweet them and drop fights and everything. So at that point it is out of your hand, it is just up to you to understand that now it\u2019s part of the game, but these people are my brothers and we should not let what the fans say make us enemies but however, the noise that the fans are making out is important.\n\nObinna Agwu is a music executive and talent manager who has had in his clientele MI Abaga amid a plethora of other artistes.\n\nListen to his expert analysis of happenings in the entertainment industry on Listening Session Podcast",

          "title": "The Economist: Nigeria\u2019s economy is stuck in a rut",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 4\n\nRising oil prices will bring short-term relief, butmay delay essential reforms.\n\nTALK THAT everything is expensive fills the air at a market in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital. Since February the minibus fare from home to the market has doubled, says Emmanuel Mokwe, who sells kitchen utensils. So has the price of food, he adds grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos,\u201d says Dotun Babande, who runs a juice shop across town.\n\nInflation is running at 18%. For food it is 23%, the highest in two decades. More than half of Nigerians are underemployed or unemployed. Before covid-19 about 80m of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic andpopulation growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023,says the World Bank.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic woes also help explain a vertiginous rise in crime. More people were kidnapped in the first four months of this year thanall of last year, according to Jose Luengo-Cabrera of the World Bank.This has added to worsening violence around three flashpoints: thejihadists of Boko Haram in the north-east; a long-standing conflict between farmers and cattle- herders across central Nigeria; and fighting between government forces and Igbo separatists in the south-east.\n\nCovid-19 has slammed economies everywhere, but Nigeria\u2019s economicmalaise predates the pandemic. GDP per person has fallen every yearsince 2015, when oil prices slumped (see chart). The World Bank reckons that by the end of the year real income per person in Nigeria, home to one in six of sub- Saharan Africa\u2019s people, will be at the same level as it was in the 1980s. Reform is desperately needed, but fiendishly difficult to enact.\n\nAlthough oil makes up about 9% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, it accounts for 80% of export earnings and about half of government revenues. A long slump in its price\u2014from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to less than half thatfor most of last year\u2014has squeezed the supply of foreign exchange.\n\nNormally economies would adjust by letting their exchange rates fall, making imports more expensive. This can be painful in the short term since it fuels inflation. But usually it helps boost exports by making them more competitive. If Nigeria could make, grow or mine more forexport, it would be less vulnerable to swings in the oil price.\n\nInstead, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has restricted imports in an effort to prop up the currency, which he sees asa measure of Nigeria\u2019s strength. In an attempt to conserve dollars, thecentral bank has banned those intending to import almost 50 items from buying foreign currency. Last month wheat and sugar were added to the list. In 2019 Mr Buhari closed Nigeria\u2019s land borders to goods to stop smugglers undermining local producers. Both moves have fuelled food-price inflation.\n\nThey have also hobbled manufacturing firms by making it hard for themto obtain inputs. Manufacturers would be lucky if they get 20% of the forex they request, says Muda Yusuf of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ajibade Oluwabukunmi imports medical equipment and uses the volatile black market, where dollars cost almost 30% more than the official rate. \u201cNigeria is in a shambles,\u201d he laments. Despite all its unorthodox controls, the central bank was forced to devalue the naira twice last year. Businesses are getting neither a stable currency nor access to dollars.\n\nThe government may slowly be changing its tune. Bismarck Rewane, an economist who is also on the president\u2019s council of economic advisers, says that \u201cthe futility of a Robinson Crusoe economy became very clear for everybody\u201d. The government is starting to pay more attention to exporters, he claims, pointing to the partial reopening of land bordersfor goods in December and Nigeria\u2019s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2019.\n\nYet sustained growth in exports requires more than just opening the border. Many firms are uncompetitive because they are hampered by red tape and government failures. \u201cGovernment is the biggest problem for business in Nigeria,\u201d says Bashir Abdulrahman of Credent Capital and Advisory, an investment bank.\n\nElectricity blackouts are maddeningly frequent. Roads are often poor and ports clogged up. Moving a container 20km from the port of Lagosto the city can cost $4,000, almost as much as shipping it 12,000km from China. Nigeria ranks 131st out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s ease-of- doing-business index. Although some industries, such as information technology, are growing, this is \u201cin spite of the government\u201d, says Tayo Oviosu of Paga, a mobile-payments company.\n\nThe government has tried to give the poor more aid to get them through the pandemic. It also promises to improve infrastructure. But spending on salaries and other annual costs chews up 75% of the federal budget, leaving little money to invest in roads or railways. With a view to freeing funds for infrastructure, the government last year promised to cut costly fuel subsidies. Yet that has been halted in the face of opposition.\n\nThe stalled reform is typical of Nigeria\u2019s troubles. For decades cash from oil has been used to subsidise things like fuel and electricity. The easy revenue also allowed the federal and state governments to getaway with abysmal tax collection. Worse, it fostered corruption.\n\nMany Nigerians have had enough. Between 2014 and 2018 the percentage who want to emigrate rose from 36% to 52%, one of thehighest levels in Africa. Rising oil prices this year will ease the shortages and boost government finances. Yet that may reduce the pressure to fix deeper economic problems, admits Kayode Fayemi, a state governor. Nonetheless, he believes there is an \u201calmost overwhelming consensus\u201d on the need to restructure the economy. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it,\u201d he warns, \u201cwe run the risk of disintegration.\u201d ?\n\nThis article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \u201cStuck in a rut\u201d for the Economist Magazine.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

The schools are opened, our offices and hospitals are opened.\n\n\u201cNLC is aware that inflicting pain on citizens, locking hospitals and public institutions, shutting down electricity will not change or affect the decision of Kaduna State government,\u201d Mohammed said on Monday.\n\nThe Kaduna State government also in a tweet on Monday described the action of the NLC workers as \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome unlawful actions by the NLC: shutting down electricity, coercion and restraints of personal freedom, trespass into public facilities and denial of access to healthcare for several of our citizens. They closed several hospitals and chased away the patients.\n\n\u201cGeneral hospitals in Kawo, Tudun-Wada, Kafanchan, Giwa, Rigasa, Kakuri and Sabon Tasha were illegally locked.

          "text": "A top medical organisation in Japan has thrown its weight behind calls to cancel the Tokyo Olympics, saying hospitals are already overwhelmed as the country battles a spike in coronavirus infections less than three months from the start of the Summer Games.\n\nIn an open letter to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association said hospitals in the host city \u201chave their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe strongly request that the authorities convince the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that holding the Olympics is difficult and obtain its decision to cancel the Games,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe association, which represents about 6,000 primary care doctors, made the appeal amid a jump in infections that has resulted in a shortage of hospital beds in some parts of the Japanese capital and stoked alarm across the country.\n\nSuga on Friday extended a third state of emergency in Tokyo and several other prefectures until May 31.\n\nBut the prime minister said that holding a \u201csafe and secure\u201d Olympic games was possible if tight preventive measures were implemented, including actions that would keep ordinary Japanese from coming into contact with those arriving in connection with the Games.\n\nA majority of the Japanese public, however, oppose hosting the Olympics this year.\n\nA weekend poll by the Asahi Shimbun daily found that 43 percent of people surveyed want the Games cancelled, while 40 percent want a further postponement.\n\nThose figures are up from the 35 percent who backed cancellation in a survey by the paper a month ago and the 34 percent who wanted a further delay.\n\nMeanwhile, an online petition with more than 350,000 signatures calling for the Tokyo Games to be cancelled was also submitted Friday to local organizers, the IOC and others.\n\nSoon, doctors would face the added difficulty of dealing with heat exhaustion in patients during the summer months, the letter said.\n\nIt added that if the Olympics contributed to a rise in deaths, \u201cJapan will bear the maximum responsibility.\u201d\n\nOverall, Japan has avoided an explosive spread of the virus experienced by other nations, with 11,500 deaths recorded since the pandemic began.\n\nBut the government has come under sharp criticism for its sluggish vaccination rollout. Only about 3.5 percent of its population of about 126 million has been vaccinated so far.",

          "text": "Tyson Fury has been ordered to fight Deontay Wilder for a third time, casting doubt over a proposed August super bout with Anthony Joshua. Fury, 32, won the WBC world heavyweight title from Wilder in a rematch in February 2020 after an initial draw.\n\nThe pair were due to fight again but delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic prompted Fury to seek an alternative.\n\nOn Monday a US judge ruled in mediation that Wilder has a right to face Fury for a third time before 15 September. The American\u2019s team had long argued their fighter had a contractual right to a third fight with Fury.\n\nBut after delays caused by the pandemic led to a July 2020 contest being postponed, Wilder\u2019s team then sought to move the bout into 2021.\n\nFury refused the 2021 date and stated he would move on. That prompted mediation overseen by American judge Daniel Weinstein, who has now sided with Wilder and set a 15 September deadline for a third contest.\n\nFury\u2019s US promoters Top Rank did not wish to comment on the development when contacted by BBC Sport.\n\nJust 24 hours before Monday\u2019s arbitration hearing, Fury confirmed he had agreed to fight fellow Briton Joshua \u2013 holder of the IBF, WBA and WBO belts \u2013 for all four heavyweight world titles in Saudi Arabia on 14 August.\n\nJoshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn has also stated several times that the August bout was in place with terms agreed.\n\nThe mediation outcome does not necessarily mean a Fury-Joshua fight cannot take place in August but fresh deals will now need to be struck for it to do so.\n\nThis could take the form of Wilder being offered a financial sum to allow Fury-Joshua to take place.\n\nSaudi authorities are reportedly putting forward around \u00a3106m just to stage the Fury-Joshua contest.\n\nPay-per-view sales and ticket sales will serve to substantially add to the total revenue of the contest.\n\nIf it goes ahead, Joshua versus Fury will be the first bout in heavyweight history where all four world titles are on the line.\n\nJust 24 hours after Fury said he had been in conversation with Saudi organisers and agreed to seal the deal, this Wilder news will come as a blow. How big of a blow is yet to be made clear.\n\nWith so much money to be made from Joshua v Fury, one would think a deal will be struck with Wilder whereby he steps aside and perhaps even gets told he can face whoever stands as champion in 2022.\n\nIt may suit him to do so given he can pocket a sizeable sum and prepare with a fight of his own in the short-term as he has been out of the ring for 15 months.\n\nIt should be stated that there were already countless moving parts to a Joshua-Fury deal with three promoters, several broadcasters, four sanctioning bodies and a host venue all needing to work as one. In a business where politics can often play a part, it was never going to be easy.\n\nAny postponement would prove highly damaging for the sport given so many fans away from the boxing hardcore will tune in to watch it. It is a golden opportunity to draw new people into the sport and fights with such a crossover appeal rarely arise.",

          "text": "Attorneys for Rudy Giuliani say a covert warrant that prosecutors obtained for his Apple iCloud account in November 2019 and a raid last month by agents who seized his electronic devices show they are treating him more like a drug kingpin or terrorist than a personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a letter to a federal judge in Manhattan, the lawyers said that by secretly seizing Giuliani\u2019s cloud data files in 2019, investigators had improperly intruded on private communications with the president.\n\nThe seized files, they wrote, likely included \u201cmaterial relating to the impending impeachment, the welfare of the country, and to national security.\u201d\n\nThey asked the judge to unseal affidavits in support of the Nov. 4, 2019, search warrant. Reviewing the affidavits, the lawyers said, will help them expand their argument \u201cthat this unilateral, secret review was illegal\u201d and that any evidence gathered from it should be suppressed.\n\nThe letter was sent to a Manhattan federal judge who is considering whether to appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to protect attorney-client privilege during a review of evidence gathered from raids on Giuliani\u2019s residence and office in April.\n\nIt was initially sent last week. A redacted version was made public Monday.\n\nA spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York are examining Giuliani\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian figures and whether he violated a federal law that governs lobbying on behalf of foreign countries or entities without registering with the U.S. government.\n\nAny warrant issued in 2019 as part of that inquiry, or any other investigation, would have been approved by a neutral judge.\n\nGiuliani, a Republican and former New York City mayor who represented Trump in the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation, has not been charged with a crime.\n\nHe has said his activities in Ukraine were conducted on behalf of Trump. At the time, Giuliani was leading a campaign to press Ukraine for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter before the Democrat was elected president.\n\nSome Ukrainians who dealt with Giuliani as he campaigned against the Bidens were also looking for his help with matters of their own, including arranging meetings with U.S. officials or pressuring the Trump administration to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s lawyers have argued that the early morning April raids on his home and office were not necessary because he had made clear in 2019 that he would answer any questions without restrictions, except for privileged matters, as long as his lawyers knew what subjects would be discussed.\n\nThey said prosecutors instead \u201csimply chose to treat a distinguished lawyer as if he was the head of a drug cartel or a terrorist, in order to create maximum prejudicial coverage of both Giuliani, and his most well known client \u2013 the former President of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the lawyers wrote, the original warrant for Giuliani\u2019s iCloud account contained a non-disclosure order based on an allegation made to a judge that Giuliani might destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses if he knew the warrant existed.\n\n\u201cSuch an allegation, on its face, strains credulity. It is not only false, but extremely damaging to Giuliani\u2019s reputation. It is not supported by any credible facts and is contradicted by Giuliani\u2019s efforts to provide information to the Government. We should be allowed to question the Government as to what basis it had, if any, to make that assertion,\u201d they said.\n\nGiuliani attorney Robert Costello said prosecutors have another week to respond to the letter.\n\nIn a separate letter dated last week but filed publicly Monday, lawyers for Victoria Toensing \u2014 a Washington lawyer whose phone was seized last month as part of the same investigation \u2014 asked a judge to order the Justice Department to return her cell phone as well as information collected from her iCloud and Google accounts from what they described as \u201ccovert warrants\u201d in 2019.\n\nGiven the breadth of the warrants, the lawyers wrote, \u201cit is virtually certain that the materials the Government received included substantial privileged and confidential information concerning clients and criminal matters that have nothing to do with this investigation, privileged and confidential information concerning unrelated other matters that are actively before the DOJ, and privileged and confidential information that is the subject of the warrants.\u201d\n\nThe defence lawyers said the government has so far declined to reveal what materials a specialized filter team has acquired, reviewed or turned over to the investigative team.",
