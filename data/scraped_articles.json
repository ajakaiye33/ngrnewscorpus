          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Says Finance Minister\u2019s careless statement can set nation on fire\n\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young\n\nOrganised Labour yesterday condemned and rejected plans by the federal government to slash workers\u2019 salaries, warning that such a careless statement could set the nation\u2019s on fire.\n\nLabour in a statement by the President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Finance to order before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements.\n\nReacting to the statement credited to the Finance Minister that the Federal Government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers, NLC expressed shock with such utterance.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIt is almost unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cIt was with huge shock that we read the statement credited to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who said that the Federal Government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers.\n\n\u2018\u2019 Minister was reported to have said this in Abuja at a policy dialogue on corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Minister was also reported to have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to immediately review the salaries of civil servants and the number of federal agencies in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is almost unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time. The question to ask is \u2018which salary is the government planning to slash?\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30,000 which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice. The proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay!\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the multiple devaluations of the Naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria has knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across the board.\n\n\u2018\u2019Nigerian workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth. Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce a salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cThis call for salary slash by Mrs Zainab Ahmed is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers. It is most uncharitable, most insensitive, most dehumanizing and most barbaric. Nigerian workers demand an immediate retraction and apology by the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Finance to order now before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements. If there is any salary that needs serious slashing, it is the humungous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders in Nigeria who do very little but collect so much!\n\n\u201cWorkers generate surplus value and revenue for the government. We do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance! It is also important to make the point that salaries are products of contracts governed by laws. They cannot be unilaterally adjusted.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\npalliatives to help their people through the terrible socio-economic dislocations occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be completely absurd for the Nigerian government to be thinking of salary slash.\n\n\u2018\u2019This move is not only at great odds with global best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is also in violation of relevant ILO Conventions and Declarations on Wages and Decent Work.\n\n\u201cWe urge Government as a social partner to quickly respond to the demands by Labour for an upward review of salaries of all Nigerian workers. Nigerian workers have shown sufficient understanding with the government through the tough patches of the pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2019Now, Nigerian workers demand reciprocity of our understanding. Nigerian workers demand an increase in their remunerations and allowances. Enough is enough!\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Something has to be done urgently to save the situation.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Nigeria of the dream of my generation; certainly, this is not the Nigeria we used to know. We are seeing and facing a different Nigeria. The Nigeria we used to know was a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNot that there were no crimes but they were minimal. It was not in an alarming rate as we have now. There were only pockets of crimes, the issues then were not overwhelming. Those into crime and criminality at the time were very insignificant compared to the number we have now.\n\n\u201cMajority of us are now criminals, I am not exonerating myself. A lot of things have changed, this can be picked from different spheres of life so that we can analyze,\u201d the Catholic Bishop said.\n\nHe noted that insecurity has so heightened now to the extent that even governors with all the security apparatus they have are now even afraid of travelling by roads, declaring that if something is not done urgently, Nigeria is heading for doom.\n\nAccording to the clergyman, \u201cif you look at the area of security, not that there were no armed robbery then, you can get to anywhere in this country without any fear or hesitation, though we had some pockets of issues relating to armed robbery but they were not as prevalent as they are today.\n\n\u201cIt is so bad now that even a governor is afraid of traveling by road. A governor was attacked by bandits despite all the paraphernalia of office at his disposal; he is also suffering from attack. If we do not do something urgently, then we are heading for doom.\u201d\n\nDachelem noted that, \u201ca lot of factors are responsible for getting us to where we are now. Generally, both leaders and the led are responsible for how we got to the point at which we are now though I will say 60% of the fault goes to the leadership. First, let me confidently say that the leadership then secondly laissez Faire of the leadership.\u201d\n\nHe, however, strongly condemned the spate of kidnapping and banditry across the country, which he attributed to unemployment among the youth, noting that incidence of kidnappings and banditry had become one too many.\n\nHe called on the appropriate authorities to urgently tackle these headlong with a view to putting an end to them immediately, \u201cbefore one day, we will all wake up and find ourselves kidnapped\u201d.\n\nThe Catholic Priest stated that despite all that were happening today, there was still hope of a better country if the right steps were taken by the government urgently.\n\nAccording to Bishop Dachelem, \u201cit is not too late to act now. We can still get it right if we collectively work together.\u201d",

Their plan was to even send me to Rome after the 30 days.\n\n\u201cI asked them why I was being punished. They cannot not tell me who to bless. They are angry that I blessed Nnamdi Kanu. I am a priest of God and nobody can tell me who to bless. Is it your blessing? Are you the one giving him life? Are you the one giving him life?

It was learnt that the priest may have emerged from the Government House axis of Enugu.\n\nEyewitnesses said having received no positive response and fearing that the bishop may have handed the priest to security agents, the protesters had descended on Bishop\u2019s Court, residence of Bishop Onaga, and vandalised property, especially glasses, doors, the Bishop\u2019s office before marching to destroy a bookshop, guest house, two buildings, four big water tanks and other facilities at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Some workers there sustained various degrees of injury.\n\nThere was heavy presence of joint security forces of the army, police, National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services both at the Bishop\u2019s Court and the Holy Ghost Cathedral.\n\nDSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, had denied that Mbaka was in their custody.\n\nFears of his possible arrest arose as Mbaka last week Wednesday called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over worsening security challenges in the country.\n\nLast Sunday, the DSS issued a warning to individuals and groups to be mindful of utterances and actions that threatened the country\u2019s peace and sovereignty.",

          "text": "\u2022Propose percentage payment of statutory allocation to legislative arm\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nGovernors have shifted ground in their quest for an earnest resolution of the industrial crisis caused by the clamour by judicial and legislative workers for the implementation of financial autonomy for the two arms of government.\n\nTHISDAY gathered yesterday that the governors had proposed to pay lawmakers a certain percentage of their statutory monthly entitlements towards funding the legislature.\n\nA source said the governors\u2019 offer followed the refusal of speakers of Houses of Assembly of the 36 states of the federation to accept the N100 million monthly offer made by the governors for each state legislature.\n\nIn rejecting the irreducible minimum payment of N100 million monthly to each of the legislatures in the states to fund their operations, the speakers had insisted on N250 million monthly.\n\nIt was also gathered that the governors had also rejected the demand of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) that the gross allocations should be remitted to the two arms of government directly.\n\nThe governors\u2019 hard-line position was said to be responsible for the delay in the resolution of the strike embarked upon by judicial and parliamentary workers in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to press for the implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nHowever, the governors agreed that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will handle funds for states\u2019 judicial councils to take care of the high courts while the state governments will be responsible for funding the magistrates and customary courts.\n\nIn a bid to resolve the issues and end the ongoing industrial dispute, the federal government has invited the leadership of JUSUN and PASAN to a negotiation today.\n\nA statement by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, said the Minister, Senator Chris Ngige, would host the negotiations with the workers.\n\nAn earlier plan to hold talks with the striking workers was stalled by a lack of harmony in the positions of the team representing the federal government and that of governors.\n\nThe Solicitor-General of the Federation, Mr. Dayo Apata, who had represented the federal government, and the Director-General of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Mr. Asishana Okauru, had presented different position papers, which stalled negotiations.\n\nBut a source told THISDAY yesterday that the two parties had reached a consensus, while all the grey areas have been resolved.\n\nHe confirmed that Ngige would schedule a meeting with the leadership of JUSUN and PASAN to sort out any other outstanding issues.\n\nHe said: \u201cRight now; there\u2019s a consensus. There\u2019s some agreement, grey areas have been cleared and I think the minister is committed to putting a meeting together with the workers and in the next couple of days. I think all the grey areas will be sorted out.\n\n\u201cSome of the grey areas for the judiciary, for instance, is that it is clear to all the parties now that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will be handling that because that\u2019s the position of the constitution. They have been doing that for recurrent at the state level, but have not been doing it for capital spending.\n\n\u201cThat will continue, especially for courts of record. The governors will be in charge of customary courts and magistrates courts.\n\n\u201cFor the legislature, the major issue was whether the deduction should be based on gross or net. What they have agreed is that it is going to be an agreed percentage of appropriated amount.\u201d\n\nFollowing the different positions adopted by the federal government and the governors, Ngige had urged the governors to rework the agreement for negotiations to resume.\n\nThe governors had accepted in principle the funding of both the state legislatures and judiciaries from their allocations from the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), to be deducted from the States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC).\n\nAs part of its implementation, the state governments were expected from May 1, to set up the States Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC) with members from the states Assembly committee chairmen on Finance and the States Commissioners of Finance to discuss on monthly basis the disbursement of funds.\n\nHowever, the governors and speakers could not reach a consensus on how much to be given to each state legislature monthly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges release of kidnapped Greenfield university scholars\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed excitement at the news of the release of the remaining 29 students of the Federal College of Forestry, Afaka, Kaduna abducted from their school 55 days ago.\n\nChairman of the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students, Mr. Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the release of the students to THISDAY.\n\n\u201cYes, they have been released. They did not sleep in the (bandits) camp yesterday. They were taken to the residence of one of the mediators to sleep. We have already sent our people with vehicles and ambulances to go and bring them. We are expecting them any moment from now,\u201d Usman said.\n\nThe bandits had invaded the school on March 11 and abducted 39 of the students.\n\nThey later freed 10 of them in two batches of five after the parents had reportedly paid N17 million ransoms.\n\nUsman described the release of the students as \u201ca big relief to parents,\u201d who have been emotionally traumatised since the incident.\n\nThe parents had on Tuesday protested at the National Assembly in Abuja.\n\nHowever, attempts to confirm the release of the students from the police were unsuccessful as Mr. Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command was unreachable on the telephone.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the release of the students was nearly frustrated following a claim by one of the parents during their protest in Abuja on Tuesday that they paid N800, 000 to one of the mediators.\n\nA source among the parents told THISDAY that the claim by the woman that they paid N800, 000 to an associate of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi nearly stalled the negotiation process.\n\nHe said the allegation angered Gumi and others helping to ensure the release of the students and they were not taking their calls.\n\nAccording to him, the woman was not part of the meeting with Gumi and wondered how she got such unfounded information.\n\nThe woman had said that the parents were taken to Gumi, who directed them to a Fulani man named Ahmed.\n\nShe said the parents paid N800, 000 to the man but the man said the money was for transportation and insisted that they should pay an additional N500 million.\n\nHowever, the source who said he was part of the negotiations, stated that the woman made her comments out of ignorance.\n\n\u201cThat woman made that unfortunate comment out of ignorance. It is just side talks. She was not at the meeting with Gumi; so, she didn\u2019t know what happened at the meeting. She just heard what some people are talking about at the corner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe parents of the 39 students later issued a statement dismissing the claims that they gave out N800, 000 to the Fulani man, who was recommended by Gumi.\n\nIn the statement issued in Kaduna, the parents said: \u201cThe claim has no basis.\u201d\n\nThe statement jointly signed Mr. Abdullahi Usman and Ms. Catherine Saleh, Chairman and Secretary respectively of the parents\u2019 union, also apologised to Gumi, \u201cfor any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement said though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, \u201cher claim is untrue,\u201d, as she was not a member of the (negotiation) committee representing the parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\u201d\n\nBuhari Excited\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari expressed happiness with the release of the students yesterday.\n\nHe also pleaded with the kidnappers to effect the release of the abducted students of Greenfield University also in Kaduna and other Nigerians being held in captivity.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, congratulated the released students\u2019 friends, families and the government and people of Kaduna State following the happy end to the saga.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are happy they have been released,\u201d while also expressing deep appreciation to all the actors who contributed one way or the other to the happy outcome, \u201cin particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State. We thank Nigerians for their prayers.\u201d\n\nHe called for steadfastness and security awareness on the part of citizens and the law enforcement agencies and deplored the increasing politicization of security in the country by opportunistic politicians.\n\nHe appealed for the release of the students of Greenfield University and all other citizens held in captivity, expressing the strong determination of his administration to ensure that Nigerians lived in a country where everyone can move where they want, when they want without the fear of kidnapping and banditry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Elumelu Calls for Urgent Power Sector Reforms to Boost Economy",
          "text": "\u2022Commends CBN on FX management\n\nBy Nume Ekeghe, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc Group Chairman and Founder, Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Mr. Tony Elumelu, has called for urgent reforms in the power sector to boost economic activities.\n\nElumelu, who is also the Chairman of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, also urged the federal government to invest more in electricity supply in order to create an avenue for innovation and economic development.\n\nHe spoke yesterday during an interview on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcasting arm of THISDAY Newspapers and lauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its foreign exchange management strategy as well as efforts to unify exchange rates.\n\nHe stressed the need for the federal government to focus on diversifying the economy in a bid to increase the country\u2019s forex inflow and reduce the dependence on oil revenue.\n\nAlso, responding to question on insider loan in companies he served as chairman, Elumelu stated that strict corporate governance are upheld in all the organisations.\n\nCommenting on the need for reforms in the power sector, he listed the three components of power supply as generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nHe said Nigerians would do better in business and creativity if they had steady electricity supply.\n\nHe decried the situation where inadequate electricity supply was crippling innovation and the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTranscorp through Transcorp Power and Afam Power today in Nigeria own the highest generating capacity in Nigeria that can generate 2,000 MW of electricity per day. But unfortunately, we do less than 500MW at this point in time and the major constraint in this area is gas; then there is the issue of transmission and there is the issue of payment.\n\n\u201cFor this to work well and for us to generate more, we need to have gas and our group has invested in oil and gas. And so, for us as a group, it is not necessarily for oil, it is because of gas because we want to be able to ensure that we have gas from our oil and gas production to convert to electricity.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition we did recently, I\u2019m happy to say, it is already supplying gas to our power plant. But going back to the subsidiary element, the issue of transmission, we need to make sure we stabilise our transmission for take-up.\u201d\n\nHe said Transcorp invested in the power sector to help Nigerians have access to electricity because businesses across all sectors of the economy like health, e-commerce, manufacturing, SMEs, among others, need power.\n\n\u201cThey cannot grow their businesses without adequate electricity.\n\nNigerian and African youths are multi-talented, but they need a steady electricity supply to be creative and innovative,\u201d he said.\n\nElumelu said if the government improves access to electricity in Nigeria, the Nigerian youths will create the Nigerian version of Silicon Valley and the likes of Steve Job and Bill Gates, explaining that what is holding Nigerian youths to a large extent is the lack of adequate electricity.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs at least 100,000 MW of electricity a day to power the economy but today we operate less than 5,000 MW and we need to do more,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGovernment, therefore, needs to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN and its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for the support given in the area of metering.\n\nHe said to drive the economy, power generation has to be increased by fixing the gas supply to generating companies, adding that there was the need to make sure that the transmission lines are utilised to evacuate the power as well as ensure that power generated is taken by Discos and the end-users and they pay.\n\nThe business mogul said: \u201cPower is still a critical sector; we need to invest and the stakeholders need to make sure that it works. And when it works, the country\u2019s economic development becomes more real.\n\n\u201cEvery sector of our economy needs the power sector and I think we need to prioritise it more. But I commend efforts going on and also by making sure we privatise the remaining ones. The transmission lines need to be fixed and we need to make sure we improve the payment system.\u201d\n\nHe advocated the privatisation of the entire value-chain of the power sector.\n\nElumelu stated: \u201cThe area of privatising the transmission lines, I think that ultimately, it should be privatised. What some of us have advocated is that the Gencos, the Discos and the entire power stakeholders should come together and have a deal with the federal government to take over the transmission lines and it would be in our self-interest to make sure it works.\n\n\u201cWe have the transmission lines and it doesn\u2019t work when you are generating, there is no way you would evacuate your power. That sector is so critical and pivotal for the survival of the power sector. It is critical to improving access to electricity, and where it is now there is no problem but what is important to us is that we have expanded capacity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the recent development at First Bank Nigeria Limited, Elumelu declined to make a comment.\n\nBut he said the decisions arrived at in resolving the board crisis in the bank were appropriate and beneficial to all major stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou need to understand the unique situation of this question. I am chairman of a competing institution and it may not be prudent for me to express a judgment or comment on this because it may not be very professional of me.\n\n\u201cBut I know the shareholders of the bank, and I also know the regulatory mindset, and the regulators want a safe banking environment and I believe the shareholders also seek that in due course, I believe they would be able to resolve the issues. I must say the banking sector has done very well, both the regulatory part and the participants.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on if UBA is exposed to insider trading and lending with his other businesses, he stated that his oil and gas interests were financed by a consortium of local and international banks, excluding UBA.\n\nIn addition, his other ventures have exposure below the threshold and the loans are serviced.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe oil and gas acquisition we just made, UBA did not participate in the funding. It is a club of international and local lenders. The local receiving bank for our proceeds is Union Bank of Nigeria and the international receiving bank of our oil sales is Standard Chartered Bank, London.\n\n\u201cThe transaction was funded by consortium of banks \u2013 Standard Chartered, ABSA IN South Africa, Afrexim, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank in Nigeria and a host of other international banks. So, we are mindful of all this and we are very prudent in making sure we do not put pressure on the bank.\n\n\u201cWe also put in equity investment and when we need to get investment, we try not to put pressure on the institution. What is important is that it is within the limit UBA should be exposed to a company and it is by the way performing very well. Our loans are performing very well.\u201d\n\nOn CBN forex management strategy, Elumelu said he supported efforts being made by the regulator to achieve convergence of rates.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo years ago, our vice president conveyed a meeting of a few of us to express our opinion and talk on the economy. The position then was quite critical at the time. But today, when things have improved, you should be also critical to say that things are moving in the right direction. On the convergence, I support it 100 per cent and I think we are there.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the saddle or seat you would see things more differently. For Nigeria, we generate foreign currency largely from oil. We used to produce around 2.5 million barrels before and today, we are doing 1.4 million barrels per day and that should have an impact on our foreign currency which is no rocket science.\n\n\u201cAlso, there was a time oil was $100 per barrel and it dropped to almost $40 per barrel and today it is at $69 per barrel. So, there is a basket of so many things we have to watch as economic managers in making decisions and there is a lot of pressure on our foreign currency.\n\n\u201cWhat people want to see from outside is a low exchange rate, but from the business world, people want to predict that this would be available and I think to a large extent, it is happening\n\nElumelu, who also spoke about the ease of doing business in Nigeria, said government must improve on its policy to attract more investors.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that investors, who are looking for where to invest their money, will go to countries where the policy on the ease of doing business is investor-friendly. The private sector must also work with government to ensure that the ease of doing business in Nigeria improves,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\nSpeaking on the impact of Tony Elumelu Foundation, Elumelu said it was established seven years ago to empower young Nigerians and Africans, stressing that the future of Africa remains in the hands of the youth who have key roles to play in developing Nigeria and the continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cI strongly feel it will be a waste of resources to save so much money in banks without using such money to empower people, especially when there is poverty among the masses. It is for this reason that we established Tony Elumelu Foundation to empower young people and make successful businesses out of them.\n\n\u201cEvery year, the foundation supports young people with a seed capital of $5,000 each, which is non-refundable and the foundation supports 1,000 people every year. We train them for 12 weeks and appoint business mentors for them and we create a networking platform for them to interact and grow their business ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the foundation gets support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union, stressing that the EU recently released $25 million.\n\nHe said the fund would be used for the next batch of trainees.\n\nElumelu stated that about 10, 000 Nigerians, including other Africans, have benefited from the training offered by the Tony Elumelu Foundation in the last seven years.\n\nOn the issue of girl-child education, Elumelu said there was a need to close the gap on gender inequality.\n\n\u201cI am a direct beneficiary of women\u2019s impact in molding the society, through the training I received from my mother, and cherish to support the girl-child education in order to bridge gender inequality,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nGiving details of his exit from UBA as managing director and chief executive officer, Elumelu said the orders came from the then CBN Governor, Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who felt that all bank CEOs that had served for 10 years, should step aside at that time.\n\n\u201cThat day, we had a Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting and at the end of the meeting, the then CBN Governor, Lamido Sanusi, told me that CEOs who had done 10 years will step aside. I called the chairman to explain what happened and the next day, we conveyed an emergency board meeting. At the board meeting, it was a divided household for the first time; some directors said \u2018no, we have to go to court to contest it\u2019 and about one or two other directors did not think so. But I spoke and I told the board members that there are five critical stakeholders here \u2013 the customers of UBA \u2013 will they like to know that we took our regulator to court? No, then the staff of UBA; will they be comfortable working in a bank that took their regulator to court? No, then the shareholders, then the regulators themselves, they wouldn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cSo, four constituents will not like us going to court.

          "text": "Wives of soldiers of the Nigerian Army fighting the Boko Haram insurgency war in the North-East have lamented that their husbands are haunted by nightmares, insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) and other disorders whenever they are allowed to be back home.\n\nThe women, under the aegis of Defence and Police Officers Wives Association, stated in Abuja that these psychological changes call for a post-traumatic stress disorder treatment.\n\nFile photo used to illustrate story.\n\nThe DEPOWA President, Mrs Victoria Irabor, who led her members on courtesy call to the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, at Army headquarters, said officers and soldiers usually return from conflict zones with physical injuries and suppressed emotional trauma.\n\nMrs Irabor said, as such, they had concluded plans to establish a state-of-the-art Post Trauma Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnostic centre, saying consultations with medical experts showed that those behavioural changes were triggered by trauma and could be known as PTSD.\n\n\u201cOne of the major issues is the distinct behavioural traits of returning officers such as nightmares, anxiety, insomnia, and bursts of anger, among others. These were not synonymous with our husbands\u2019 characters before deployment.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we intend to collaborate with the Chief of Army Staff to provide solutions by uniting our voices. It is our desire to have a reintegrated structure for our officers and husbands to ensure that they return to us in good health and total wellness.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I wish to propose the establishment of a PTSD evaluation and rehabilitation centre.\n\n\u201cIt will evaluate, counsel and provide adequate support to officers, soldiers and by extension their wives prior to reintegration from conflict zones.\n\n\u201cWe have a good number of medical facilities across military formations in the country, but they do not provide thorough diagnostic services to tackle some of these emerging challenges,\u201d she said.\n\nResponding, Attahiru commended DEPOWA for its foresight in addressing the physical and emotional needs of personnel and their families.\n\nThe army chief said the various programmes being executed across barracks were beneficial to all, assuring that all the services would support DEPOWA.\n\nThe issue of soldiers\u2019 welfare and allowances has been controversial in recent times with some of the personnel also claiming they were not adequately remunerated.\n\nIn 2018, the then Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.), also had pointed out that the Armed Forces Act 2004 needed an urgent amendment, as it did not provide any entitlement for soldiers killed or injured during war.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe Armed Forces Act, like any other human document, is not perfect. Several attempts have been made since 1993 to amend it. We have no issue with any amendment that will improve the welfare and rights of our citizens. While the military remains law abiding in its efforts, the terrorists, especially in the asymmetric warfare we are fighting, have nobody to account to.\n\n\u201cIt is in this light that I consider amendments in the Armed Forces Act that will accord statutory entitlements to members of the armed forces that are killed or wounded during action as such provision are not available in the extant enactment.\u201d",

          "text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague has sentenced Dominic Ongwen, ex-commander of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group in Uganda, to 25 years in prison for war crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOngwen was in February convicted on 61 of the 70 counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, forced marriage, forced pregnancy, pillaging and using child soldiers in the LRA.\n\nDelivering judgement on Thursday, Bertram Schmitt, ICC presiding judge, said the judges had to weigh Ongwen\u2019s brutality with his own tortured past when deciding on a sentence.\n\n\u201cThe chamber is confronted in the present case with a unique situation. It is confronted with a perpetrator who willfully brought tremendous suffering upon his victims,\u201d Schmitt said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHowever, it is also confronted with a perpetrator who himself had previously endured extreme suffering himself at the hands of the group of which he later became a prominent member and leader.\u201d\n\nFROM VICTIM TO REBEL COMMANDER\n\nDuring the trial in February, Ongwen\u2019s lawyers had argued that the convict was also a victim of LRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawyers had said he was abducted at the age of nine on his way to school by the LRA and forced to be a child soldier.\n\nOngwen rose to become the deputy commander after winning the confidence of Joseph Kony, LRA leader.\n\nHe later fell out with Kony and was on the run for a long time.

          "title": "Nigerian films on Youtube: Who\u2019s writing these crazy titles?",
          "text": "Before you read any further, I ask for your forgiveness in advance in case you think the above headline is too unwieldy. I think that, consciously or subconsciously, I may have been aiming to replicate the kind of crazy titles I have been seeing on Youtube which is the reason for this write up. Have you seen the titles of some Nigerian films on Youtube? Unfortunately, there are many who don\u2019t know that (sometimes) these titles which the authors must obviously consider catchy, aren\u2019t the real titles of the films. I tried convincing a friend who was so certain these were the actual titles. As if we don\u2019t have enough issues with our films, now we have to deal with laughable titles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me take a step back as I clarify some facts. The first thing is that there are different categories of film channels on Youtube. Not every channel is run by professionals or run professionally. There are those channels that are owned by filmmakers, film companies and there are some managed by professionals for other people. These types have a certain \u2018corporateness\u2019 about them and the kind of films on display usually have regular sounding titles. I mean if you visit Tunde Kelani\u2019s Youtube channel, you\u2019ll see his films like \u201cSaworoide\u201d I & 2; \u201cArugba,\u201d \u201cKoseegbe,\u201d and a few others. The other day, I checked out Blessing Effiom Egbe\u2019s channel-B\u2019Concept Network Productions-and watched \u201cA Dinner Date With X.\u201d Also saw the Uche Nancy-produced \u201cDead Without Money,\u201d which one of my daughters says is her \u2018best\u2019 film (story for another day). However, the \u2018corporate\u2019 kinds of channels are not the focus of this write up. I\u2019m talking about those channels where supposed film titles sound like long-winded sentences, long on descriptiveness but short on elegance. Perhaps, these people have access to intel or polling the rest of us don\u2019t know about which has convinced them that these kinds of titles draw traffic.\n\nHere are a few samples complete with mistakes from Top Love TV channel: \u201cI didn\u2019t Know D Boy I Hired As A Driver is a Billionaire Pretending\u2026,\u201d \u201cI Met Him on My Way From Jogging But I Never Knew He Was This Caring Until He visited-Nigeria Movies.\u201d From K.O.J TV: \u201cHow A Dirty Fruit Seller Wn D Heart Of D Rich Prince Who Came 2D Village In Search Of Love-Nigeria,\u201d \u201cShe Rejected Him Thinking He Is A Poor Palmwine Tapper, Not Knowing He Is A Disguised Billionaire,\u201d The Rich Prince Was Only Acting As A Poor Village PalmWine Tapper Just To Find True Love Nigerian,\u201d and \u201cA Billionair Princess Disguis As A Poor Forsaken Homeless Orphan In Search Of Who Would Truly Love Her.\u201d\n\nThe one thing that comes through these titles is how the writers look down on honest hardworking people. Words like \u2018common driver,\u2019 \u2018stinking teacher,\u2019 are often added to titles. Then of course, people are no longer millionaires but billionaires. If one didn\u2019t know any better, one would think that Nigeria is overflowing with undercover billionaires everywhere one turns. And for some reason, these billionaires live in garishly furnished houses with the most uncomfortable sets of furniture you\u2019d ever see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn quite a few of these films, women are seriously objectified: They\u2019re often shot from the ground up, like the camera person wants to ride inside their skirts. This often means that you\u2019re going to get the inexplicable close up on a woman\u2019s buttocks. The storylines can be equally as unedifying for women: Few women are ever gainfully employed or even self-employed. More often than not, they\u2019re planning some hare-brained schemes on how to get money out of supposedly rich men. Last week, I wrote about the movie \u201cSlay\u201d where intelligent and resourceful women were only trying to get men who\u2019d buy them drinks and nothing much else as far as I could see. They didn\u2019t even have cars as they were made to go though one undignifying episode to another in their dated wigs.\n\nAnd what\u2019s with the Hungry-Man-type food served in most of these films? I know I may have been influenced by the food in Korean drama. Even for seemingly ordinary people, there\u2019s usually a colourful spread. I\u2019m not under any illusion that what these Korean films and drama series show is how typical Koreans eat but the food is surely a spectacle that feeds the eyes. Watching \u201cI Met Him on My Way From Jogging But I Never Knew He Was This Caring Until He visited,\u201d and seeing two women fighting over the ubiquitous party jollof rice. The rice was so colourless and looked \u201chungry\u201d if food could be hungry! I can\u2019t recall the last time I saw anyone eating food other than rice in our films. How hard is it to cook any of our wide variety of Nigerian soups? Apart from the fact that our food doesn\u2019t get enough exposure, even imagine the visual spectacle our foods can create.\n\nFor today, my main issue is with these Youtube titles. Perhaps, when I can arrange my thoughts, I\u2019ll talk about the storylines of these Nigerian films on Youtube. I\u2019ve just seen \u201cI Need A Wife,\u201d starring Wole Ojo and Chinenye Nnebe who appear in a sizeable number of films. A guy rapes Adanma (Chinenye Nnebe) who just happened to be a virgin. At no point does the issue of his rape go towards seeking a legal remedy. Instead, the man is telling everyone who cares to listen about his love for Adanma, how he can\u2019t live without her, bla, bla, Surprisingly, she\u2019s the first to forgive him. Anyway, no one else was actually bothered except for lover boy Kelvin (Wole Ojo). So, I have to conclude by asking again: Who\u2019s writing all this rubbish?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnoshe Nwabuikwu, AIRTIME columnist is a renowned TV/Film critic, and Film scholar.

          "title": "Gozem\u2019s ride-hailing service goes live in Gabon, with Cameroon and DR Congo in view",
          "text": "Is there a ride-hailing service in Gabon? Yes, Gozem just launched there this week.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Emeka Ajene and Raphael Dana, Gozem operates an app that offers transportation, logistics, e-commerce and financial services in primarily-francophone African countries.\n\nGozem is aiming to be the super app for Africa and is modelled after the success of Gojek and WeChat in Southeast Asia and China respectively. While it is only one of many super app candidates in Africa, geographic expansion is a signal of strong intent.\n\nUntil the rollout in Gabon, Gozem was only available in cities across Togo and Benin, offering motorcycle taxis, tricycle taxis, and delivery of groceries, gas bottles, and meals.\n\nThe company says it has more than 500,000 registered users who have completed more than 2.5 million trips since inception.\n\nGabon will be Gozem\u2019s first operation outside of West Africa. The Central African country\u2019s population is under 2.5 million with almost 75% under the age of 30.\n\nScreenshots of the Gozem app. Image source: Gozem.\n\nThe ride-hailing feature is the only service Gabonese users will find on the app at the moment and it is only available in Libreville, the capital city.\n\n\u201cOur immediate focus is on providing a high-quality, reliable taxi service in that city, and then expanding the range of services we offer to Libreville\u2019s population,\u201d Ajene, Gozem co-founder and CEO, said to TechCabal.\n\nLaunching a taxi service in Gabon helps the company \u201cdiversify away from our beginnings as a 100% motorcycle-taxi oriented platform.\u201d\n\nWith Libreville in the mix, Gozem now operates in 10 cities across West and Central Africa. Ajene notes that most are not capital cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed an in-house capability to operate effectively in secondary cities in the region and there are one or two additional cities that you might ultimately see Gozem operating in in Gabon,\u201d he said.\n\nOne point of curiosity in this expansion is that Gabon is a smaller country by population compared to Togo (~8 million) and Benin (~ 12 million). Ajene acknowledges that but explains that purchasing power is another consideration that bears on expansion plans.\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita,\u201d Ajene said.\n\nIndeed, Gabon\u2019s 2020 GDP per capita was estimated to be $7,185, more than thrice the sum of Benin\u2019s $1,259 and Togo\u2019s $690.\n\n\n\nGozem\u2019s ride-hailing offering will work in Gabon like a standard app-enabled taxi booking service. Users download, sign up and input their destination to request rides. Driver accepts and the fare is calculated by distance. Users can pay in cash, with Airtel Money or Moov Money, or by credit card.\n\nRaphael Dana, Gozem co-founder, says the launch responds to the needs of the Gabonese population and aligns with Gozem\u2019s long-term plan to organise transport and commerce in Africa around the ongoing smartphone and internet revolution.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to consolidate our status as the premier super app in Africa, and this expansion to Central Africa, our first foray outside of West Africa, also allows us to prepare our upcoming expansion to Cameroon,\u201d Dana said.\n\nThe expansion to Cameroon is on the calendar for this year; DR Congo is also being explored. Beyond moving into new countries to enable taxis however, Gozem plans to make its other verticals compete with incumbents in the markets they currently operate.\n\n\u201cWe have robust food & e-commerce delivery verticals, we\u2019re beginning to see a significant impact coming from our vehicle financing vertical as well, and our plans for our full-service wallet are still on track,\u201d Ajene said.",

Pay1st features popular payment methods from six African countries, giving African gamers on Carry1st the ability to pay how they want.\n\nThe result is a company that is a publishing platform for games but also a full-stack management solution for game developers seeking user acquisition, marketing and monetization in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we were able to successfully sign 7 great titles, recruit a top-notch international team, and build out our payments and digital commerce platform,\u201d Robbin-Coker, CEO of Carry1st, said in a statement.\n\nRight to Left: Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu, Carry1st co-founders. Image source: Carry1st.\n\nNow the startup is positioned to take advantage of the stability and opportunity they have found. They have announced the close of a $6 million Series A round led by Konvoy Ventures, an early-stage VC firm based in the US State of Colorado. Carry1st joins a list of other gaming companies on Konvoy\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJackson Vaughan, Managing Partner at Konvoy Ventures, joins Carry1st\u2019s board as a result of the investment. He said Carry1st\u2019s advantage is in \u201capproaching sub-regions with contextual understanding.\u201d\n\nOther investors in the round include Riot Games (the company behind \u2018League of Legends\u2019), Raine Ventures, AET Fund / Akatsuki and TTV Capital.\n\nWith this round, Carry1st has now raised $9.5m since it was founded. The most recent funding round before this was in May 2020 when they raised $2.5million from a seed round led by CRE Venture Capital.\n\nCarry1st plans to enter new partnerships with global gaming studios. Their existing partnerships cut across continents: with Raketspel in Sweden, New York-based Cosi Games, and Ethiopian developer Qene Games.\n\nThey also intend to launch new games and scale existing ones. To achieve that, they plan to hire more staff for product, engineering, and growth. The strategy is welcome by their latest investors.\n\n\u201cAt Riot, we have seen first hand the importance of partnering with local experts to bring the best possible gaming experience to players,\u201d Brendan Mulligan, Head of Corporate Development at Riot Games, said.\n\n\u201cAs the number of gamers in Africa explodes, we\u2019re excited to work with Cordel and Carry1st as they introduce game developers from all over the world to an important and passionate audience.\u201d\n\nCarry1st could be an engine for driving the mobile gaming economy in Africa, tapping into a growing global wave.\n\n36% of all mobile app downloads in 2020 were mobile games, according to App Annie, the mobile apps analytics company. 70% of all app purchases on the Apple store and Google Play in 2020 was on games.\n\nThe upward trajectory in mobile game spend is set to continue this year, reaching $120 billion.",

          "text": "Lami, a Kenyan insurtech company democratizing insurance products and services for low-income Kenyans, has raised $1.8 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Accion Venture Lab.\n\nFounded by Jihan Abass in 2018, Lami is a digital insurance platform that enables partner businesses \u2013 including banks, tech companies, and other entities to easily and seamlessly offer digital insurance products to their users via its API.\n\nLami can also be used by partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs. Through its API, users can get a quotation for motor, medical, or other tailored insurance products in seconds, then customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit their needs. They get their policy documents instantly and claims are paid in record time.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal Abass said, \u201cSimilar to a payment API/gateway, we process insurance KYC, pricing of products, underwriting of products and claims processing in real time. Let me give you an example, Jumia wanted to launch an insurance marketplace but they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of integrating with every single insurance company and they didn\u2019t want to manage the process of issuing policies. Using our API because we have 20 insurance companies on our platform, they were able to launch this marketplace with a large number of products.\u201d\n\nJulian Abbas Founder & CEO\n\nThe Insurance space in Africa\n\nWith a 3% penetration rate (except for South Africa), Africa\u2019s insurance market is lagging behind. In Kenya where Lami is based less than 20% of the population has access to health insurance.\n\nThe major cause of the low adoption is that most insurance providers on the continent fail to offer flexible, affordable and tailored insurance coverage that can provide a safety net for the African consumer. For example, under most health policies customers face restrictions on what facilities and treatments are covered, they struggle to understand coverage terms and face complicated and lengthy claims processes. This results in a longer processing cycle, poor customer satisfaction, and higher distribution costs.\n\nLami\u2019s services are enabled by its flexible insurance rating engine and direct integration with several parties and insurance companies. Lami co-designs innovative products with its underwriting partners to enable businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base, with flexible options that meet their needs and cash flows, such as monthly medical policies for startup employees.\n\nLami\u2019s CEO Jihan Abass said, \u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more people, improving our technology, and growing our presence across Africa as we can continue to address the persistent insurance gap. At Lami, our vision is to help improve the financial resilience of millions by making insurance products more accessible and affordable for underserved populations. By enabling our business partners to offer customized insurance solutions, we are helping them provide more value to their customers, while enabling large volumes of users to access insurance, often for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe Lami team at work\n\nSince its inception, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies and has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer, and Madison Insurance, distributing more than 30 products available including medical, motor, employee benefits, and device insurance. As an innovator in the digital insurance space, Lami aims to continue diversifying its business by looking for new partners and building on its core technology.\n\nMichael Schlein, President and CEO, Accion Venture Lab, said, \u201cNinety-seven percent of Africans lack access to insurance \u2013 a financial safety net that can help them build resilience against economic shocks. Lami helps address this need for consumers across Africa through its innovative approach that leverages technology and partnerships to help any business develop and sell insurance.\u201d\n\nWithin the past month Malian insurtech OKO and Nigerian insurtech Curacel raised a combined amount of $1.6 million, Lami\u2019s funding news is a reminder that there\u2019s some activity in the African insurtech space. Also, with less than 5% of venture capital going to female-led startups in 2019, it\u2019s positive news to see another female-led company being funded.",

Prior to the Fair, the ventures will conduct strategy with the MBA cohort at Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. For the two days, the companies will receive networking opportunities, masterclasses, and mentorship. The Fair will culminate in a pitch competition where cash prizes will be awarded to the winners.\n\nThis pitch competition will be live streamed for conference attendees on Saturday, May 29, from 2 to 5 pm.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nComments",

          "text": "Nigerian fintech startup Paystack has announced its official expansion to one of Africa\u2019s largest markets, South Africa.\n\nFounded in 2015, by Shola Akinlade (CEO) and Ezra Olubi (CTO) Paystack uses its API to help businesses process payments, and with active operations in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nIn 2018, it raised $8 million Series A which it planned to use for its Ghana expansion. In October 2020, US payments giant, Stripe, acquired Paystack for $200 million, to open a huge route to the African market.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Paystack\u2019s South Africa expansion began with a six-month pilot phase that likely started a month after Stripe\u2019s acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring this phase, Paystack reportedly worked with different businesses and has grown a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome. Our pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s head of product expansion.\n\nBacked by US-based Stripe, the company plans to leverage Africa\u2019s growing online commerce sector.\n\nThe continent currently accounts for less than 3% of global eCommerce activities, and payments are just one part of several deep challenges that eCommerce faces in the continent. With the right approach, however, this could change drastically, and it seems Paystack is betting highly on that growth.\n\nCrunching numbers\n\nRecall that in 2018, Paystack claimed it powered 15% of all online payments and had 10,000 businesses on its platform. With a reported 60,000 businesses in 2021, the company now claims it powers up to 50% of all online payments in Nigeria.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the likes of MTN, SPAR, and UPS use Paystack\u2019s software to collect payments globally.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve not gotten official confirmation from Paystack on what it means by online payments, the Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBBS) reports that Nigeria processed $58 billion worth of online real-time interbank transactions in March 2021.\n\nEven if ATM and USSD transactions \u2014 which are part of the NIBBS data \u2014 are eliminated, this could still be leaving Paystack with payments transactions worth billions of dollars on a monthly basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStartups like Fluuterwave, Kuda also posted similarly massive numbers during their record-breaking fundraises. While such numbers give room for optimism, it leaves some questions unanswered.\n\nSlow and effective growth\n\nCompared to Flutterwave who is now present in 20 African countries, Paystack growth has been seemingly slower.\n\nAbdulrahman Jogbojogbo, product marketer at Paystack, explains to Techcrunch that the company\u2019s concern is not to have a lot of presence in countries at the expense of service quality. For him, each expansion requires \u201ccareful planning and lots of behind-the-scenes, foundational work.\u201d\n\nWith the country planning similar expansion to other African countries, Africa\u2019s payment space is set for some robust competition fueled by the likes of Paystack, Flutterwave, and Yoco. And that could be a good thing.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAre you building a startup business within Port Harcourt but struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Therefore, the way we think about university and the purpose of university must also change.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the role of technology in education and the role of technology in transforming lives. We cannot ignore that fact and continue to believe that it is not relevant.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge I am sure you will have to deal with is that of funding the university. Realistically, I don\u2019t think the government alone can fund universities. I think we should explore other means to make our universities viable.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, the University of Benin (UNIBEN) has produced more manpower than any other institution in the state. So, we have an interest and a stake.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it as a federal university; we see it as our own university. We will always do everything we can to support the institution. We have our own universities and we are going through the same challenges you just mentioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI received the result of the visitation panel of Ambrose Alli University, so I can imagine the kind of work you will have to deal with. Your track records speak for itself; if anyone can do the job, it\u2019s you. We have no doubt that you are going to do a thorough job,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nHe charged the panel to come up with recommendations that will help in strengthening the university to be more viable, adding that \u201call our institutions have suffered from a lack of a sense of accountability. It has disappeared from our universities. It is disappointing to see the level of corruption in some of our universities.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Amal Pepple said that they have a huge task ahead of them, as they have a 60-day duration to submit their report.\n\nPepple, however, thanked the governor for the rehabilitation of some of the link roads within the campus and the renovation of the university hostels, which was used as the Games village for the just concluded National Sports Festival, tagged Edo 2020.\n\n...",

          "text": "BY MUYIWA OYINLOLA\n\nAnnually, workers around the world celebrate the Workers Day on May 1st. The day is set aside to honour the struggles and gains made by workers and labourers. In Nigeria, this year\u2019s May Day celebration comes with mixed feeling for workers.\n\nAlthough it is a day for celebration, for many of the workers, it is not Uhuru yet, as the struggle for an improved livelihood has not gotten any better since then. Several states are still struggling to pay the National minimum wage of N30,000 over two years after it was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThis year\u2019s celebration was marked amidst various contending issues such as; nonpayment of salaries and pension, insecurity, unilateral sack of workers, hike in cost of living and other issues that has to do with dearth in good governance and workers welfare. Labour has consistently been at loggerheads with government over this. The Parliamentary Staff Union of Nigeria, the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) and the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) are all on strike over poor welfare.\n\n\u201cThere has never been anything that Labour got on a platter of gold since the history of the labour movement in Nigeria,\u201d NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said. For the Nigeria Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), The major challenge for workers is the insecurity.\n\nNUEE general secretary, comrade Joe Ajaero says, \u201cThe safety of our Workers who carry out the maintenance works and man the stations in these restive areas are seriously threatened, as some run into dens of bandits and kidnappers while navigating the bushes to repair and maintain faulty Lines.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cShould this alarming rate of insecurity continue in the next few weeks with the devastating effect on our members, we may not have any other option than to withdraw our members from further exposure to security threats, which has taken many lives already.\u201d\n\nAmidst concern that the minimum wage will be removed from the Exclusive list to the Concurrent list, Minster of labour and Employment, Chris Ngige used this year\u2019s May Day to reassure workers that such will not happen. He indicated, \u201cThat law is a national law, it\u2019s not that which you can choose for anybody that falls within the ambit of that law.\n\nIt is not a question of pick and choose. We moved the national minimum wage from N18,000 per month to N30,000, it is an irreducible clause and we need a social protection mechanism. \u201cWe therefore expect the states and people in the private sector to comply.\n\nAmendment of trying to expand that law or trying to bring the law into the concurrent list of the institution will not work.\u201d Nigerian workers should not give up. Indeed, as the popular slogan goes, \u201cA luta continua; vit\u00f3ria \u00e9 certa\u201d.",

          "text": "By Jonathan Nda- Isaiah |\n\nOcto5 Holdings Limited, a developers and managers has said that the company is actively addressing concerns raised about the management of the Ocean Bay estate.\n\nThe company added that as a responsible corporate citizen, it had over the last eighteen months been actively addressing all the issues raised by the Residents\u2019 Association as an essential pillar of its vision to create wholesome urban communities.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja on Wednesday, the CEO of Octo5 Holdings, Mr Jide Odusolu said \u201cas a company dedicated to building conducive communities for residents and one committed to their wellbeing, we have consistently delivered value despite challenges encountered\u201d.\n\nHe added that though 2020 was particularly turbulent, intertwined with the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, his company had remained unwavering in its determination to ensure that Ocean Bay Estate remains a unique and wholesome community.\n\nContinuing the chat with journalists, Odusolu said just as alluded by some residents of the estate, Ocean Bay is a mini-Nigeria which just like the Nation at large, as a maturing community developed over fifteen years ago, has many challenges.\n\nNonetheless, he stated that his company was proud to have created a unique haven that houses over 300 residents with continued improvements.\n\nHe said, Ocean Bay Estate is one of few communities in Nigeria, where the developer has consistently funded all estate improvement works without putting any financial pressure on residents to make capital contributions beyond insisting they pay their service charges and utility bills.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that the only other payment that anyone makes applies to property investors and homeowners who pay a mandatory one-time infrastructure connection fee to connect their houses to the infrastructure services grid provided and maintained by his company for the estate.\n\nHe lamented that unfortunately many residents, including the Residents Association Chairman, were in the habit of not paying their service dues and utility charges often hiding under the pretext of displeasure with service quality.\n\nFor example, he asserted that between June 2019 and now, Octo5 had expended over NGN 150m on overhauling the estate water grid, yet a number of the residents refused to pay the monthly charge for water and had to be disconnected from the mains.\n\nHe wondered how someone that was disconnected and ostensibly not making use of the estate water supply could possibly comment on the water quality.\n\nCommenting particularly on issues of power supply, the Octo5 CEO said the company had been a serial victim of PHCN (now EKEDC) abuse of power.\n\nAccording to him, the 24 hour power supply for which the estate was renowned was only possible using a blended mix of diesel generators and epileptic power supply from EKEDC under a willing buyer-willing seller arrangement at a rate much higher than the public tariff. He explained that when in December, EKEDC unilaterally attempted to increase tariffs and back-charge the estate with a spurious excessive claim, it resulted in a dispute as the management company in charge of the estate refused to pay and instead submitted evidence of past payments to EKEDC. Unfortunately, EKEDC unilaterally disconnected the estate in February after a two day notice.\n\nAccording to him, Octo5 recognizing itself as the utility owner accepted it was its duty to address the issue and immediately purchased a brand new 1MVA diesel generator in addition to existing 500KVA and 800KVA generators it had earlier procured to enable it to provide a short term solution.\n\nThe company also simultaneously invested in a gas-powered captive power plant for permanent solution to the power debacle.\n\nOdusolu stated that despite the huge cost being incurred running the estate exclusively on diesel generators since February, his company had maintained the same tariff in place and only adjusted operating hours from 24 hour supply to an average of 21 hours daily power supply for the interim period.\n\nSpeaking further, Odusolu said; \u201cWe recognise that our residents are used to the unique ambiance and services of the estate which is why most of them continue to live in the estate. A large number of residents have been tenants in the estate for over six years and never moved out while others who are homeowners have lived in the estate for over 10 years now. It is my greatest joy being able to see an estate that was merely a concept come alive\u201d.\n\nQuestioned about a recent media visit to the Ocean Bay Estate, during which residents raised concerns with security and other issues in the estate, Odusolu asserted that these concerns have already been addressed and that efforts to disturb public peace in the estate are ill-advised.\n\n\u201cWe have tried and will keep trying hard to make improvements through Octo5 Utilities (OBCSL), our facilities/utility arm. It is shocking to hear people like Messrs Odeabeatu and Orbih both of whom were part of the committee that selected the current security company guarding the estate claim to be unsafe.\u201d he added; saying he finds it alarming that an estate which has been sustained for over fifteen years was being attacked by a few residents, whose motives are clearly questionable.\n\nFielding questions on why he chose to address the media, Mr Odusolu said; \u201cwe are compelled to address the media in this manner to counter misrepresentations and outright lies in the public space and welcome any media house to visit the estate to see for themselves and independently rate the quality of security, power, water and road networks provided and maintained by us\u201d.\n\nThe developer said Octo5 remains undeterred and would keep moving forward with the various upgrades which include a recently completed 250meter external storm water drainage and an ongoing 800 meter community road, all being funded by Octo5 exclusively.\n\nHe again lamented that despite numerous efforts by Octo5 Holdings to partner with the Ocean Bay Residents Association executives by providing unfettered access by its executives; involving them in the decision-making process leading up to the selection of a new security company; carrying them along on actions being taken to address the power challenges and several similar interventions, a few residents have decided to carry out a campaign of calumny against the company and its officers.",

          "text": "Organized Labour yesterday condemned and rejected plans by the federal government to slash workers\u2019 salaries, warning that such a careless statement could set the nation\u2019s on fire.\n\nLabour in a statement by the President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Finance to order before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements.\n\nReacting to the statement credited to the Finance Minister that the Federal Government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers, NLC expressed shock with such utterance.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIt is almost unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cIt was with huge shock that we read the statement credited to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who said that the Federal Government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers.\n\n\u2018\u2019Minister was reported to have said this in Abuja at a policy dialogue on corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Minister was also reported to have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to immediately review the salaries of civil servants and the number of federal agencies in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is almost unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time.\n\nThe question to ask is \u2018which salary is government planning to slash?\u2019 \u2018\u2019It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30,000 which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice.\n\nThe proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay!\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the multiple devaluations of the Naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria has knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across the board.\n\n\u2018\u2019Nigerian workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth. Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cThis call for salary slash by Mrs. Zainab Ahmed is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers. It is most uncharitable, most insensitive, most dehumanizing and most barbaric. Nigerian workers demand an immediate retraction and apology by the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Finance to order now before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pastor Adeboye\u2019s son, Dare dies at 42\n\nIf there is any salary that needs serious slashing, it is the humungous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders in Nigeria who do very little but collect so much! \u201cWorkers generate surplus value and revenue for the government.\n\nWe do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance! It is also important to make the point that salaries are products of contracts governed by laws. They cannot be unilaterally adjusted.\n\nPalliatives to help their people through the terrible socio-economic dislocations occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be completely absurd for the Nigerian government to be thinking of salary slash. \u2018\u2019This move is not only at great odds with global best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is also in violation of relevant ILO Conventions and Declarations on Wages and Decent Work.\n\n\u201cWe urge Government as a social partner to quickly respond to the demands by Labour for an upward review of salaries of all Nigerian workers. Nigerian workers have shown sufficient understanding with the government through the tough patches of the pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2019Now, Nigerian workers demand reciprocity of our understanding. Nigerian workers demand an increase in their remunerations and allowances. Enough is enough!\u201d",

Not only this government, even during Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they deny it,\u201d he said.\n\nObasanjo urged the government to develop a means to deal with kidnappers and bandits, instead of pampering them with ransom payment.\n\n\u201cSome people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a blunder. This is because paying a ransom encourages others to do the same. If you don\u2019t want to pay the ransom, you\u2019ll need to be prepared to deal with it aggressively. To deal with it, you need a stick,\u201d he said.\n\nRumours of ransom payment had emerged in several negotiations between the Buhari administration and Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pastor Adeboye\u2019s son, Dare dies at 42\n\nThere were also speculations of ransom payments in negotiations between state governments and terrorists.\n\nThe Buhari government was said to have paid ransom to secure the release of both the Chibok and the Dapchi schoolgirls.\n\nThe Chibok schoolgirls were kidnapped on 14 April 2014 during Jonathan\u2019s era.\n\nBut four years later, Buhari had his own dose of kidnapping, when the Dapchi girls were captured in February 2018 in Yobe state.\n\nLess than a month after, the girls were released, with one of them, Leah Sharibu held back.\n\nRansom was suspected, but the Buhari administration vehemently denied it.",

          "text": "Chief Bode George, a former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has claimed that if Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, is elected President of Nigeria in 2023, he will tear his passport.\n\n\u201cThe truth has only one face, one color, and one reality,\u201d the PDP chieftain said in a speech to PDP members in Lagos State.\n\nIt is on this foundation that we will embark on the difficult task of rescuing our state from the greedy clutches of the Iragbiji usurper and finally pushing ahead on the path to our collective national salvation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt amuses me when I see mercenary pretenders prancing around the Nigerian vacuum, dreaming of a flimsy presidential ambition. Yes, they are hallucinating because their goals are off.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Minority Caucus: We have not heard from our President despite daily killings\n\n\u201cEven as every corner of the country is challenged by variegated insecurities ranging from banditry, urban outlaws, rogue herdsmen, destructive fissiparous forces, the murderous Boko Haram terrorists and sundry insidious elements \u2013 the basic priority of all right-thinking patriots should be about restoring peace and harmony among our people rather than the mercantile pursuit of a chimerical presidential bid.\n\nThis is what is called true statesmanship. This is what is called discerning, progressive leadership.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the excessive centralization of power is destroying the progress of the country. He described political office holders who are embezzling funds meant for everyone as greedy.\n\nIn his speech titled \u201cNigeria: Time to Chart a New Direction\u201d, Chief George said, \u201cThe Nigerian polity is now straying towards its elastic limit. It is now over-stressed and over-stretched beyond the bounds of acceptability. Our survival as a nation is genuinely being questioned from the desert to the sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cViolence sprouts everywhere from the distant outpost of Ajangbadi in Lagos to the farthest reaches of Malum-Fatori in Borno, from Ki\u1e63i in Oke-Ogun to Odiani in the swamps of Delta- our nation gradually descends into a dangerous gangland where the rule of the bayonet and clubs seems to be the norm.\n\nSurely, we can\u2019t continue like this. Our survival as a people is to reverse the ruinous course and retrieve ourselves from the gaping chasm that confronts us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the time to change the path of old, to look beyond what hobbles our progress, to redefine our value system, to rejig and restructure the various anomalies that presently hinder the greater possibilities of the Nigerian Union.\u201d\n\nOther dignitaries in attendance included the Secretary, Southwest PDP, Hon Rahman Owokoniran; former Lagos State deputy governor, Chief Kofoworola Bucknor-Akerele, Chief Remi Akitoye, and Chief Mrs Onikepo Oshodi.\n\n\u201cour political culture is still much engrossed in the glorification of cronyism over intellect, the celebration of charlatans over patriotic commitment, the narrow worship of the gains of the moment over the truth and the base withdrawal into nepotistic laager over the greater good.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd our nation is losing an estimated 29 billion dollars every year due to epileptic power supply. This is not sustainable. Electrical Power is the very life-blood of all industrial revolution. It is the fuel of all economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cA nation without efficient power supply cannot rise into the bright dawn of the digital civilization. It is stuck forever in the bleak dark side of economic underdevelopment and teeters inevitably on economic ruination.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, something must give way to spur a Nigerian rebirth and renewal lest we become the permanent invalid giant of Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo change cause, to redefine our path, we must cultivate the essential ingredients of meritocracy as the critical building blocks of modern nations. Wherever young, vibrant, intelligent minds are given pride of place to steer the destinies of their nations, such societies invariably are widening the opportunities for competitive growth, encouraging a healthy contest of ideas, strengthening their developmental advantages.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur young men and women excelling from the tundra of Russia to Saint Albert in Canada are symbols of our great possibilities if only we do the right things; If only we encourage knowledge and be kind to talent; If only we disregard the narrow province of nepotism and embrace merit regardless of its origin.\n\n\u201cOurs is now a bullion van democracy where characters of blemished, dubious identities have virtually seized our collective coffers, turning a people\u2019s treasury into a private family vault.\n\n\u201cLagos State, my much trampled state which a writer recently referred to as a zombie state is perhaps the best example of a seized and conquered territory where an Iragbiji native dwells like an obscene Persian monarch determining who becomes a councillor, who becomes a local government chairman, who becomes a house of Assemblymember, who becomes a Representative, a Senator and a Governor.\n\n\u201cAll these he does by compromising all the agencies and organs of the state, including the warped electoral commission itself.\n\n\u201cLeadership is a product of training, experience and learning. It is a process not an instant, immediate arrival. Leadership requires a lot of patience, cultivated wisdom and demonstrated intelligence. You do not aspire to a position of leadership by mere whim and fancy. Like the Boy Scout motto says: You must be prepared. You must be honourable. You must look beyond personal advantages and be willing to make sacrifices on behalf of others. This is what the current political practice lacks.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, I must return to my state again in view of the self-serving, dubious, incongruous legislation that seeks to shield the looters of our state treasury from the prosecutorial mandate of the EFCC.\n\nAccording to records, in the year 2020, the Alpha Beta company which is owned by Bola Tinubu raked in about 37 billion naira from our treasury without lifting a finger. If this is not sheer daylight robbery, I wonder what is?",

          "text": "Following the ravaging insecurity in the country, the House of Representatives yesterday called on the federal government to suspend the upcoming census exercise until security improved. The House also said it will be counter-productive and a waste of scarce financial resources to conduct such exercise amidst the economic recession.\n\nThe call was made on the heel of a motion under matters of urgent public importance titled \u201cCall on the federal government of Nigeria to Suspend the Proposed 2021 Population and Housing Census to be conducted by the National Population Commission\u201d sponsored by Shelia Barwa Bell. Moving the motion, Bell said that the state of insecurity would not guarantee accuracy if the census was conducted now, arguing that many Nigerians have fled their homes and villages. He said: \u201cThe federal government of Nigeria through the National Population Commission has commenced preparations for 2021 population and housing census across the country.\n\n\u201cThe State of insecurity in Nigeria has displaced numerous citizens who are duellers of the various communities to be captured in the exercise. \u201cSome displaced persons have crossed over to neighbouring countries for refuge and cannot be captured if the census is to be conducted. \u201cThe overwhelming security challenges at hand, expecting accuracy in any census conducted now would be like passing an elephant through the eyes of a needle. \u201cIn the circumstances, a large chunk of Nigerians have fled their homes, while many others are being held under captive by kidnappers.

          "title": "Cement prices hit N4500 in Nigeria\u2019s SouthEast",
          "text": "A market survey in the region shows that block makers are shutting down\n\nBy Our Reporters\n\nCement prices have increased by 67-100 per cent in the South East states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, hitting as high as N4,500 in Abakaliki.\n\nA market survey conducted by NAN at various wholesale and retail shops in the zone shows that the price of the product has increased almost by 100 % when compared to the price in 2020.\n\nA cement dealer at Kenyatta Market in Enugu State capital, Mr Ifeanyi Amadi said the increase in the product\u2019s price started last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increase in dollar exchange.\n\nHe noted that a trailer load of Dangote cement with 600 bags initially sold at N1.5 million in 2020 but is now N2.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother retailer at Uwani, Samuel Uwakwe, said he was surprised at the rate prices of the product in the country.\n\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\n\nUwakwe lamented that few individuals were given opportunity to supply the product and pleaded with suppliers to reduce the prices and make it available for the citizens.\n\nHe maintained that the prices would likely crash during raining season.\n\nA block maker, Mr Albert Okechukwu noted that increase in the price of the product affected his business as he still sold six-inch and nine-inch block at N170 and N180 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is the same price we sold last year and it is same till date because we cannot change prices in order to retain our customers but most block industries have reduced quality of their blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nA site Engineer, Mr Emma Ugwuoke said he wanted to start a building in the village when the price was N2,800 last year but was waiting to see if it would come down.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back next time, I was told it was N3, 000 and to my greatest surprise, they sell N3,900 and N4,000 now in my village.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing one can do than to buy it like that. I want government to do something urgently about it because it is frustrating buying cement at that price,\u201d Ugwuoke said.\n\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\n\nThose who spoke to NAN said the price hike had further dashed the hope of many Nigerians, wishing to own their personal homes.\n\nA businessman, Mr Victor Ugwu, said he had to suspend his building project because of the \u201cunfortunate development\u201d.\n\nUgwu said: \u201cI have stopped my project for now. I cannot afford to continue with the current price of the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe economy is very bad so I hope to wait until there is a drop in the price.\n\n\u201cI think the hike can be attributed to the monopoly being enjoyed by the cement producers in the country. Unfortunately, there may not be any respite until that monopoly is broken.\u201d\n\nHowever, a cement dealer, Mr James Ogbonna, said the problem had nothing to do with the manufacturers of the commodity.\n\nRather, Ogbonna blamed the price hike on the activities of \u201cshylock distributors\u201d of cement.\n\nHe said that the hike had affected his business adversely, adding that cement patronage had been at the lowest ebb, since the price hike.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first and second week of March, we sold a bag for N3,200, but within the third week we started selling at N3,500.\n\n\u201cBy the end of March, the price moved up to N4,000 and now, we sell between N4,000 and N4100, depending on the brand.\u201d\n\nAnother dealer, Mr Godwin Okafor, said that his sales had dropped drastically as a result of the hike.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of challenges in this cement business now. When we make deposit and order for the goods, it takes about one month before we get delivery,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in Awka in Anambra as stakeholders decry the situation.\n\nMr Kenechukwu Okoye, a cement dealer along Zik Avenue, Awka said before the #EndSARS protest in 2020, a 50kg bag of cement was sold at N2,500.\n\n\u201cShortly after the #EndSARS, the price rose to N3,000 and from there to the present price of N4,000 and N4,100, we are selling today,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye said though the distributors initially blamed the problem on difficulties encountered by the hauling firm transporting the product, the situation had come to stay.\n\nIn Owerri, Imo capital, price of cement is between N3,850 and N4300, depending on the brand.\n\nAt the Building Materials Market in Naze, Owerri North Local Government Area, Dangote and BUA cement are sold at N4,000 per bag while BUA and UNICEM are sold for N3,900.\n\nMr Okechukwu Okonya, a seller, said the cost could be attributed to high cost of transportation as a result of fuel price.\n\nOkonya also said major dealers sometimes hoard the product in their warehouses to create artificial scarcity.\n\nAnother trader, Mr Marcel Iwu, agreed that although there had been hoarding by major dealers, manufacturers had also complained of increased cost of raw materials.\n\nIwu added that the prices could go higher or reduce at any given time, noting that even if prices fall, traders would want to sell off their old stock at higher rates.\n\nIn Abakaliki, Ebonyi, prices of almost all building materials have gone up.\n\nThe prices of cement, rods of various sizes, corrugated roofing sheets and other building materials and accessories according to NAN findings have been on the increase since January.\n\nThe price of Dangote and Bua which sold at N2,500 earlier in November and December 2020 now sold between N4000 and N4500.\n\nSimilarly, Unicem cement which also sold at N2,300 within the same period had also gone up to N4,000 and N4,300.\n\nMr John Okoh, a cement dealer at Kpiri-Kpiri market in an interview with NAN attributed the development to lack of price control mechanism and high rate of exchange rate of the Naira against the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe development is indeed affecting sales and business because many builders have put a stop to their building and other construction projects because they cannot cope with the present high cost of the product.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Clement Igbo, who owns a block moulding factory, said that the high cost of cement was hampering production, saying that he no longer produced maximally due to lack of buyers.\n\n\u201cA bag of Dangote cement which is one of the best products for our business is selling for N4500 and it is difficult to buy at this prevailing price and make enough production.\n\n\u201cWe sell six inch and nine-inch block before this price increase at N150 and N200 but now 6 inch-block is sold at N220 while the 9-inch sells for between N250 and N300 respectively.\n\n\u201cMany block industries in the town have closed down production while some have compromised standard which pose great dangers to the building industry,\u201d Igbo said.\n\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\nMr Jerry Onwe, an economic activist urged the Federal and state governments to revive moribund cement factories across the states to meet the increasing demands of cement consumption in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the quest for mass housing for poor Nigerians would remain elusive if urgent steps were not taken to address the high cost of building materials in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where an average worker earns N30,000 monthly as take-home wage, how can such a person afford a house of his own in view of the prevailing price of building materials?\n\n\u201cWe have reached a cross road as far as the issue of building materials is concerned and this is a time for government to intervene and bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",
          "summary": "\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",

He is a folly.\n\n\u201cThis is because when you pay ransom, you encourage; but if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe added, \u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during (Goodluck) Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they denied it.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who condemned the security challenges in the country, insisted that 2023 must mark a watershed for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe year 2023 should give us the beginning of the emergence of a new federation. Feeling that the rot continues, then we are going to be sliding back to a ground dissolution. God forbid,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting It Right\n\nObasanjo decried that those beating drums of division in the country do not think about the interest of the minority ethnic groups.\n\nHe explained that the minority ethnic groups face oppression and extermination should Nigeria be allowed to break as being agitated by some people.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we will get it right in Nigeria, any leader must look at Nigeria with the prism of the diversity of Nigeria. For as long as you look at Nigeria with the prism of your ethnic group, then you are not going anywhere, either your ethnic group or religious group.\n\n\u201cBut is there hope? There is hope,\u201d the elder statesman stated.\n\nIn his remarks, Professor Gundu told informed his host that people were being maimed in their sleep and on their ancestral land, stressing the need for influential Nigerians to rise to the occasion to stem the tide of killings in the land.\n\n\u201cNigeria seems to be losing the battle against insecurity,\u201d he said while demanding full compensation for victims of killings and destruction in Tiv land.\n\nThe leader of the delegation also sought the proscription of armed Fulani groups and intensified advocacy against nomadic pastoralism.\n\n\u201cThere are different shades of instability in the country. Nigeria is truly bleeding to death. There\u2019s even a population fault line that could lead to the \u2018Lebanon Trap\u2019.\n\n\u201cAll patriots must stand together; but if others have to be enslaved before the country can survive, we will prefer, as Tiv people, to take our destiny in our hands,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Anti-government protests took place across Colombia for the eighth straight day on Wednesday, as rights groups continue to raise concerns about excessive violence by security forces.\n\nRiot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators from the main public square in the capital, Bogota, at around 3pm (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday, as well as in other parts of the city where people had assembled.\n\nBut the protesters have said they will continue to take to the streets, despite right-wing President Ivan Duque withdrawing the contentious tax reform that pushed them to protest in the first place last week.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019ve withdrawn the reform, but they haven\u2019t changed it,\u201d said 48-year-old emerald trade union worker, Olga Cabos, who took part in the second national strike since April 28 in downtown Bogota.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let this government of Duque continue to keep making things harder for the poorest of us,\u201d she told Al Jazeera, brandishing an anti-government placard.\n\nThe protests were sparked by an unpopular tax reform that the government said aimed to stabilise an economy ravished by the coronavirus pandemic. But working- and middle-class Colombians said the plan favoured the rich while placing more pressure on them.\n\nDuque withdrew the proposal on Sunday and his finance minister resigned a day later, but the protesters are now calling for a withdrawal of a proposed health reform and a guaranteed basic income of one million pesos ($260) for all Colombians, among other demands.\n\n\u201cAlthough the tax reform was the initial spark, current protests in Colombia reflect a wide range of social, political and economic grievances that the Duque government will be hard-pressed to address with existing scripts for national dialogue,\u201d said Arlene Tickner, a political science professor at Bogota\u2019s Rosario University.\n\nViolence increased late on Monday in the country\u2019s third-largest city, Cali, where protesters said police opened fire to disperse the crowds. Videos of police misconduct in Cali \u2013 which Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify \u2013 were shared widely on social media on Tuesday.\n\nOn-the-ground sources said police indiscriminately shot at demonstrators, even from helicopters.\n\nThe death toll related to the protests remains widely disputed and wide-ranging between the government and independent NGOs. Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman says 24 people have died, while local NGO Temblores, which documents police abuse, estimates that 37 have been killed.\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest against President Ivan Duque\u2019s government in Medellin [Joaquin Sarmiento/AFP]\n\nThere have been reports of looting and vandalism during some of the protests and those acts have been condemned by local politicians.\n\nDisturbances worsened in Bogota on Tuesday evening, with 30 civilians and 16 police officers injured, the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement, adding that a mob tried to \u201cburn alive\u201d 10 police officers by setting fire to a small police station.\n\nMeanwhile, various United States officials, the United Nations and the European Union have denounced the national police force for opening fire on demonstrators. Celebrities, including Colombia-born musician Shakira \u2013 who has been known to steer clear of commenting on political issues \u2013 have also spoken out about the violence.\n\n\u201cI ask the government of my country to take urgent measures now to stop the violation of human rights and restore the value of human life above any political interest,\u201d the singer tweeted in Spanish on Tuesday.\n\nBut according to Tickner, \u201cgrowing international pressure to stop police brutality and respect human rights has had little effect on state-executed violence and accountability\u201d so far.\n\nIn a video on Wednesday, Duque repeated government allegations that illegal armed groups are engaging in acts of vandalism and looting and he said more than 550 arrests had been made.\n\n\u201cThere will be no truce with those who commit these crimes \u2013 all of society will take them to justice,\u201d Duque said.\n\nThe president had earlier urged a national dialogue \u201cto listen and construct solutions\u201d ahead of the marches, similar to that of 2019, when Colombians had taken to the streets over economic inequality, a slow implementation of the peace process and rising insecurity.\n\nElizabeth Dickinson, a senior Colombia analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that although illegal groups may have in some cases infiltrated the current protests, \u201cthere is no way you could credibly claim that any armed or criminal group is motivating or coercing protesters to the street\u201d.\n\n\u201cHere in the capital Bogota, the number of people living in extreme poverty has tripled in just a year, so this is a real moment of social crisis across the country and I think the protests could be more enduring than in 2019.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Sergio Guzman, a political analyst who runs the firm Colombia Risk Analysis, said many of the protesters\u2019 demands are unrealistic \u2013 and will not be welcomed by the Duque government.\n\n\u201cDemands such as universal basic income are not feasible under any scenario,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that the protesters have yet to establish a negotiating position that would be considered realistic or acceptable by the government, either.\n\nHowever, he said the government needs to start addressing more of the protesters\u2019 concerns, especially police brutality.\n\nDickinson agreed and also said both sides are currently very entrenched in their positions.\n\n\u201cProtesters\u2019 demands are really growing by the day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a list of very significant changes for the state and for right or wrong, they would entail very significant, deep reforms to the way that the state functions.\u201d",

The first one is the award of a contract for design, manufacturing and supply of critical spare parts for Crompton Greaves 330 kV, 132 kV and 33 kV circuit breakers to Messrs. Legen Engineering Nigeria Limited in the sum of N298,339,887.04.\n\n\u201cThe second one is the award of the contract for the procurement of 50 sets of 400 AH battery banks, 30 to 50 volts and 30 number of 110-volt battery charges for the substation used by the TCN in favour of Messrs. DTS Transformers Electric Industry Limited at the sum of N644,805,953.10.\n\n\u201cThe third award of the contract is for the procurement of 50 cents also of 132 kV isolators for the TCN in favour of Messrs. Leading Diagonal Engineering Nigeria Limited in the sum of $840,650 plus N53,900,000 within the delivery period of six months.\n\n\u201cThe fourth one is the award of the contract for the design, manufacturing and the supply of three 60/66 MVA 132kV power transformers with accessories and 15 number of 500 kV transformers, 33/0.415kV earthing transformers for the TCN in favour of Messrs. Zhenjiang Transformers Company Limited, in the sum of N1,296,953,044.55 with a delivery period of 12 months.\n\n\u201cThe fifth one is the award of the contract for the design, supply and installation of Optical Wire (OPGW) and Universal Optical Transportation Network System (OTN) for some critical transmission lines in favour of Messrs. Xinjiang Power and Transportation Company Limited in the sum of $6,800,743.51, plus N668,843,634.74, with a delivery period of 12 months.\n\n\u201cThe last one is the upward review of the contraction for the design, manufacture, supply, installation and commissioning of 1X 100MVA, 132/33kV power transformers at Ogba Transmission Substation, Lagos, in favour of Messrs. Power Control and Appliances Limited, in the sum of $648,038.31, plus N48,342,524.18, with the delivery period of six months.\n\n\u201cAll these procurements are geared towards upgrades of the transmission system, to the national grid, so that we can have sufficient power supply to the nation\u201d.\n\nThe minister added that the federal government will soon begin the second phase of the free distribution of four million pre-paid electricity meters to Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government is almost through with the distribution of one million free pre-free paid meters to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe have almost finished with phase zero, we are now going into phase one of the distribution of the meters, that is the remaining four million the central bank promised to augment with.\n\n\u201cThe first set is one million, we are about to finish with that, but you know, it is not the target, one million is very negligible compared to the demand of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if there was any improvement in power generation, Saleh said: \u201cWe are improving, it (power generation) has improved, you can see, I don\u2019t have to tell you.\n\n\u201cWe are moving from 3,000 megawatts, today we are generating up to 5,000 megawatts or over that, so it is a great improvement.\u201d\n\nThe minister stated that government was making sure that power supply was stable and also working towards upgrading the supply \u201cfrom say 4000 megawatts to 5,000 to 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts and so on.\n\n\u201cSo, the more we replace some obsolete and outdated equipment, the more we improve the supply of electricity.\u201d\n\nAsked if he agreed with the report that over 70 per cent of Nigerians who have electricity supply have less than 12 hours a day, he said: \u201cIt all depends. You know we have graded the supply based on the metering.\n\n\u201cUnless the meters are sufficient, we will not know which and where to push 24 hours supplies because there are some people who are ready for 24 hours and there are those who are not ready for 24 hours supply of light.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Organised labour under the auspices of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Wednesday condemned the moves by the federal government to review payrolls as part of measures to reduce the cost of governance.\n\nIt expressed concerns that the planned review, listed on Tuesday by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, as part of a directive by President Muhammed Buhari to cut costs in view of dwindling revenue may lead to slashing workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe NLC President, Dr. Ayuba Wabba, said in a statement yesterday that it would be absurd for the federal government to be thinking of a salary slash.\n\nHe said instead of contemplating a reduction in salaries, the government, as a social partner should respond to the demands by labour for an upward review of salaries.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIt was with huge shock that we read the statement credited to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who said that the federal government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers.\u201d\n\nNLC described the call for salary slash as a \u2018mass suicide\u2019 wish for Nigerian workers.\n\nIt demanded an immediate retraction and apology from the minister.\n\nThe NLC called on Buhari to \u201ccall the Minister of Finance to order now before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements.\u201d\n\nIt added that if any salary should be slashed, it was the humungous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders.\n\nNLC said it would be most unthinkable that the government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of workers at this time.\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is \u2018which salary is the government planning to slash? It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30,000, which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice! The proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay,\u201d it added.\n\nNLC said it was public knowledge that the multiple devaluation of the naira in a short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria had eroded the value of workers\u2019 incomes.\n\nAccording to the NLC, workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth.\n\nIt said: \u201cIndeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce a salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cWe do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance! It is also important to make the point that salaries are products of contracts governed by laws. They cannot be unilaterally adjusted.\n\n\u201cWhile many countries of the world are increasing the salaries of their workforce, extending social security coverage for their citizens and providing all forms of palliatives to help their people through the terrible socio-economic dislocations occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be completely absurd for the Nigerian government to be thinking of salary slash.\n\n\u201cThis move is not only at great odds with global best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also in violation of relevant ILO Conventions and Declarations on Wages and Decent Work.\n\n\u201cWe urge government as a social partner to quickly respond to the demands by labour for an upward review of salaries of all Nigerian workers. Nigerian workers have shown sufficient understanding with the government through the tough patches of the pandemic. Now, Nigerian workers demand reciprocity of our understanding. Nigerian workers demand an increase in their remunerations and allowances. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
