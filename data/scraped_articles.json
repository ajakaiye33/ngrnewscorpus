          "title": "South South govs, PANDEF blast Lai Mohammed over statement on banditry, kidnapping",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Soni Daniel, Northern Region Editor, Festus Ahon & Davies Iheamnachor\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said yesterday that prosecution of kidnappers and bandits was not federal government\u2019s responsibility but that of states.\n\nMohammed, who stated this at a briefing in Abuja, was reacting to claims by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, that the government was not doing enough to stem the tide of terrorism, banditry and kidnapping across the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe PDP accused this Federal Government of not engaging and of running a government of exclusion, forgetting, conveniently, that this government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\n\n\u201cThe town hall meeting series, which we launched in 2016, has so far been held 18 times across Nigeria. It\u2019s always a no-holds-barred opportunity for the government to engage with critical stakeholders, briefing them on government policies and programmes and getting their feed backs, thus ensuring inclusion and deepening of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe latest of such town hall meetings was the one in Kaduna. I will go ahead and read the 10-point recommendations from that Town Hall Meeting, and you can then judge for yourself who is ahead of the other.\n\n\u201cNow, we have gone a step further. We have taken those resolutions to the National Economic Council, NEC, chaired by the Vice President, and which also includes all the state governors.\n\n\u201cAs a prelude to adopting the recommendations, the NEC has directed all state governors to organize state-wide consultation on them, and then revert to the council in its next meeting.\n\n\u201cYou can now see that the PDP was more interested in playing politics with national challenges than helping to find solutions to them. They presented as original thinking some of the same resolutions that we are already working to implement, without a single reference to those same recommendations that emanated from our town hall meeting of April 8, 2021.\n\n\u201cThey disparaged the President and the Federal Government, engaged in name calling and finger-pointing, gloated about the security challenges facing the nation, lied about how they resolved security challenges under their watch and then went ahead to say, at their hysterical press conference, that they have not come to play politics. Who is fooling who here?\n\n\u201cThe PDP alleged that kidnappers and bandits are not being brought to justice. This is apparently aimed at the Federal Government. It is shocking that a party that ruled this nation for all of 16 years does not know that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offences.\n\nREAD ALSO: Security services trailing those plotting to destabilise Nigeria \u2014 Lai Mohammed\n\n\u201cThe PDP should, therefore, call out the states, including those being controlled by it to ensure a rigorous prosecution of arrested kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, PDP conveniently forgot that as far as terrorism, a federal offence, is concerned, this Federal Government has successfully prosecuted thousands of Boko Haram members in Kainji, as part of a continuing exercise. We are now seeking the cooperation of the judiciary to continue with the trial of arrested terrorists.\u2019\u2019\n\nFG wrong on this \u2014 Gov Okowa\n\nBut reacting to the minister\u2019s statement, chairman of South-South Governors Forum and governor of Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, who spoke through the State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, said: \u201cWe understand that terrorism is not a small crime; it\u2019s a crime against the nation not even the particular state where it happens. So we want to believe that may be the man is being misquoted.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government cannot say they are not in a position to do so. What is most important, even beyond the prosecution, is to prevent because prosecution is when it has happened. What we are saying is that as a government, what do we do to ensure that there is no terrorism, banditry, kidnapping and all that in our country?\n\n\u201cFor us, that is much more important than the issue of who prosecutes who. If we are able to bring back our country to the path of peace like it used to in the 80s and 90s; it will be better for all of us, both those at the federal and the state levels.\n\n\u201cSo, we all must be put hands together to ensure that terrorism, banditry and kidnapping are wiped out of our country.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who are at the state level, we have a responsibility when there is information to give to Intelligence if it is available to us but we do know that the security of the nation at that level is highly much more with the central government.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s position unacceptable\u2014 PANDEF\n\nAlso reacting, the Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, lambasted the minister over his statement, saying it was the responsibility of the federal government to provide security for Nigerians.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, said in Port Harcourt that the statement is unacceptable and a mark of irresponsibility .\n\nRobinson said: \u201cIt is an irresponsible statement from the minister. The federal government is the federal government of Nigeria, so it is wrong to say that it is not their responsibility to prosecute criminal elements.\n\n\u201cEven the constitution explicitly says that it is the responsibility of the government. We can\u2019t be talking about bandits when internal security is under the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cState governments do not control the police or the Army. So it is irresponsible for a minister to make such statement in the face of what is going on in the country.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026One abducted Greenfield varsity student freed after parents paid N20m ransom\n\n\u2026Parents of Afaka 29 students protest plight of their children at NASS\n\n\u2026Accuse FG, Kaduna govt of negligence\n\n\u2026Parents look hopeless, depend on National Assembly \u2014 Reps\n\n\u2026FG, KDSG working together to secure Kaduna varsity students\u2019 freedom \u2013 Lai Mohammed\n\n\u2026Allow more time for negotiation, don\u2019t kill them, NAPTAN pleads\n\n\u2026If you\u2019ve better solution than ransom, put it to work \u2014 Shehu Sani\n\nBy Soni Daniel, Northern Region Editor, Adesina Wahab, Levinus Nwabughiogu, Luminous Jannamike & Ibrahim Hassan\n\nOne of the abducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna State has been released by the abductors.\n\nThe kidnappers had threatened yesterday to eliminate the remaining 17 of the students in their custody should their parents fail to pay them N100 million ransom, in addition to 10 motorcycles.\n\nAlthough the police and government authorities are yet to confirm the development, mother of the student, Lauritta Attahiru confirmed the release of her son yesterday but failed to disclose whether ransom was paid before his release.\n\nA source close to the family, however, said N20 million was paid for the student to be released.\n\nThese developments came on a day parents of the remaining 29 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation and those of Greenfield Varsity students stormed the National Assembly complex to protest the plight of their children in kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nBut the House of Representatives said parents of the abducted students depended on the National Assembly to rescue their wards from captivity.\n\nThis is even as the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji lai Mohammed, said yesterday that both the federal and Kaduna State governments were working assiduously to ensure the release of the remaining students of Greenfield University, who had been in the captivity of their abductors since last month.\n\nAlso, Shehu Sani, former Kaduna senator, said yesterday that it is dangerous for the state government to do nothing about rescuing the abducted students of Greenfield University.\n\nAnguish, as abductors release 1 Greenfield student, hold on to 16\n\nHowever, some of the parents of the abducted varsity students also confirmed that the student was released on Saturday after his mother, wife of a retired Army officer from Plateau State negotiated and paid ransom to the bandits privately before they released her son.\n\nThe parents had earlier said the bandits had been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20 million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and ten motorcycles on Monday, May 3.\n\nThey appealed to the government and Nigerians to come to their aid, so their children could be rescued alive from the hands of their abductors.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students hangs in the balance, even as the bandits threatened to kill them if their parents and government fail to pay the N100 million ransom and also provide ten new motorcycles.\n\nAt press time yesterday, it couldn\u2019t be ascertained if the bandits will carry out their threat.\n\nParents of 29 abducted Afaka students, Greenfield varsity protest at NASS\n\nSimilarly, parents of the remaining 29 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation and the 17 undergraduates forcibly taken away from the Greenfield University, both in Kaduna State, yesterday stormed the National Assembly complex to protest the continued stay of their childen in the bandits\u2019 den.\n\nThey were joined in the protest by Publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, and rights\u2019 activist, Deji Adeyanju.\n\nMembers of the Students Union Governments, SUGs, of the schools also took part in the protest.\n\nDressed in black, the demonstrators gathered at the Unity Fountain at about 9:15 am before marching through Shehu Shagari way to the National Assembly complex over what they described as the negligence of the Kaduna State and the Federal Government in securing the release of their children.\n\nThe main entrance of the National Assembly was, however, manned by security agents who denied the protesters entrance.\n\nREAD ALSO: Boko Haram responsible for Greenfield students kidnap, not bandits \u2014 Sheikh Gumi\n\nChanting solidarity songs and displaying placards to express their disappointment with the manner government had handled the abduction of the students, the protesters also demanded for compensation from the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria for all the 10 Afaka students released so far by the bandits to take care of their needs and health challenges.\n\nTheir placards bore inscription such as: \u2018Safe education is our right\u2019; \u2018#BringBackOurStudents\u2019, \u2018Free Afaka 29, Free Greenfield 17!\u2019, among others.\n\n\u2018Govt hasn\u2019t done enough\u2019\n\nSpeaking to journalists during the protest, one of the parents, Mr. Odibe, said: \u201cWe are here today because we feel abandoned and worried that after 55 days of the abduction of our children, the government has not done enough to rescue them.\n\n\u201cAs of today, there is no inkling of hope from any government quarters, suggesting any time for the release of our children. My son is the only one I have. I don\u2019t have a husband, I\u2019m a widow.\u201d\n\nThe frustrated parents also sought the intervention of the federal lawmakers to query the Minister of Environment, whose ministry oversees the affairs of the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria, which in turn oversees the affairs of Afaka College where their children were abducted.\n\nIn his speech, Adeyanju lamented the silence of the government over the ultimatum given by the bandits holding 17 students of the Greenfield varsity as captives.\n\n\u201cThe government has not said anything about the ultimatum given by the abductors of the Greenfield University students. Those students may be killed today (yesterday), if nothing is done to rescue them. They have killed five of them already.\n\n\u201cToday (yesterday) is the deadline given by the kidnappers of the students. The government knows exactly where the kidnapped students are held. If they don\u2019t know, they should ask Sheikh Gumi. What is stopping them from rescuing them?\u201d the rights\u2019 activist queried. On his part, Sowore expressed disappointment with the overall handling of security by the government.\n\nFG, Kaduna govt working on it \u2014 Lai Mohammed\n\nBut the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, assured that both the federal and Kaduna State governments were working together to ensure the release of the remaining students of the Greenfield University, who had been in the captivity of their abductors since last month.\n\nThe minister gave the assurance, while addressing a press conference at the National Press Centre in Abuja.\n\n\u2018Parents depend on NASS for rescue\u2019\n\nOn its part, the House of Representatives said parents of the abducted students depend on the National Assembly to rescue their wards from captivity.\n\nThe House made the declaration on a day the parents and the institution\u2019s Students Union Government, SUG, stormed the assembly complex in protest against the continued disappearance of their children.\n\nSpeaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, had upon the news of their arrival to the gate, directed all the chairmen of security related committees, including Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force, to meet with the parents.\n\nOn return to the chamber one hour later, the chairman, House Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson, on behalf of his colleagues, told his colleagues that the parents pleaded with the House to intervene in the matter.\n\nBenson said the protesters had left the main gate of the National Assembly back to the unity fountain when they got there, leaving them to follow suit, adding that the parents looked oppressed, suppressed and dejected.\n\n\u201cThey feel they\u2019ve been abandoned and have not eaten since two days. They don\u2019t have any hope. The only hope they have is on the parliament. They sent us back to you to plead with you that their plight on their missing kids be addressed. They also requested that we speak on behalf of the kids that were kidnapped at Greenfield University,\u201d he said.\n\nRuling on the matter, Gbajabiamila, who expressed sadness over the development, referred the matter to the newly-set up ad hoc committee on security to proffer solutions.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t kill our children, NAPTAN pleads with abductors\u2019\n\nPleading on behalf of parents of the abducted students yesterday, the National Parents & Teachers Association of Nigeria, NAPTAN, appealed to the bandits to allow more time for negotiation that will lead to the peaceful resolution of the issue.\n\nNational President of NAPTAN, Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, who spoke in an interview with Vanguard, also pleaded with the bandits not to allow the face-off between them and Kaduna State Government push them into taking irrational action.\n\nDanjuma also called on the bandits to fear God and not kill the innocent students.\n\nHe spoke in reaction to the threat by the bandits that unless a ransom of N100 million was paid by today (yesterday) the remaining 17 students in their custody would be killed.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor me, I think the government should have a rethink about their decision not to dialogue or negotiate with the bandits. My position is based on the fact that entering into dialogue with them may not necessarily mean that government must have to pay them money. It could be an avenue to know their grouse and why they have such grouse with whosoever or whatsoever they have such.\n\n\u201cAssuming that the bandits even want to be paid some money, if government is not interested in paying any money, let the government allow the parents to raise the money and pay. I heard that the parents had raised and paid the bandits over N50 million, though I was not privy to that.\n\n\u201cThe government cannot just stay aloof and not do anything. Are the children of government officials among the innocent students being traumatised? The answer may be probably no. I plead with the bandits on behalf of all Nigerian parents to spare the lives of these children. They should not allow their faceoff with the government push them to do evil. None of the children of the governor is among the victims.\n\n\u201cThe bandits should also fear God and spare these children. The shedding of innocent blood should stop. We cannot continue this way. We are not only killing education in the country, we are hurting and putting the future of Nigeria in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous for KDSG to do nothing \u2014 Shehu Sani\n\nReacting yesterday, former Kaduna State senator, Shehu Sani, said it was dangerous for the state government to do nothing about rescuing the abducted students of Greenfield University.\n\nSince the kidnap of the students, Kaduna State Government had maintained that it would neither negotiate with nor pay ransom to bandits.\n\nBut reacting in a statement, Sani said the threats of the bandits must not be taken lightly, asking the state government why it had not rescued the students if it was not going to consider the alternative option of paying the ransom.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf the payment of ransom is not the solution, why are our security forces still unable to detect the whereabouts of the students and free them for this long. Doing nothing is dangerous.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a helpless people and a helpless government, then the nation is hopeless. Our tears will be needless for a tragedy we could have avoided.\n\n\u201cWe must not wait for bandits to throw the corpses of our 17 children on our doorsteps. We cannot claim to be fasting in a Holy month and helplessly watch the slaughter of our children.\n\n\u201cIf the government has a better solution to freeing the kidnapped students other than the one embarked upon by the parents of the students, let it be put to work immediately.\n\n\u201cKidnappers are holding the balls of the government and the groins of our country, getting out of it, by all means, is what matters.\n\n\u201cThe clock ticks for the lives of the students and for the honor of the government. If we fail to provide for the new generation, we must not fail to protect them.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Parents of the abducted students of Greenfield University Kaduna who were recently kidnapped from their hostel by gunmen suspected to be bandits are currently in confusion as the fate of their children remain unknown amid threat by the abductors to execute the victims after the Tuesday deadline.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that about 22 students were abducted from the university campus on April 20 when the assailants invaded the school premises and whisked the students away to an unknown destination.\n\nThe gunmen within a week, killed five of the victims as the State Governor, Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai vowed not to engage in negotiations with any bandit.\n\nThe governor in an interview recently, said even if his son is kidnapped by the bandits, he would rather ensure that he makes heaven than pay ransom for his release.\n\nFollowing the governor\u2019s refusal to engage in negotiations, the helpless parents have several times staged protests in Kaduna, demanding the intervention of the Federal and State Government to ensure the students are rescued alive.\n\nHowever, their efforts were relatively unproductive as the students remain in captivity.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the leader of the abductors who identified himself as Sani Idris Jalingo on Monday gave the Nigerian government Tuesday as the deadline to make the ransom available or prepare a truck to convey the bodies of the student.\n\nJalingo who spoke in an interview on Hausa Service of Voice of America (VOA), said the remaining 17 students would be killed if the government failed to meet their demand.\n\nAccording to him, the demand includes N100 million and 10 brand Honda motorcycles which he referred to as \u2018Boko Haram\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou are speaking with the abductors of Greenfield students. We heard the utterances of the Kaduna State Governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms.\n\n\u201cIf they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand-new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, it was reported that one of the 17 students was released on Tuesday, leaving sixteen in captivity.\n\nThe mother of the student, Lauritta Attahiru confirmed the release of her son to newsmen on Tuesday.\n\nIt was unclear whether the parents paid ransom before the son was freed by the abductors as the mother refused to give details of the release.\n\nHowever, some of the parents said the student was released on Saturday after his mother, who is the wife of a Retired Army officer from Plateau State negotiated and paid ransom to the bandits privately before they released her son on Saturday.\n\nRecall that before his VOA interview, Jalingo had during negotiations with parents asked for N20 million for each of their captive.\n\nFollowing the threat, the parents have, however, pleaded with the abductors to exercise patience while they work towards the provision of the N100 million and the 10 motorcycles.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the frustrated parents on Tuesday stormed the National Assembly where they expressed their disappointment on how the government is keeping mum on the issue.\n\nThey also demanded that the lawmakers intervene to expedite the release of their children before the deadline elapses.\n\nSome concerned Nigerians worried about the fate of the students, went spiritual by soliciting prayers from Nigerians to ensure the students are released alive.\n\nFormer Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode on his verified Twitter handle, said his heart goes with the abducted students.\n\n\u201cPlease pray for the Greenfield University students. Pray very hard for divine intervention. My heart goes out to the children and their parents in this dark hour. May God help us all\u201d, he tweeted.\n\nThe Founder and Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministry, Apostle Johnson Suleman blamed the government for pampering the bandits before the situation escalated.\n\nOn his verified Twitter handle, the renowned gospel preacher said, \u201cWhen they started pampering \u201crepentant bandits\u201d I cried out.

Let the Lord preserve them. Let the Angels of the Lord reactivate(Acts 12)and set them free in Jesus name.\n\nA Nigerian actor and comedian, Kunle Idowu, popularly known as Frank Donga slammed the security agencies for their inability to rescue the students.\n\n\u201cWhen I remember the students killed at #Greenfielduniversity and those still in danger, I can\u2019t help thinking that some people somewhere are collecting salaries and allowances for securing citizens and there\u2019s this much insecurity\u201d, he tweeted.\n\nDAILY POST had reported that the Senator who represented the Kaduna Centre, during the 8th National Assembly, Shehu Sani on Tuesday urged the government to immediately rescue the stranded students.\n\n\u201cThe abduction of Students of the Greenfield University that follows the kidnapping of the students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization is a condemnable and dangerous dimension to the apparent paralysis of security in Kaduna State and the North West.\n\n\u201cThe Federal and Kaduna State Governments must not take lightly the threats by the bandits to callously harm these helpless students on the expiration of their dateline.\n\n\u201cKidnappers are holding the Balls of the Government and the groins of our country, getting out of it, by all means, is what matters.\n\n\u201cThe clock ticks for the lives of the students and the honour of the Government.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to provide for the new generation, we must not fail to protect them,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday.",

          "text": "Parents of the abducted students of Greenfield University Kaduna who were recently kidnapped from their hostel by gunmen suspected to be bandits are currently in confusion as the fate of their children remain unknown amid threat by the abductors to execute the victims after the Tuesday deadline.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that about 22 students were abducted from the university campus on April 20 when the assailants invaded the school premises and whisked the students away to an unknown destination.\n\nThe gunmen within a week, killed five of the victims as the State Governor, Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai vowed not to engage in negotiations with any bandit.\n\nThe governor in an interview recently, said even if his son is kidnapped by the bandits, he would rather ensure that he makes heaven than pay ransom for his release.\n\nFollowing the governor\u2019s refusal to engage in negotiations, the helpless parents have several times staged protests in Kaduna, demanding the intervention of the Federal and State Government to ensure the students are rescued alive.\n\nHowever, their efforts were relatively unproductive as the students remain in captivity.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the leader of the abductors who identified himself as Sani Idris Jalingo on Monday gave the Nigerian government Tuesday as the deadline to make the ransom available or prepare a truck to convey the bodies of the student.\n\nJalingo who spoke in an interview on Hausa Service of Voice of America (VOA), said the remaining 17 students would be killed if the government failed to meet their demand.\n\nAccording to him, the demand includes N100 million and 10 brand Honda motorcycles which he referred to as \u2018Boko Haram\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou are speaking with the abductors of Greenfield students. We heard the utterances of the Kaduna State Governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms.\n\n\u201cIf they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand-new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, it was reported that one of the 17 students was released on Tuesday, leaving sixteen in captivity.\n\nThe mother of the student, Lauritta Attahiru confirmed the release of her son to newsmen on Tuesday.\n\nIt was unclear whether the parents paid ransom before the son was freed by the abductors as the mother refused to give details of the release.\n\nHowever, some of the parents said the student was released on Saturday after his mother, who is the wife of a Retired Army officer from Plateau State negotiated and paid ransom to the bandits privately before they released her son on Saturday.\n\nRecall that before his VOA interview, Jalingo had during negotiations with parents asked for N20 million for each of their captive.\n\nFollowing the threat, the parents have, however, pleaded with the abductors to exercise patience while they work towards the provision of the N100 million and the 10 motorcycles.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the frustrated parents on Tuesday stormed the National Assembly where they expressed their disappointment on how the government is keeping mum on the issue.\n\nThey also demanded that the lawmakers intervene to expedite the release of their children before the deadline elapses.\n\nSome concerned Nigerians worried about the fate of the students, went spiritual by soliciting prayers from Nigerians to ensure the students are released alive.\n\nFormer Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode on his verified Twitter handle, said his heart goes with the abducted students.\n\n\u201cPlease pray for the Greenfield University students. Pray very hard for divine intervention. My heart goes out to the children and their parents in this dark hour. May God help us all\u201d, he tweeted.\n\nThe Founder and Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministry, Apostle Johnson Suleman blamed the government for pampering the bandits before the situation escalated.\n\nOn his verified Twitter handle, the renowned gospel preacher said, \u201cWhen they started pampering \u201crepentant bandits\u201d I cried out. Repentance is unto God, not man. Then they started paying bandits.\n\n\u201cNow it has become a lucrative business for trigger happy fellows and enemies of our collective patrimony.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pray for #Greenfielduniversity students.

They saw huge flames, but couldn\u2019t enter as the gate and door were locked.\n\nTshwane emergency services managed to put out the fire but it was already too late. Firefighters discovered the bodies of a man and woman who were declared dead by paramedics.\n\nThe Tshwane emergency services said the cause of the fire has not been determined yet.\n\nMapula Rikhotso from Atteridgeville Police Station said an inquest docket was opened. He added that investigations were already underway as they are trying to determine if there was any foul play.\n\nUncle Lazarus Mphela (44) said Mphela was a good and kind man. He said he is finding it hard to believe that Mphela went to such lengths just because of alcohol.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is he was controlled by alcohol when drunk.

It\u2019s sad to see what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the couple\u2019s tragic death, community leader Samuel Masilela has since called on his community members and well-wishers to assist the couple\u2019s children with a shack, clothes, food, school uniforms, and all documents as everything burnt in the fire.\n\nDailySun ZA",

          "text": "By Oladeji Adeola\n\nTravelling by road could be an amazing experience, depending solely on where you are heading, your purpose of visiting and the mode of transport.\n\nTravelling by road is cheap and very exciting. It enables you to sight see, interact and take pictures along the way. It is a flexible mode of transport as it gives you the options of cancelling or setting out without much preparation.\n\nTo leave the shores of Nigeria legally by road, you are required to have a Nigerian passport, Valid Identification Card, Yellow card or certificate that shows you\u2019ve been vaccinated from Yellow fever and of course Money.\n\nHere are some African countries you can travel to as a Nigerian:\n\n1. GHANA: The journey from Nigeria to Ghana by road is quite a long one but it\u2019s the scenic route. So brace yourself for the adventure. You can either choose to go directly with a transport company or hire out a taxi to take you. You can also get a bus from Jibowu or Maza maza heading to Accra or Weija.\n\nGhana has great street foods, tourist markets and amazing people. To avoid extortion on the road, arm yourself with your passport, yellow card and Ghana Cedis before travelling. It is also advisable to have other means of identification like a driver\u2019s license or a student/work ID Card.\n\n2. MALI: Travelling by road to Mali, a sub-Sahara African country is more popular and cheaper through Northern Nigeria. The famous Katsina \u2013Maradi route is still in operation regardless of the hiccups on the way. Another alternative is to board a vehicle from Togo heading to Mali or go to Northern Ghana and board a bus.\n\n3. CAMEROON: To travel to Cameroon, first you need to head to Akwa Ibom in Southern Nigeria from where you\u2019ll travel to the city of Calabar. The second half of the journey is to the town of Ekom and to the Cameroonian border. Lastly, you can board a bus from Ekok to Douala.\n\n4. IVORY COAST: Ivory Coast, also known as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is a country located on the south coast of West Africa. Travelling to Ivory Coast by road allows you to see some nice places in Cotonou, Togo and Ghana and take good pictures of them.\n\nBasically, travelling to Ivory Coast by road is good for sightseeing. You can board a bus going to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire by road in Maza Maza, Lagos State.\n\n5. BENIN REPUBLIC: There are a lot of amazing places for sight-seeing and fun activities in this country, places like Hotel Benin Marina Beach, The Pendjari National Park and Cotonou craft market.\n\nIf you won\u2019t be traveling with a transport company, you can board a bus at Mile 2 Motor Park in Lagos going to the borders of Seme. From there, you can board a taxi to Cotonou.\n\n6. TOGO: Togo is a country in West Africa bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. The country extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, where its capital Lom\u00e9 is located.\n\nYou can travel to Togo with transport companies or board a bus at Mile 2 Motor Park in Lagos.\n\n7. SIERRA LEONE: Sierra Leone is on the southwest coast of West Africa. It is bordered by Liberia to the southeast and Guinea to the northeast. The capital of Sierra Leone and its largest city is Freetown.\n\nYou can travel directly from Lagos to Freetown with a transport company or by a private car. If you are looking for a cheaper way to get to Sierra Leone from Nigeria by road, Mile 2 Motor Park in Lagos is your other option. There you can select the vehicle that you wish to convene you.",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije Sola Ojo, Kaduna and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nOne of the abducted students of Greenfield University, has been released by the bandits.\n\nAlthough the police and the Kaduna government were yet to confirm the development, mother of the student, confirmed the release of her son, yesterday.\n\nShe, however, refused to give details of how he was released and whether a ransom was paid or not.\n\nIt was gathered that the student was released on Saturday after his mother, who is the wife of a retired army officer, privately negotiated and paid a ransom.\n\nThe parents had earlier revealed that the bandits have been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay N20 million before they eventually demanded a bulk sum of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday, as condition for their release.\n\nThe parents, however, appealed to government and Nigerians to come to their aid so that their children will be rescued alive.\n\nOn April 20, no fewer than 23 students and staff were abducted by bandits in Kasarami village, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students still hangs in the balance even as the bandits have threatened to kill them if their parents and government failed to pay the N100 million ransom and also provide 10 new motorcycles.\n\nAlthough nothing has been heard from the bandits as it relates with their demand and ultimatum which expired yesterday, the national leadership of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) has appealed to the abductors not to carry out their threat.\n\nNational President of the association, Haruna Danjuma, said it was necessary to beg the bandits because the threat has caused tensions and fears among families, relatives and other concerned citizens in the state the moment the threat went viral.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked and not happy with that statement on the radio that all our remaining Greenfield students would be killed if we failed to give N100 million and 10 motorcycles to them today (yesterday).\n\n\u201cWe are simply begging them not to kill any other student because they are innocents,\u201d he said.\n\nReps wade in\n\nParents of students of the College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka in Kaduna State, who were abducted by bandits, on March 11, yesterday, staged a protest at the National Assembly.\n\nThe parents, who were joined by the Students Union Government (SUG) and civil society organisations, appealed to the lawmakers to ensure the safe release of the students.\n\nThe protesters, who were not allowed entry into the main gate of the National Assembly complex, blocked the entrance of the federal secretariat adjacent to the parliament.\n\nThe House of Representatives has pledged to liaise with relevant authorities to secure release of the adducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna State.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila made the pledge at plenary after a delegation of the House interfaced with the protesting parents.\n\nGbajabiamila referred the matter to the House Special Committee on Security and said the House would immediately liaise with relevant authorities to secure their release.\n\nBriefing the House earlier, leader of the delegation, Benson Babajimi, said the parents, who were dressed in black, looked oppressed and dejected.\n\nBabajimi, who is the chairman, House Committee on Defence, said the parents\u2019 hope of getting their children released, rest on the parliament.",

The main opposition party said it was dropping the toga of politics in the national interest.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the PDP did not respect its own words, as it played cheap politics while playing the Ostrich.

          "text": "\u2022Threatens to \u2018ruffle unruly feathers\u2019\n\n\u2022Accusation baseless, PDP, Afenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN fire back\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe presidency yesterday accused some religious and political leaders of plotting to forcibly remove President Muhammadu Buhari from office, warning that it would thwart the moves and ruffle some unruly feathers in the process.\n\nThe presidency, however, came under fire as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere; the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in separate reactions dismissed the allegation.\n\nThe main opposition party described the allegation as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nAfenifere said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said in a statement that available evidence indicated that some disgruntled religious and past political leaders are poised to throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel an undemocratic change of leadership.\n\nAdesina\u2019s statement came a day after the Department of State Services (DSS) alleged that some \u201cmisguided elements\u201d were threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nDSS spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Monday, had said that among those threatening the federal government and Nigeria\u2019s unity are \u201csome religious and past political leaders who have either called for a forceful change of government or mass action against it.\u201d\n\nThe presidency in a reaction to the DSS yesterday said there is proof that the disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of a conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed on the president, thus throwing the land into turmoil.\n\nIt stated: \u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country. The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nIt added that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999 and the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\u201d\n\nThe presidency also accused external forces of collaborating with some individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such moves.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country. But the presidency, already vested with mandate and authority by Nigerians till 2023, pledges to keep the country together, even if some unruly feathers would be ruffled in the process,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some analysts told THISDAY last night that the presidency might have been reacting to a grand move by some past leaders of the country to hold a conference to discuss the state of the nation, which they said had been hemmed by massive violence from non-state actors, including bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and separatist elements.\n\nThe conference being facilitated by a former head of state is expected to be attended by leaders of prominent regional political groups, civil society organisations, religious leaders and past political office holders.\n\nThe groundwork had reached an advanced stage and state intelligence agencies and the presidency, the analysts, said may have panicked in the fear that the conference in dissecting the litany of woes that have befallen the country may throw up conversations and conclusions that are certain to embarrass the Buhari administration.\n\nThis is Blackmail, PDP Fires Back\n\nReacting to the allegation, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed it, describing it as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe PDP said rather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing the nation, the presidency was engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that the Buhari presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically-elected government.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cThe presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically-elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood.\n\n\u201cEven in 2019, Nigerians will be quick to remember how the APC imported bandits, vandals and thugs from neighbouring countries, as political mercenaries, to unleash violence, disrupt our voting processes and muscle itself into power.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the presidency and the APC to look inwards for those allegedly plotting to upturn democracy.\n\n\u201cOur party believes that the statement by the Buhari presidency is an attempt by the APC to heighten political tension in our country ahead of the 2023 election, having realised that they cannot face the people at the polls,\u201d it added.\n\nThe PDP, however, advised the APC to know that such blackmail against Nigerians cannot work.\n\n\u201cFor us in the PDP, our party will remain undeterred, alongside other patriotic Nigerians, in our commitment towards the sustenance and stability of our democracy as well as the unity and corporate existence of our country, Nigeria,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN Dismiss allegation\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF and the CAN also dismissed the allegation by the presidency that some religious and political leaders are part of a plot to overthrow Buhari.\n\nThe leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the whole world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that given Buhari\u2019s poor performance, there is no need for any group to \u201cgather anywhere to pass a vote of no confidence in him.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo, who described the 1999 Constitution as a fraud, also urged the president to, as a matter of urgency, return the 1964 Constitution agreed on by the founding fathers of Nigeria, including the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho is interested in passing vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him? That is not the issue. The main thing is to restructure the country back to federalism and forget all these gossips by Adesina. We don\u2019t have to pass a vote of no confidence for the world to know we don\u2019t have any confidence in Buhari.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any group who wants to take over the government, but I know those of us who want the country to be restructured in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cThose of us in Afenifere and all other groups in the South who are agitating for restructuring are the friends of Nigeria, are the friends of Buhari. I hope it is not too late for Buhari to realise this.\u201d\n\nACF also said it was wrong for the presidency to see all its critics as disgruntled people with ulterior motives.\n\nThe spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, told THISDAY that the presidency should be broad-minded and tolerate all shades of opinions.\n\nAccording to him, many criticisms against the government are done in good faith to help improve the situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany criticisms are done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the president and his team were becoming confused.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president and his team have gone blind and confused since in their world view, Rev. Father Mbaka and others who are telling them the truth about what is happening in the country have now become enemies.\n\n\u201cYou should know they have run out of excuses and have turned to blackmail even those who love them and want them to do what is good for the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEvery religious leader who chooses to stand with the people and is demanding good governance is now disgruntled.\u201d\n\nThe CAN chairman said the presidency needed \u201cto pause a little and remember that these people whom they are calling names today stood with them and for them when those who think they know them more warned against it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians have since passed their vote on Buhari and his government after watching helplessly how bandits have taken over the country; our young university students are being killed and destroyed.\u201d\n\nHayab appealed to those who are making statements on behalf of the presidency to be careful with their poor words and strive to win the support and confidence of the people with love and facts, not blackmail.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the CAN President on Media and Communications, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said beyond praying for things to get better, religious leaders reserved the right to criticise the authorities if they were not doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf the government accused some religious and past political leaders of planning to remove President Muhammadu Buhari, in what ways has that concerned the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)? The biblical responsibilities of the church include but not limited to praying for those who are in the position of authority but to criticise when doing wrongs or performing below the average. Check the Bible; there was never a time a bad ruler was spared from criticism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the government should pre-occupy itself with how best to tackle insecurity and ensure the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cOur candid advice to the government is to find an answer to the menace of insecurity occasioned by the bandits, kidnappers and terrorists. The country is approaching the precipice and President Muhammadu Buhari is in the position of rescuing the country by stopping the unprecedented bloodshed.\n\n\u201cIt is only the fool that goes to bed when his roof is on fire. Our members and non-members are being kidnapped and killed while the government appears helpless,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, fixing the security challenges is beyond issuing press releases or threatening to deal with the criminals.\n\nHe stated that 24 hours after Buhari vowed never to tolerate any banditry attack on schools, the bandits struck, adding that the victims are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cWhat is the government doing to rescue the victims? Some university students who were kidnapped in Kaduna are being killed but the government is too busy threatening the critics. We advise the presidency to recall all the promises made by Buhari during the electioneering and what is happening under his watch. Until his government wakes up to its responsibilities, the church will not keep quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a reaction, PANDEF National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, expressed shock that the presidency would under the prevailing situation of disastrous insecurity tag religious leaders and past political leaders \u201cdisgruntled.\u201d\n\nHe said such a statement was the least expected from government.\n\nThe group urged the presidency to stop chasing shadows, stressing that Nigerians are anxious, troubled and many are becoming hopeless over the worsening insecurity, while the security agencies appear helpless and vulnerable.\n\nPANDEF asked Buhari to involve all critical stakeholders nationwide in efforts at finding solutions to the problems facing the nation.\n\nIt said: \u201cWhat we expect from President Muhammadu Buhari, at this time, is to rally all critical stakeholders, from all sectors and sections of the country, to build national consensus and fashion out collective and holistic ways to address the hybrid problems confronting the country.

          "text": "\u2022Abductors free one more captive\n\n\u2022Security council meeting continues today\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed its commitment to do all it could to save the remaining 16 students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, whose abductors have threatened to kill for the delay in ransoming them.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja where he faulted the recommendations by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in resolving the growing insecurity in the country, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the federal government, in line with its constitutional responsibility of protecting all Nigerians, would not fold its arms and allow the bandits who kidnapped the students execute them.\n\nThe bandits had on Monday threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom was not met by yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by yesterday, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nOf the about 22 students abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm, the bandits have killed five.\n\nHowever, the bandits might have reconsidered their decision to kill the remaining students yesterday as one of them was freed under a yet-to-be-clear circumstances. Their parents also appealed to the bandits to spare the lives of the students.\n\nAt the press conference in Abuja, Mohammad also spoke on efforts by the federal government to combat the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHowever, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the three service chiefs will tomorrow brief the Senate on their efforts so far to address the security problems.\n\nMohammed also faulted the recommendations by the PDP in resolving the security crisis, saying the contents of its recent press conference had exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of Monday\u2019s press briefing by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in which he canvassed, among others, state police, devolution of powers and the establishment of border protection council, as part of steps to combat insecurity.\n\nMohammed accused PDP of merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\nThe minister also threatened to expose the forces behind the current security challenges at the \u2018\u2019appropriate time\u2019\u2019 and deal with them.\n\nHe stated that the alarm raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) on the plot by some powerful forces to destabilise the government only confirmed the consistent position of the federal government that there were plots by some political forces to make the country ungovernable.\n\nHe said the federal government was shocked that \u2018\u2019a party that ruled the country for all of 16 years does not know that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offences.\u201d\n\nIt advised the PDP to call out the states, including those being controlled by it, to ensure a rigorous prosecution of arrested kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u2018\u2019PDP conveniently forgot that as far as terrorism, a federal offence, is concerned, this federal government has successfully prosecuted thousands of Boko Haram members in Kainji, as part of a continuing exercise. We are now seeking the cooperation of the judiciary to continue with the trial of arrested terrorists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister explained that while PDP claimed to have ostensibly offered suggestions to the federal government on some topical issues, especially national security by dropping the toga of politics in the national interest, the party played cheap politics.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019The party went ahead to make wild accusations against the president and his government. For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a government of exclusion.\n\n\u2018\u2019The opposition party then went ahead to reel out a number of suggestions as a way out of the current challenges facing the nation. Unfortunately, the recommendations by the PDP have exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry, and the fact that it was merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\n\u2018\u2019Had it not been so, and had it done its homework properly, the PDP would have known that most of those same recommendations were already contained in the outcome of the federal government\u2019s town hall meeting on national security, which was held in Kaduna on April 8, 2021,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\n\nAbductors Free One More Kaduna Student\n\nMeanwhile, one of the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, has been released.\n\nThe mother of the released student, Mrs. Lauretta Attahiru, confirmed this yesterday to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nShe, however, declined to make further comments on how her son was released.\n\nThe police could not also be reached to confirm the release of the student as Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police command, did not respond to telephone calls and a text message.\n\nThe parents had earlier said the bandits had been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20 million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students remained uncertain yesterday, especially given the bandits\u2019 threat to kill them over the inability to ransom them.\n\nAlso yesterday, the President of the National Association of Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTA), Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, pleaded with the bandits to spare the lives of their victims.\n\nDanjuma told journalists in Kaduna that the parents of the affected students and Nigerians had been gripped by fear and tension following the threat by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cWe are simply begging them not to kill any other student in view of the fact that they are innocent.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is really worrisome and we as parents, are concerned and worried over the lives of our students and teachers of the university,\u201d he said.\n\nA former senator who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, also appealed to Fulani socio-cultural groups to intercede to secure the release of the students.\n\nSani tweeted that he had privately appealed to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore to help secure the release of the students.\n\nSecurity Council Meeting Continues Today\n\nMeanwhile, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja, to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting, which will be the third in less than a week, will as usual be presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIndications that the meeting will continue today was emerged when yesterday\u2019s meeting ended without any media briefing or press statement issued.\n\nAlso, the President of the Senate, Dr .Ahmad Lawan, at Senate plenary on why the CDS and the service chiefs could not appear before the senators yesterday, said at the commencement of plenary that the military top brass could not honour invitation due to the National Security Council meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, the National Security Council is continuing its meeting that it started last week. Therefore the invited security heads will not be able to come for the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure if they will finish their meeting today (Tuesday). We assume it could spill to Wednesday too,\u201d he added.\n\nLawan, however, said the CDS and the service chiefs would brief the Senate tomorrow on the security situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have now fixed the date for the briefing to be Thursday, May 6,\u201d adding that the briefing will enrich the knowledge of his colleagues about security issues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Mergers of MDAs, budget review on the card\n\n\u2022Akabueze proposes six-region structure\n\nNdubuisi Francis, Olawale Ajimotokan and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has initiated a raft of measures to cut the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue occasioned by the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant global economic tailspin.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said yesterday in Abuja that the measures were targeted at reducing recurrent expenditure, which is projected to gulp about 41.5 per cent of the total provisions of N13.588 trillion in the 2021 budget, amounting to N5.64 trillion.\n\nShe stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the salaries and wages committee to review the payroll of public servants as well as consider the merger of some agencies.\n\nBesides, the government will also remove some unnecessary items from the budget as a move to cut the cost of governance.\n\nAhmed spoke at a policy dialogue on \u2018corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practice and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nAlso at the occasion, the Director-General, Budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, proposed a constitutional amendment to pave the way for the restructuring of the country into six regions instead of the present 36 states structure. This, he said, would help to reduce the rising cost of governance.\n\nAhmed stated that the proposed cost-saving measures was aimed at streamlining government expenditure with revenue.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue.\u201d\n\nShe urged all government agencies to come together to trim the cost amid the country\u2019s dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the nation\u2019s budgets are filled every year with projects that are recycled and that are also not necessary.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair, work together with the head of service and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister said the federal government would also review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates, adding that the government will consider merging two agencies with the same mandate.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe need to work together; all agencies of the government to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures\u2013expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year-in-year out with projects that we see over and over again and also projects that are not necessary.\u201d\n\nAkabueze, in a paper titled: \u2018Reducing the Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 described the country\u2019s current system of democratic governance as very expansive and expensive.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that mandated the president to appoint a minister from at least each of the 36 states, should be amended to reduce the number of federal cabinet members.\n\nHe cited the large federal structure to be one of the drivers of the high cost of governance and engendering public outcry that government spending is largely on recurrent activities at the expense of capital projects.\n\nWhile describing the subsisting fiscal policy as unsustainable, Akabueze said the persistent call for the reduction of governance cost had continued to gain momentum in view of its impact on government fiscal situation.\n\nHe stated that the cost of governance is considerably cheaper in the United States from where Nigeria copied the presidential system of government.\n\nAccording to him, the general cost of administration in the United States is less than 10 per cent of the total annual budgets while the United States, with a higher population than Nigeria, has only 15 secretaries and executive departments as against Nigeria, which has 27 ministers, 16 ministers of state and 27 ministries.\n\nHe lamented that the federal government is maintaining 943 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) with many of them having duplicated functions.\n\n\u201cThere are 541 federal government-owned public corporations and enterprises. We need to cut these in order to install efficiency in governance. Also, we have a bloated civil service. The current civil service structure and size is clearly unsustainable for Nigeria\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warned against the tendency where the civil service is accorded political, ethnic and religious patronage.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive staff auditing and job available is imperative to determine the right size of the federal civil service without having any adverse effect on the service. And to avoid duplication in the civil service, the staff rationalisation programme should be gradual,\u201d he added.\n\nAkabueze said the federal government\u2019s recurrent spending accounted for more than 75 per cent of the actual MDAs expenditure between 2011 and 2020, in addition to personnel cost which accounted for government significant spending.\n\nHe accused the MDAs of incurring excessive personnel costs and wilfully indulging in wide range of underhand practices that are driving governance cost out of the ordinary.\n\nAccording to him, in 2016, personnel cost was N1.87 trillion while at the moment the same cost has spiralled to over N3 trillion.\n\nThe effect of the rising cost of running government, Akabueze added, is the reason why only 30 per cent of the budget is available for capital project and the cause behind many abandoned capital projects nationwide.\n\nHe said: \u201cPersonnel cost accounted for 31 per cent and 63 per cent of the total spending and retained revenue in 2020. In the USA, the general administration cost is less than 10 per cent of total budget.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe challenged Nigerians to task themselves on governance, saying that the success story of the Asian Tiger was a product of sound leadership and determination.\n\nICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, described the cost of governance as the driver of corruption in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government was committed to improving the country\u2019s revenue by focusing on new and existing sources and by streamlining payroll.\n\nHe added that the federal government would also ensure removal of subsidies and reduction in the cost of contracts and procurement are for the benefits of the vulnerable.\n\nHe listed critical area of concern to include payroll padding and the phenomenon of ghost workers.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s intended cost-cutting approach is coming amid a report by a public finance transparency advocacy firm, BudgIT that the 2021 federal budget contains over 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion.\n\nBudgIT, a public finance transparency advocacy firm, said in a report that the duplication of projects was just one among other loopholes for corruption in the budget.\n\nIt added that there were no audit records of N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\n\nIt said: \u201cOur investigations into the 2021 budget revealed at least 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion, with 115 of those duplicate projects occurring in the Ministry of Health. This is very disturbing, especially considering the health infrastructure deficit and the raging COVID-19 pandemic affecting Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBudgIT also found zero audit records of the N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\u201d\n\nIt also alleged that budgetary provisions were made for agencies for projects that are beyond their execution. It added: \u201cEven worse, agencies now receive allocations for capital projects they cannot execute. For example, the National Agriculture Seed Council has an allocation for N400m to construct solar street lights across all six geopolitical zones, while the Federal College of Forestry in Ibadan in Oyo State got N50m for the construction of street lights in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThese are aberrations that need to be corrected.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Presidency emphasised that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999, adding that the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences\u201d.\n\nIt also accused external forces of collaborating with the mischievous individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such move.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country.

          "text": "By Emma Okonji\n\nThe federal government has approved the extension of the deadline for National Identity Number (NIN)-SIM data verification from May 6 to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe decision to extend the date was reached at a virtual meeting chaired by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, which was attended by the Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Adeolu Akande; the Executive Vice-Chairman/CEO of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Dambatta; and the Director-General/CEO of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Azeez.\n\nThe recent extension, which is the sixth since December 2020, when the directive for NIN-SIM integration exercise was first issued, was based on the request by stakeholders for an extension till June 30 in order to make it easier for all citizens and legal residents to register their NIN and link same with their registered SIM cards.\n\nThe Director, Public Affairs at NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, and the Head, Corporate Communications at NIMC, Mr. Kayode Adegoke, who announced the recent extension in a joint statement signed by both of them, also announced that NIN enrolment has tranches 54 million.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cSignificant progress has been made in the NIN-SIM verification process. For example, almost 54 million people have obtained their NIN and this can translate to up to 190 million mobile numbers, since empirical evidence suggests that each unique NIN maps to 3 to 4 phone lines. The much awaited Android enrolment system is now ready for deployment and this has the potential to significantly accelerate the speed and ease of enrolments.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the telecom providers and other enrolment agents have also opened several centres across the country to make it easier for eligible citizens and residents to obtain and link their NINs.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that Sections 27 and 29 of the National Identity Management Commission Act, 2007 provides for the mandatory use of NIN for accessing several government services.\n\nThis is similar to the use of Social Security Number and National Insurance Number for accessing services in the United States of America and the United Kingdom respectively.\n\nThe federal government has approved the extension as part of its effort to make it easier for its citizens and residents to obtain the NIN and it is important to take advantage of the extension, the statement further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria's armed forces have dismissed suggestions that they should take over from President Muhammadu Buhari, who is facing mounting pressure over the country's worsening insecurity.\n\nIt was not the first time Nigeria's armed forces have issued a statement backing Buhari, but the latest has come after weeks of criticism of the 78-year-old former general's failures to stem the protracted security crisis.\n\nFrom a jihadist insurgency in the northeast to herder-farmer clashes in the centre, banditry in the northwest, and separatist tensions in the southeast, Buhari's armed forces appear to be struggling to curb insecurity.\n\nIn a statement late Monday, the armed forces said they would continue to \"fully\" support the government, remain politically neutral and protect Nigeria's democracy.\n\n\"Let it be stated categorically that the Armed Forces of Nigeria remain fully committed to the present administration and all associated democratic institutions,\" army spokesman Onyema Nwachukwu said in the statement.\n\n\"We shall continue to remain apolitical, subordinate to the civil authority, firmly loyal to the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari and the 1999 Constitution as amended,\" it said.\n\nLast week, lawmakers had urged Buhari to declare a nationwide state of emergency after a month of almost daily attacks, kidnappings and killings across Africa's most populous country, AFP reports.\n\nThe military statement referred explicitly to comments made by Robert Clarke, a prominent lawyer and social commentator. See Also Politics Nigeria On The Verge Of Collapse, Might Not Survive Another Six Months \u2014 Robert Clarke\n\nHe had said the country was on the brink of collapse and suggested the political leadership hand power to the military so that the security forces could be restructured.\n\nOpposition figures like Bukola Saraki and Nobel winner and playwright Wole Soyinka have also urged Buhari to seek external help or resign.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Buhari's office said \"some disgruntled religious and past political leaders\" were planning to \"eventually throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel a forceful and undemocratic change of leadership.\"\n\nDescribing such an attempt as \"patently illegal, and even treasonable,\" the presidency warned that such behaviour \"would attract the necessary consequences.\"\n\nBuhari met with his top security chiefs last week and again on Tuesday to discuss the country's violence.\n\n\"We shall continue to discharge our constitutional responsibilities professionally, especially in protecting the country's democracy, defence of the territorial integrity of the country as well as protection of lives and properties of citizens,\" the military statement said.\n\nThe army expressed the hope that the nation's \"current security challenges are not insurmountable.\"\n\nNigeria returned to democracy in 1999 after almost 16 years of military rule.\n\nBuhari, a former army commander and military ruler in the 1980s, was first elected in 2015 and re-elected four years later on a pledge to end the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast.\n\nRather than abate, the Islamist rebellion has stubbornly persisted with a Boko Haram splinter faction, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), becoming the dominant jihadist force.\n\nSince 2009 when it began, the jihadist uprising has killed 36,000 people and forced over two million others to flee their homes in Nigeria's northeast alone.\n\nThe violence has also spread to neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to fight the insurgents.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fifth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

          "title": "Microtraction\u2019s novel approach to early-stage investments in Africa is paying off",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on conversations with investors in Africa \u2013 investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, private equities, venture capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nYele Bademosi didn\u2019t start out in the tech space. Being born to parents in the medical field, he attempted to toe that same line. When he gained admission to study medicine at King\u2019s College London, it seemed like his path had been charted, until a few years later when he dropped out. Medicine just wasn\u2019t his passion.\n\nAfter leaving medical school, he launched his first startup in the UK \u2013 Purple, a social app that let university students with shared interests in the UK find and connect with each other. After efforts to scale the social media app proved abortive, he shut down the project and flew back to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, he got a job as a general manager of Starta \u2013 an online community and resource platform for African startup entrepreneurs. He helped Starta reach over 24,000 subscribers in eight months before it was acquired in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, after developing a taste for helping startups get off the ground, he founded Microtraction, an early-stage venture capital fund that has gone on to invest in over 15 startups.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed Director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of crypto platform, Binance. He was charged with developing Africa\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. He held this role until April 2020.\n\nIn August 2019, he founded Bundle, a social payments app for cash and cryptocurrency.\n\nOur conversation began with trying to understand what spurred Badamosi to hop on the venture capital train earlier than most people.\n\nYele Bademosi: I think the ecosystem is a lot different today than it was five years ago when I initially began thinking about the idea for Microtraction (MT).\n\nFor context, I spent about nine months working with Dotun, who is also a VC at Novastar. One of the things that we were doing was trying to help entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses through knowledge and networks. I realized from that experience that it was difficult for founders to raise money.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t really have any other avenue if they didn\u2019t have a network or a rich relative. That was what really drove this idea. How do we create an easier way for founders to raise money?\n\nAnother thing was the incubation model, which was also popular in Nigeria at the time, wasn\u2019t really a good fit for the market. We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\n\nI wanted to find an alternative means to invest and support entrepreneurs. This birthed the MT model. This idea of an open application for funding with fixed check sizes without a program or a demo day was something that was unique at the time and MT was the first vehicle to do something like that.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What did Micro traction think was missing?\n\nYB: For us, it was more about streamlining. People went into a physical space with a batch of other companies and at the end, there was a demo day. That was the norm \u2013 the YC model. Interestingly, we raised capital from a bunch of limited partners, including Michael Siebel (YC\u2019s CEO).\n\nWe didn\u2019t do programs because we felt that the materials that were being taught weren\u2019t entirely applicable to Nigeria and Africa at large. We also felt that that drove up the costs of running this program. You would spend anything from 60-80% on programs and only deploy maybe 20%. So from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\n\nThe second critical part was the batch model. You can\u2019t predict the timeline of the creation of quality companies. We felt that when you invest in batches, you end up investing in companies that may not be ready to take on external capital yet, or might not be venture backable. What we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\n\nThe third thing was this idea of demo days. I\u2019ve been to a number of demo days. Some of them were very well prepared, presented, and executed, but when you looked at the amount of funding that was picked up by these companies, it was quite low.\n\nWe prefer investor intros, building networks of investors, connecting our founders to investors who will invest in them.\n\nSo those three things: No batches, no programs, no demo days. That\u2019s what made the MT model unique.\n\nThe Microtraction Team\n\nDA: Interesting, I always thought MT was like YC. So what does your support look like?\n\nYB: It varies, there are a bunch of partners now at MT. My strength really is in product and business strategy. Chidinma, one of our partners, is very strong at financial operations for business and governance. Dayo is an ex-founder, he is able to provide first-hand experience of getting a business off the ground and what not to do or do. Ife is probably one of the best recruiters in the world. Antonia is our communications chief. Each person brings a unique set of skills that can help our companies.\n\nI think one thing we always tell founders, and I believe now more than ever especially since I\u2019ve started a startup is that a founder is what makes a company successful. We actually believe that our job is not to make \u2018okay\u2019 founders good, but to find great founders and cut the red tape or barriers that hinder them from building great companies.\n\nWe have a ton of various individuals and companies that are able to help our companies across hiring, fundraising, talent, business strategy, growth, regulatory and PR. A rolodex that you can go to get support and grow your company is very key. Now as the number of portfolio companies continues to scale, we also have a network of founders who are working in complementary spaces and they can learn from each other and connect with each other and open up their networks to each other.\n\nDA: What does a day look like at MT?\n\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies. Obviously, we spend more time with companies we\u2019ve just invested in versus a company that has been in our portfolio for three years.\n\nWe are also very honest with ourselves. We are a pre-seed fund. Our biggest impact is when you\u2019re getting off the ground; just having a listening ear and being able to help you think through the decisions that you want to make as a business.\n\nAnd as founders/ex-founders there\u2019s a very high level of empathy. We spend maybe 20% of our time networking with other investors and other players in the space or non-investors just building your network because your network is your capital as an investor. That\u2019s how we help our companies recruit or raise the next round of capital. 20% or 25% is spent talking to companies in our pipeline. The last 55% is spent on our portfolio companies.\n\nMT Partners, Dayo koleowo and Chidinma Iwueke\n\nDA: MT has a bias to invest in startups with technical founders/co-founders, why?\n\nYB: I think that really comes from my own experience as a founder. When I started my first company right out of leaving medical school, I tried without a technical founder and it was incredibly difficult.\n\nI raised money and spent money on outsourcing. Actually, I think I was fortunate with the developer I got because he actually built the product, but it took a long time because it wasn\u2019t the only thing he was working on. And it cost a lot of money. When I needed to make changes, I didn\u2019t have the capital to make the changes and I was extremely slow. It took about six, seven months to get to market.\n\nWhile this was going on, I had a friend in the UK who we used to build stuff together. He was technical, I was a product designer. We would have an idea on Thursday, meetup on Friday or Saturday, by Sunday evening we built something and it was on Play Store and App Store. It really confirmed to me the importance of having people on the team who have some kind of technical skill, because at the end of the day what gives a startup a high valuation is growth and what gives you the leverage for growth is the fact that your business is either software-based or tech-enabled in some way.\n\nIf we give you money and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders. We\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\n\nDA: MT offers only $25,000 for 7% equity to every company, why?\n\nYB: Essentially, it is more around standardisation. If we had to negotiate every single deal that we were going into, then it would be quite challenging. We\u2019re having numerous conversations because every investment we make, we\u2019re talking to another five or six companies. That\u2019s even at the investment committee level, at the second or third phone call or team call it\u2019s another 20 companies for every single investment. We think it\u2019s fair for these companies with little or no revenue but we also review our deal structure from time to time.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your due diligence process like and what\u2019s the time frame?\n\nYB: We have a due diligence checklist, essentially a lot of which is more around governance. Governance because we invest early in these companies, we make sure that the company has the right documents and structure to make them investible. We literally spend a lot of time actually getting documents like incorporation, founder vesting agreements, also reference calls \u2013 just things that show the company has good governance.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the areas that I think we can actually improve upon, which is saying, how much should you and can you fund an early-stage company that has not been in existence for a very long time. There are some that are less than a week because the company is prepared or usually it takes weeks, it depends on how prepared the company is.\n\nDayo Koleowo at TechCabal\u2019s Edtech Townhall\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nYB: When I think of what will make me not invest in this company, the first thing is market opportunity. How big can this business be? Venture capital is extremely skewed. It\u2019s really about maximum upside as opposed to protecting your downside. What I mean by that is when we invest in companies we try to project the best possible outcome for the company.\n\nSo if the maximum upside is still looking like a small company, then we won\u2019t invest. That\u2019s probably why we say no to the vast majority of companies.\n\nNumber two is the progress made over time. I ask myself, am I impressed with how fast the company has moved within a particular time period? For a lot of companies, their progress over time isn\u2019t impressive especially when there are other companies to benchmark in that space.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the team. How good is the team? I don\u2019t do this as much anymore, but when I first started, I used to ask myself a question \u2018would I work for this founder?\u2019\n\nIf I had just moved back, starting off my career in the Nigerian or African tech ecosystem, and I saw this company, would I want to join them? Obviously, after five years, it\u2019s not the same so I can\u2019t really use that same benchmark because things are a lot different. But I still ask would I love to work for this founder? A lot of times when the answer is yes, the team is usually very strong.\n\nThe intersection of team, market and progress over time is what we look at. When a company fails those things, I\u2019m typically not interested in investing.\n\nDA: How has Covid-19 affected MT?\n\nYB: We actually continued investing during the pandemic. COVID had a bigger effect on startups than investors because investors have already collected money upfront. As an investor, you\u2019re not directly affected, it will affect your portfolio companies. I think COVID-19 impacted the quantity and quality of deal flow \u2013 the rate at which we receive investment offers.\n\nDA: Any exits from your end?\n\nYB: At MT, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to exit some of our positions, but we\u2019ve not taken those offers primarily because we still believe that there are significant opportunities for these companies to grow. The beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments. Most people when they hear exits they think about exits like the Paystack exit but the less popular/more common exit is usually a secondary exit where an investor exits or sells some of its shares to an existing investor or incoming investor. What we\u2019ll learn with this ecosystem is that exits are just a matter of time and we\u2019ll definitely see more exits in the future.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the tech space?\n\nYB: We\u2019re going to see a lot of investments going into fintech. I think we are going to see larger rounds coming into the industry. They\u2019ll stimulate a lot more stuff up in crypto, but they will move beyond the exchanges. I think crypto will probably be the second or at least in the top five sectors. Recently, I was looking at deals I did at Binance labs. I think from a fundraising perspective those deals probably outperformed any group of recent investments given the time that they took to raise over a million within a year to 18 months.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see some innovations in real money gaming, not just sports betting, but through playing games where you can win/ lose some money or some prizes.\n\nI think there\u2019ll be some moves in what I call export services, or export software services, which are essentially entrepreneurs that build products offered to global markets. I would definitely love to invest in anyone that is building anything around those ideas \u2013 crypto, gaming and export services.",

This announcement follows a discussion that took place in January between Nigeria\u2019s vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo and Microsoft\u2019s Corporation President, Brad Smith.\n\nThe collaboration is in line with Nigeria\u2019s economic sustainable plan to grow the economy. It will foster job opportunities and upskill up to five million people in Nigeria, creating over 27,000 new digital jobs in the next three years.\n\nIn a statement by Microsoft, they are setting a \u201cbig goal to bring access to digital skills to five million people in Nigeria over the next three years. But this is not something we can do by ourselves. We will equip master trainers and, along with them, are committed to creating thousands of new jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we have an enormous opportunity to put technology to work, create jobs, to foster the technology ecosystem across Nigeria, and to use technology to preserve the best of the past and take us into the future.\u201d\n\nAs seen on Microsoft\u2019s website, each of Nigeria\u2019s six geo-political zones will have access to high-speed internet infrastructure courtesy of the digital transformation plan.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Airband team will work closely with local partners to improve broadband connectivity in these communities while also assisting with the design and implementation of hyper-scale cloud services.\u201d\n\nOn their end, the Nigerian presidency believes that Microsoft\u2019s extensive experience with using technology as an enabler for public and social good makes them an ideal partner.\n\nThis collaboration will focus on three major areas of development. Connectivity, skilling and digital transformation. Microsoft says after extensive consultation with the Nigerian government, they identified these three areas as key pillars to building strong foundations for a digital economy in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft partnered with IT firm Tek Experts, to create a Customer Support Centre in Lagos. The centre, according to them, employs over 1,600 people. This new digital initiative is another opportunity the tech company has to broaden their investment even more in Nigeria.\n\nBrad Smith said in a tweet that the company believes in the future of Nigeria and that they are excited about this partnership.\n\nThe initiative will also help protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural heritage. Microsoft will deploy artificial intelligence tools to protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural treasures for generations to come. They will do this alongside the National Institute of Cultural Orientation to revive and preserve the country\u2019s three major indigenous languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.\n\n\u201cThis is one of my favourite projects that we pursue around the world. It uses the most advanced technology of the 21st century to nurture and keep alive the culture that has been so important for humanity from the centuries past,\u201d Brad says.",

Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden with the associated annual productivity losses estimated to be over $25.4 billion. The leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.\n\nSTRAP has developed a range of hardware and software solutions that address the mobility challenges that the blind and visually impaired encounter daily. After years of R&D and extensive testing, STRAP has integrated its solutions into a lightweight, chest-worn device that guides the blind and visually impaired by calculating the proximity of physical environments, allowing them to move unaided. This hands-free wearable harness uses haptic language to warn of hazards like an oncoming passer-by, walls, steps, and even changing elevations on sidewalks and other pathways. The company has received significant pre-orders from over 6,000 customers across North & Latin America and will ship its devices in Q4 2021. For a video overview of STRAP\u2019s technology in action, click here.\n\nThe company is also backed by International Accelerator and a group of Angel Investors. As part of Platform Capital\u2019s investment, Dr. Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Platform Capital, joins the Board of STRAP.\n\nDiego Roel, Founder and CEO of STRAP Technologies said \u201cSTRAP is the first assistive technology on the market that replaces the white cane that\u2019s been in use for over 100 years. I am inspired and excited by this recent investment and support in what STRAP is doing. The investment represents the belief in what we have accomplished and what we have been passionately working on these last three years in research and development. We appreciate the confidence of our investors in STRAP and strengthening our position for the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Ponmile Osibo, Partner at Platform Capital said \u201cWe are proud to partner with STRAP Technologies. Their innovative solution provides an exciting alternative for the white cane. We believe that this technology will impact millions of lives globally. We look forward to working with the STRAP team to scale and to ensure that visually impaired people can live dignified & independent lives without guides or the white cane.\u201d\n\nAbout STRAP Technologies\n\nSTRAP Technologies mission is to bring increased independence and autonomy to the visually impaired through the development of the world\u2019s first substitute for the white cane. Their featured product, STRAP, is a state-of-the-art wearable device that enables blind and visually impaired people to detect and respond to any type of obstacle and notify them of possible collisions.\n\nThe device is now available for pre-order with a limited promotional price of $500 USD. With a $50 USD deposit now, the remainder is due prior to shipping later this year.\n\nwww.strap.tech\n\nAbout Platform Capital\n\nPlatform Capital is a growth markets focused, sector agnostic, principal investment and advisory firm.

          "text": "From FirstBank PR dept.\n\nIf you live in Lagos, Abuja or Port Harcourt, or you reside in any of the other state capitals, you probably take for granted that you actually live in the better of the two worlds that make up Nigeria when it comes to banking. Take Lagos, for example, you would find a bank in almost any corner you turn. You have many streets in business or commercial areas in the city that are lined up by nothing but banks in all their glory and magnificence. If a count is taken, it could be established that there are probably more bank branches in Lagos than any other branded business outlets or branded activity centres \u2013 if street stores and religious centres are excluded.\n\nMany people in city centres somehow assume that this situation of banks being in your face in cities is the same reality that prevails in most parts of the country. They have no idea that there are parts of Nigeria, especially the hinterland, where people take the absence of banks for granted the same way city dwellers take the preponderance of bank branches for granted. To get to the nearest bank, people in the hinterland who live this reality every day would have to travel many kilometres to get to their state capitals or some other large towns. These are the people living in the worse of the two worlds you find in Nigeria as far as having bank presence is concerned.\n\nImagine if the situation were reversed and city dwellers had to travel many kilometres to get to the nearest bank branch where they could do their transactions. It is not unlikely that such a situation would be accompanied by a ballooning of the stress levels in city dwellers, increased road rage on city highways and heightened frustration generally. How would people who spend multiple hours in traffic on a daily basis, work longer than counterparts elsewhere for far less remuneration, enjoy less sleep on their beds and less time with family and loved ones, cope with the additional burden of walking or driving endlessly in search of a bank to do their transactions? How? Just how?\n\nSo city dwellers should indeed be thankful for their world. And while at it, they as well as people in the hinterland, who live in the other world, should not be shy to extend appreciation to those working so hard and tirelessly to bridge the gap between the two worlds in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) financial inclusion initiative geared towards bringing the unbanked and underbanked as well as communities in Nigeria\u2019s hinterland into the formal financial ecosystem has been key to efforts to bridge the gap. The CBN\u2019s mandate to ensure the availability of affordable financial products and services to all individuals and groups of people in Nigeria, regardless of location, literacy level, familiarity with technology or accessibility to modern infrastructural facilities, has been wholly embraced, supported and promoted by FirstBank.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s unmatched commitment to financial inclusion is informed by the bank\u2019s undivided focus on making real impact across Nigeria. Hear Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, the Chief Executive Officer of the premier bank in West Africa and the leading financial inclusion services provider in Nigeria for over 127 years: \u201cThe key strength of our franchise is our ability to look at gaps in the society and develop products and services that [address those gaps].\u201d Continuing, he notes that as an integral part of the bank\u2019s strategy, \u201cWe believe that by significantly working with the Central Bank to improve the financial inclusion index of the country, we would, as FirstBank, be assisting [the] country to address poverty, to address hunger, thereby also promoting security of life and property because when people are gainfully employed, the implication is that they think less of crime.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that FirstBank has driven the financial inclusion initiative much more vigorously than any other bank in Nigeria, with its Firstmonie Agent channel, which crossed the 100,000 Agents mark a few days ago, being among the bank\u2019s many initiatives to expand financial access in the country. The 100,000 Agents feat in itself speaks volumes about the bank\u2019s strides in the financial inclusion space. No other bank comes anywhere close to FirstBank in terms of number and spread of agents in their agent banking networks. FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie Agents and the thousands of staff they employ are in all the 774 local government areas in Nigeria save two and, in 2020 alone, processed over 295 million transactions with a total value of N6.65 trillion and opened more than 196,000 accounts. However, for FirstBank, it is not about number or competition with others or even being the largest bank-led network in Africa, but the impact the Firstmonie Agents channel it is creating, as Dr Adeduntan highlighted above. His deputy, Francis Shobo agrees, saying FirstBank is looking beyond numbers and considering impact. He makes a bold declaration, \u201cWe are trying to make those Agents the centre of the financial ecosystem in the country.\u201d This probably explains why Firstmonie Agents are considered by the bank as community heroes that it is planting all over the nation. And this is the sense one gets in interviews with Agents and customers across the country.\n\nAiyetoro is a riverine community in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State. It has no banks, according to Stephen Adeleye, a Firstmonie Agent serving Aiyetoro community. He recounts how Firstmonie has impacted his community. Adeleye says Firstmonie has provided easy access to banking ensuring that \u201cpeople in the community now have this kind of savings habit\u201d \u2013 a reference to the growing savings culture in Aiyetoro. One of his customers, Tina Farodoye, who operates a grocery store in the community says Firstmonie has helped her business to grow. She can now buy her stock in bulk all the way from Lagos where they are relatively inexpensive (even with transport costs added) compared to her community, all because she is able to transfer funds through Agent Stephen to the wholesalers in Lagos. This has improved her business profitability by increasing the profit margin in her business.\n\nEphraim Osinachi, is a Firstmonie Agent in Obehie, Asa Ukwa West, Abia State. He serves customers across all ages, including the very aged, as all customers are assisted with their transactions, unlike the use of ATM where the customer is practically on their own. He says market traders take advantage of his presence in the community to make lodgements at the end of the day\u2019s trade. He and his staff wait until traders are done at the market (unlike your regular banks which shut their doors to customers at four o\u2019clock, generally). The advantage this offers the people is invaluable. He cites a case where a customer\u2019s house was raided by robbers in their absence and all the robbers could find after ransacking the entire house was fifty naira cash and old phones valued at N3,000. His services are enabling his community to avoid keeping bulk cash at home and the consequent risk of being robbed and traumatised by men of the underworld.\n\nOrode Hesse, Firstmonie Agent in Ubeji, Warri South, Delta State is both emphatic and ecstatic about impact Firstmonie has had on her life. She enthuses that it has really impacted and empowered her financially and enabled her to empower others, especially other women. She has six employees, five of whom are female. So she sees Firstmonie as a business or platform to employ and empower women. Interestingly, Orode is part of the 26 per cent of Firstmonie Agents that are women, a fact that points to the important role Firstmonie is playing in driving women economic empowerment.\n\nAbubakar Aki Bolaji, is a Firstmonie Agent along Karishi Road, Orozo in FCT, Abuja. He points out that the nearest bank to his community is 15km away. He is pleased that his presence as an Agent in the community has cut out the costs of transportation his people would have continued to incur in order to access banking services. His sentiment and delight are shared by the teeming customers he serves. This situation is very common in the North given its landmass and the dispersed nature of human settlements. Dr Adeduntan relates how a senior government official in Jigawa State highlighted how important the presence of Firstmonie Agents was when he informed him that all across a 70km stretch from Gumel, where there was the branch of a bank, there were no banks anywhere in sight. All he saw were at least two Firstmonie Agents in that long stretch of 70km, no banks. Without those two Agents, all the people in the settlements along that 70km stretch would be without access to banking services.\n\nAnother Firstmonie Agent, Mohammed Tatari, serving Tudun Wada in Bununu, Bauchi State, says his services are helping to drive commerce in his community as traders are now able to transfer funds to the wholesalers elsewhere from whom they buy. His services are helping traders to avoid carrying large cash with them given the dire security situation. He noted that the people used to travel elsewhere just to access banking service. His presence has changed all that now. He concludes that Firstmonie is changing his community (for good). One woman who would agree with him is Halima, a housewife and petty trader in the outskirts of Abuja. She discovered Firstmonie through her co-tenant, during the recent lockdown due to COVID-19, and was excited that she could access funds at the Firstmonie Agent outlet close to her and send money to her mother in far away, Maiduguri in Borno State. She had been unable to move to Garki where her bank branch was because of the lockdown.\n\nBesides ensuring that individuals in the suburbs do not have to travel for long hours to the city for their banking activities, Firstmonie Agents are also bridging the gap between the tech-savvy and the low-literacy clients as the Agent network represents the convenient and comfortable alternative for customers that are unacquainted with sophisticated digital channels. And as Firstmonie Agents give their best, FirstBank, on its part, has been doing everything to encourage the Agents. In its inaugural Firstmonie Agent Banking Awards, FirstBank rewarded 37 leading Agents that have promoted financial inclusion in the country. Thirty-one (31) Agents each won the sum of N250,000 at the state level while five Agents won the sum of N1,000,000 at the regional level. At the national level, the grand prize of N2,500,000 was won by Zayyanu Hassan Ishaq, an Agent from Abuja (North Central), who described it as a miracle and noted that it would spur him to work harder.\n\nAs further encouragement and to promote the business activities of Firstmonie Agents, the bank announced the provision of loan facilities of up to N1,000,000 to the Agents. This new credit scheme, which they can access 24 hours a day, can be processed in less than two minutes. The scheme means more empowerment and business expansion for Firstmonie Agents. And the expansion can go beyond Nigeria as Dr Adeduntan says FirstBank is looking beyond Nigeria to other African countries where FirstBank operates, like Ghana and DRC \u2013 a country with over 80 million people \u2013 to promote financial inclusion and begin to address poverty on the African continent through the Firstmonie platform.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun State Commissioner for Works and Transportation, Engr. Remi Omowaiye, has said the administration Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is more committed to infrastructural and human capital development in the state, just as he reiterated the administration\u2019s commitment to complete Olaiya Flyover within the stipulated nine months period.\n\nOmowaiye in the company of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Transportation, Engr Toke Olaniyan disclosed this on Monday while speaking with journalists after the inspection of the ongoing Olaiya flyover project.\n\nHe said the pace at which the project is going was highly encouraging, adding that all the necessary material needed have been on ground for the speedy completion of the project.\n\nOmowaiye who was highly elated over speed of the project, said despite the ongoing flyover project, all other road projects across the state are not being affected.\n\nIt would be recalled that Governor Oyetola on February 28, 2021, flagged off the construction of Olaiya flyover in Osogbo.\n\nThe N2.7 billion flyover, handled by Messrs Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited, is a 4-span of 15m each, with two Underpass bays for U-turning to Fakunle/Justrite and MDS/Post Office.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWe started this project three months ago, we are in the activity of the fourth month, which means we are going to finish this project under nine months. Work rate here is over 30 percent, which is an indication that we are moving faster than we envisaged.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we do not compromise standards, all regulatory bodies come here often and they see that we don\u2019t compromise standards.\n\n\u201cBefore we started this project, we carried out our environmental impact assessment to look at the impact of the closure of Olaiya on the immediate environment. We kept on reviewing the impact and I can tell you we are able to manage all the challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile we are waiting for piles to cast, we started doing drainage which supposed to be activities of week five but instead of us to wait we started to do drainages.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cWhat is important is not the percentage of construction but the fact that we are running the projects on the site simultaneously. Everything that is needed for the construction is on ground.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed the insinuation that the flyover project is the contractor\u2019s first major project, saying that besides being an indigenous contractor, he has also handled over 100 projects in known states of the country, including bridges.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the contractor handling the project has not done a major project before. It was not only the company that bided, we have two companies. The contractor has done projects in Akwa Ibom, he is doing two in Oyo State and he has done over 100 big contracts in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the contractor is an indigene of Osun, his corporate social responsibility is coming back to the State, besides, he can stand shoulder to shoulder with international contractors in terms of quality service delivery. He is a contractor we can vouch for, we have looked at his pedigree before we consider him.\n\n\u201cThe one he did in Akwa Ibom was done six to seven years ago which was constructed on the water. Our own here is even better, it is standing on a rock\u201d Omowaye added.\n\nSpeaking on the present administration\u2019s commitment to infrastructural development, Omowaiye noted that at the moment, not less than 10 township road projects are ongoing, adding that over 20 major township roads would be commissioned before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have not less than 10 township roads projects ongoing across the state. The flyover project is not even affecting other ongoing projects. Orioke Pure Water road project is ongoing, Lautech /Ajegunle road project, Ona baba Ona road. All these road projects are ongoing.\n\n\u201cKelebe /Iragbiji road almost completed and it\u2019s new road that we just opened up. Ido Osun township road, Kuta Township road, Ife township roads are ongoing. All the roads projects we inherited from the last administration. Iperindo/Ipetu-Ijesa road among others.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over 5 billion naira on the road projects inherited from the last administration. Akoda/Gbongan road, Ada Igbajo road which has reached 90% completion.\n\n\u201cAny moment from now, we are going to award Lawyer Atanda road in Iwo. Aleluya road, Lameco/Okinni/Icon/Ilobu road about 11 KLM road. Modakeke /Famia road has completed before we later approved another 1klm. In Ife north, Ipetu, Moro, Yakoyo road project already completed.\n\n\u201cIla-Orangun road about 10 KLM is undergoing procurement, as a matter of fact, over 20 major road projects will be completed and commissioned before the end of this year,\u201d Omowaiye said.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nDetermined to strictly follow the process of conversion of voting units in the country to polling units, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday commenced nationwide verification exercise for proposed centres.\n\nChairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu kick- started this on Tuesday when he visited some of the proposed centres and existing polling units in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Nasarawa State.\n\nLeading other top INEC officials and journalists, Yakubu told newsmen at the Commission\u2019s LG office Karu, Nasarawa State, said the purpose of the verification exercise was to ensure that right thing was done in the conversion of the voting points to polling units.\n\n\u201cAll the National Commissioners are out, visiting the states of the Federation to verify the work of converting the voting points to polling units.\n\n\u201c So, we decided from the headquarters to visit some of the polling units and voting points in the FCT and also in the Karu Local Government, Nasarawa State. We have done that of FCT. We are now in Karu.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that as part of our engagement with stakeholders, we show images of one of the congested polling units in the country from Karu in Nasarawa State.\n\n\u201cSo, I have to verify that the right thing is being done in converting those voting points to polling units and relocating them in line with the Commission\u2019s guidelines.\n\n\u201cSo far, it is work in progress. At the end of the exercise will address the media.\u201d\n\nThe INEC Chairman said he had been informed that 395 voting points were being converted to polling units in Karu Local Government.\n\nThe chairman said that with the conversion of voting points to polling units, there would be expanded access to polling units for voters, while congestion of polling units would be eliminated in future elections.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done, basically, is to build on what we did in 2019. Recall that we are converting the voting points used for the 2019 elections into autonomous polling units and relocating them.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a continuous process. One exercise will not solve the problem, but we hope we have established the mechanism that going forward, the commission will be adjusting the number of polling units as the number of registered voters increases.\u201d\n\nHe assured that when the Continuous Voters Registration exercise commenced in June 28 after the PUs conversion, voters would be given the opportunity to choose the location they wish to be their new polling units.\n\nHe urged stakeholders and community leaders to support the commission and sensitise the people on the ongoing exercise for conversion of polling units.\n\nSome of the center visited by Yakubu include PUs located in Government Secondary School Life Camp, Apo Legislative Quarters, and Zone-D entrance gate Apo, in to the FCT\n\nOther include the commission\u2019s office in Mararaba, Karu Local Government office and Karu International market in Nasarawa State.",

          "text": "A market survey in the region shows that block makers are shutting down\n\nBy Our Reporters\n\nCement prices have increased by 67-100 per cent in the South East states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, hitting as high as N4,500 in Abakaliki.\n\nA market survey conducted by NAN at various wholesale and retail shops in the zone shows that the price of the product has increased almost by 100 % when compared to the price in 2020.\n\nA cement dealer at Kenyatta Market in Enugu State capital, Mr Ifeanyi Amadi said the increase in the product\u2019s price started last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increase in dollar exchange.\n\nHe noted that a trailer load of Dangote cement with 600 bags initially sold at N1.5 million in 2020 but is now N2.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother retailer at Uwani, Samuel Uwakwe, said he was surprised at the rate prices of the product in the country.\n\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\n\nUwakwe lamented that few individuals were given opportunity to supply the product and pleaded with suppliers to reduce the prices and make it available for the citizens.\n\nHe maintained that the prices would likely crash during raining season.\n\nA block maker, Mr Albert Okechukwu noted that increase in the price of the product affected his business as he still sold six-inch and nine-inch block at N170 and N180 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is the same price we sold last year and it is same till date because we cannot change prices in order to retain our customers but most block industries have reduced quality of their blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nA site Engineer, Mr Emma Ugwuoke said he wanted to start a building in the village when the price was N2,800 last year but was waiting to see if it would come down.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back next time, I was told it was N3, 000 and to my greatest surprise, they sell N3,900 and N4,000 now in my village.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing one can do than to buy it like that. I want government to do something urgently about it because it is frustrating buying cement at that price,\u201d Ugwuoke said.\n\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\n\nThose who spoke to NAN said the price hike had further dashed the hope of many Nigerians, wishing to own their personal homes.\n\nA businessman, Mr Victor Ugwu, said he had to suspend his building project because of the \u201cunfortunate development\u201d.\n\nUgwu said: \u201cI have stopped my project for now. I cannot afford to continue with the current price of the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe economy is very bad so I hope to wait until there is a drop in the price.\n\n\u201cI think the hike can be attributed to the monopoly being enjoyed by the cement producers in the country. Unfortunately, there may not be any respite until that monopoly is broken.\u201d\n\nHowever, a cement dealer, Mr James Ogbonna, said the problem had nothing to do with the manufacturers of the commodity.\n\nRather, Ogbonna blamed the price hike on the activities of \u201cshylock distributors\u201d of cement.\n\nHe said that the hike had affected his business adversely, adding that cement patronage had been at the lowest ebb, since the price hike.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first and second week of March, we sold a bag for N3,200, but within the third week we started selling at N3,500.\n\n\u201cBy the end of March, the price moved up to N4,000 and now, we sell between N4,000 and N4100, depending on the brand.\u201d\n\nAnother dealer, Mr Godwin Okafor, said that his sales had dropped drastically as a result of the hike.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of challenges in this cement business now. When we make deposit and order for the goods, it takes about one month before we get delivery,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in Awka in Anambra as stakeholders decry the situation.\n\nMr Kenechukwu Okoye, a cement dealer along Zik Avenue, Awka said before the #EndSARS protest in 2020, a 50kg bag of cement was sold at N2,500.\n\n\u201cShortly after the #EndSARS, the price rose to N3,000 and from there to the present price of N4,000 and N4,100, we are selling today,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye said though the distributors initially blamed the problem on difficulties encountered by the hauling firm transporting the product, the situation had come to stay.\n\nIn Owerri, Imo capital, price of cement is between N3,850 and N4300, depending on the brand.\n\nAt the Building Materials Market in Naze, Owerri North Local Government Area, Dangote and BUA cement are sold at N4,000 per bag while BUA and UNICEM are sold for N3,900.\n\nMr Okechukwu Okonya, a seller, said the cost could be attributed to high cost of transportation as a result of fuel price.\n\nOkonya also said major dealers sometimes hoard the product in their warehouses to create artificial scarcity.\n\nAnother trader, Mr Marcel Iwu, agreed that although there had been hoarding by major dealers, manufacturers had also complained of increased cost of raw materials.\n\nIwu added that the prices could go higher or reduce at any given time, noting that even if prices fall, traders would want to sell off their old stock at higher rates.\n\nIn Abakaliki, Ebonyi, prices of almost all building materials have gone up.\n\nThe prices of cement, rods of various sizes, corrugated roofing sheets and other building materials and accessories according to NAN findings have been on the increase since January.\n\nThe price of Dangote and Bua which sold at N2,500 earlier in November and December 2020 now sold between N4000 and N4500.\n\nSimilarly, Unicem cement which also sold at N2,300 within the same period had also gone up to N4,000 and N4,300.\n\nMr John Okoh, a cement dealer at Kpiri-Kpiri market in an interview with NAN attributed the development to lack of price control mechanism and high rate of exchange rate of the Naira against the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe development is indeed affecting sales and business because many builders have put a stop to their building and other construction projects because they cannot cope with the present high cost of the product.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Clement Igbo, who owns a block moulding factory, said that the high cost of cement was hampering production, saying that he no longer produced maximally due to lack of buyers.\n\n\u201cA bag of Dangote cement which is one of the best products for our business is selling for N4500 and it is difficult to buy at this prevailing price and make enough production.\n\n\u201cWe sell six inch and nine-inch block before this price increase at N150 and N200 but now 6 inch-block is sold at N220 while the 9-inch sells for between N250 and N300 respectively.\n\n\u201cMany block industries in the town have closed down production while some have compromised standard which pose great dangers to the building industry,\u201d Igbo said.\n\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\nMr Jerry Onwe, an economic activist urged the Federal and state governments to revive moribund cement factories across the states to meet the increasing demands of cement consumption in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the quest for mass housing for poor Nigerians would remain elusive if urgent steps were not taken to address the high cost of building materials in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where an average worker earns N30,000 monthly as take-home wage, how can such a person afford a house of his own in view of the prevailing price of building materials?\n\n\u201cWe have reached a cross road as far as the issue of building materials is concerned and this is a time for government to intervene and bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",

          "text": "May 3, 2021 586\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.",

          "title": "Worsening Apapa Gridlock Amidst NPA Electronic Call-up System",
          "text": "April 29, 2021 559\n\nPort users, commuters and other motorists are currently groaning over the worsening gridlock on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway and along the Marine Bridge, Ijora, as trailers and tanker drivers have taken over these routes despite the implementation of the electronic call-up system by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock. Under the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\n\nHowever, two months into the implementation of the new system, there seems to be no end in sight to the intractable gridlock with NPA and Lagos State Government appearing helpless as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately on the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some truck drivers, due to the alleged slow process in booking of trucks by the Truck Transit Park (TTP), the company managing the eto application, have abandoned the designated parks to remain on the roads and bridges where they bribe their way into the port with fake e-call up slip in connivance with security personnel deployed to manage the gridlock.\n\nThe action by these truck drivers, coupled with the poor access roads and ongoing construction along the Mile Two-Tin Can Island Port road, has compounded the gridlock as motorists spent several hours trying to get into Apapa yesterday.\n\nAll the major roads into Apapa were completely taken over by trucks and petroleum tankers yesterday. The traffic stretched to other major highways including Eko Bridge and Ikorodu Road.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Directs NSCDC To Collaborate With Other Agencies To Prevent Attacks At Airports\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Stanley Ezenga, said there has not been any respite on the road despite the e-call up system, which he said has become a money-making venture for some people benefiting from the situation.\n\nHe said the traffic situation persists due to poor access roads and the failure of the government to prevail on the contractor handling the construction of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to expedite action.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature. The e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it. For each call up, trucks pay N10,000 but this is just the official money. They still part with other money being given to security operatives before they get to the port.\n\n\u201cSo who is fooling who? From the onset, I know there will be issues with the e-call up because the main issue that has to do with the gridlock coupled with the state of the road has not been addressed. You can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Navy, created a task force but the gridlock has negated all of them. The e-call up is not working. That is why the gridlock is still there. It is the same road the trucks will pass when they are called and when they are not called upon and yet the issues that made them to be on the road have not been addressed.\u201d",

          "title": "The Nigerian Telecom Sector Can Breathe Again",
          "text": "April 29, 2021 440\n\nA week is a week. This is almost true in every part of the world regardless of the season. Every week is also unique. The activities, the happenings, and the stories define each week.\n\n*This week has been epoch-making in every sense. This week, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd. The verdict was unanimous. He was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for over 9mins. George in pleading for his life kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Philonise Floyd, George\u2019s brother said that he\u2019s \u201cable to breathe again\u201d.\n\nThe feeling of relief was widespread. It was a sigh of relief heard around the world. We can all breathe again.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government lifted the ban on sales of SIM cards.\n\nOfficially, it meant that the telcos could resume sales of SIM cards after months of suspension. The sector and indeed Nigerian telecom services consumers were able to breathe again.\n\nDuring the ban, countless people who had lost their phones or damaged their SIM cards couldn\u2019t retrieve them. Visitors to the country couldn\u2019t get SIMs and businesses that depended on SIM card sales suffered. Millions were thrown out of jobs, sales outlets shut down and operators lost revenue. The last five months were a real chokehold on the telecommunications industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Employment Statistics: World Bank, FG To Discuss Modalities Of Data Collection\n\nConservatives reports indicate that the number of connected lines dropped by over 10 million lines. Think, loss in revenue to the telecom services providers and endless pain for the customers who couldn\u2019t connect with family, friends, or business. It was a chokehold.\n\nNo wonder the sector couldn\u2019t breathe. Little wonder the economy recorded a rise in the number of unemployed and more citizens dropped into the poverty zone. The country couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nSince nature abhors a vacuum, it didn\u2019t take long for illegal sales of pre-registered SIMs to gain ground. This is a story for another week.\n\nThe biggest loss was that the objective was lost to all but the initiators. It was a chokehold on the economy, Nigerians couldn\u2019t breathe and nobody knew why.\n\nFirst, a little context. The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, had in December 2020 ordered the suspension of the sales and activation of new SIM cards across all phone networks in the country. Through the NCC, he directed Nigerians to ensure that their phone lines were connected to their National Identification Numbers (NIN) or risk losing the lines.\n\nNow, the suspension was expected, at the time, to last till the completion of the NIN registration. The date fixed was early January.\n\nExperts swore that it was an impossible mission. For in a decade, the NIMC registered less than 50 million people, how can the same organization be reasonably expected to sign on over 50 million people in under six weeks? The experts were right.\n\nSo, it was no surprise therefore that the deadlines had to be shifted repeatedly. The humongous crowd at the registration centres made Nigerians criticised the government for not making adequate provisions before the directive went into effect.\n\nBanning SIM sales precipitated what appears to be several unintended consequences. The number of internet subscribers dropped, no doubt, limiting the chance of meeting the NCC set broadband target.\n\nIn these days of reducing average revenue per user (ARPU), it is a case of declining revenue for the operators.\n\nWhile telcos can\u2019t be expected to complain openly, the impact was an open wound. It was visible for all to see.\n\nThe pain is equally real. Job loss. Revenue loss.\n\nAt a time, when the economy is witnessing diminishing revenues, these losses also mean a reduction in taxes payable to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the government\u2019s actions with its regulations. The situation is typical. The telecommunications industry is making massive contributions to the GDP, yet it was placed in a chokehold and left struggling to breathe.\n\nThankfully, this week, the sector can breathe again. Yes, Nigerians can breathe again.\n\nDarnella Frazier, the teenager whose viral video of George Floyd\u2019s murder helped the case, has been praised for her bravery. It would also be proper to laud all the analysts and writers who pushed tirelessly for the resumption of SIM sales in Nigeria.\n\nElvis Eromosele, a Corporate Communication professional and public affairs analyst lives in Lagos\n\n* Article was written a week prior publication.",
