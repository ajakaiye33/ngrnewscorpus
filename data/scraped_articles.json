          "text": "Seventeen Southern governors seemed to knock out secessionist calls on Tuesday when they restated their commitment to the unity of the Nigeria. The governors, however, seek the restructuring of the country, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments, amongst others.\n\nThis was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of a meeting of the governors of Southern Nigeria in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nThe governors, amongst other things, also banned open grazing, called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to convoke a national dialogue to address widespread agitations amongst various groups in the region.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 signed by the 17 governors partly read, \u201cAt its meeting, held today, 11th May, 2021, the Southern Governors Forum reviewed the situation in the nation generally and focused on the current security situation, agitations/restructuring, prospect for inter-state collaboration and partnerships as well as on the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising from the meeting, the Forum:\n\n\u201cAffirmed that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for econom\u00edc development and prosperity;\n\n\u201cAgreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism;\n\n\u201cRecommended that in view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency;\n\n\u201cRecommended that in deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government Agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogenous.\u201d\n\nLately, secessionist calls have increased across the country especially in Southern Nigeria. From the Indigenous People of Biafra to agitators of Yoruba Nation, amongst others, the separatist calls rise, fueled by the unprecedented insecurity in the country as well as the supposed nepotism and unequal distribution of economic resources by the Buhari government.",

          "title": "Robbery attempt in Aso Rock shows no Nigerian is safe \u2013Ozekhome",
          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, says the burglary attempt by armed robbers on the Aso Rock residence of the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari, shows there is no security anywhere in the country and no Nigerian is safe.\n\nOzekhome, who described the robbery attempt as shameful and disgusting, made this known in a statement on Tuesday obtained by The PUNCH. It was titled, \u2018Burglary In The Villa: When The Chicken Comes Home To Roost\u2019.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said there was an attempt by armed robbers to burgle the residence of Gambari, early Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari has confirmed that there \u2018was a foolish attempt\u2019 to burgle his residence at 3:00am this morning but it turned out to be unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cProfessor Gambari, whose house is on a street next to the Villa has assured that there is nothing to worry about from the incident,\u201d Shehu had stated in a two-part tweet on Monday night.\n\nThe disclosure caused a stir in the country as common Nigerians wonder what becomes of their fate if the presidency, with its entire security fortress, could be invaded by armed robbers who further launched a burglary attempt.\n\nReacting on Tuesday, Ozekhome said, \u201cI am not surprised to hear that the official residence of the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari inside Aso Villa has been burgled. It is still a wonder, indeed a miracle, for which I am grateful to God, that Nigeria herself has not still been physically abducted and kidnapped as a country, though she has since been abducted and kidnapped, literally, in terms of economy, corruption, nepotism, cronyism, prebendalism, crass tribalism and religious bigotry. There is no security anywhere in the land.\n\n\u201cBoko haram are only kilometers away from the federal seat of government in Abuja. In Niger State, they have since planted their flags of sovereignty over many Nigerian territories. The Governor himself said so\u2026Whether in the air, on water, or by road, or in the markets, malls, schools, churches, mosques, streets, alleys, government seats, Nigerians are not safe from rampaging marauders.\n\n\u201cThe burglary of a whole Chief of Staff\u2019s residence therefore merely points to the dire times and vulnerability of all. After all, if gold rusts, what will iron do? One of the greatest signs of a failed state is when there is balance of power of violence and control over instruments of terror between a legitimate government and non-state actors, such as terrorists, armed bandits, kidnappers, etc. That is where we are today unfortunately.\n\n\u201cIt blames every person and all others, but itself. It still blames the PDP that it snatched power from in an unfair election 6 whopping years ago!\n\n\u201cNow, it has invented rumours of a possible coup against it as a not so ingenious strategy of distraction from its woeful performance and abysmal failure. So shameful and disgusting. Nigeria, we hail thee.\u201d",

It is a call for responsibility, in the national interest,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister also appealed to all Nigerians to continue to support security agencies who are working daily to protect them.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for good as individuals, as families and as a denomination.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdeboye described his late son, Dare, as a \u201cchampion\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cCry if you wish but don\u2019t cry for Pastor Dee (as Dare is fondly called) because he is resting in glory. Cry because you are the one still fighting the battle.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has caught a glimpse of heaven will not be crying for Pastor Dee because there is no comparison between heaven and earth.

We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for our good.\n\n\u201cIn one of his sermons, Dare himself said God does not need a visa to pay you a visit or to do whatever he wants to do in your life.\n\n\u201cAnd I have told you before death is not a function of age. Young people die, old people die, children die. And it is not about how long you live it is how well. Even Jesus Christ himself died at the age of 33. John the Baptist never lived to be 34 and yet he was the greatest.\n\n\u201cWe have lost a champion. You would agree with me on that. Let us consider him a seed that we have sown and let\u2019s get ready for a special harvest.\n\n\u201cI want us to join our forces together and produce many champions like Damilare that would go round the whole world and shake the world for the Lord Jesus. That is how we can honour his memory.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe church of God is marching on. It doesn\u2019t matter what the devil is thinking now.\n\n\u201cThe devil was rejoicing the day the Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross but he never knew what was coming.

          "title": "Orji: How NSIA Tripled Profits in 2020",
          "text": "Says Abacha\u2019s $311m refund intact\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Managing Director of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr Uche Orji, Tuesday disclosed that the organisation which manages the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund tripled its profits in 2020.\n\nSpeaking when he appeared on the \u201cGood Morning Show\u201d on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Orji attributed the relative success recorded by the NSIA last year to the business decisions taken by the authority.\n\nHe explained that some of NSIA\u2019s portfolios were up by as much as 50 per cent in dollar terms in 2020, predicting that although the financial technology sector ruled the market last year, there will be a broader profit ecosystem this year as countries continue to open up on the back of increasing Covid-19 vaccine jabs.\n\nThe NSIA helmsman noted that the body had been aggressive in terms of its focus on international equities, private equity investments, venture capital and direct investments in the international market, where much of the profits came from.\n\nHe disclosed that with the exception of just one or two portfolios, every single asset class made substantial returns to the NSIA last year, with the headline number being N160 billion , while the net profit stood at N108.9 billion\n\nFor the 2019 financial year, the NSIA had said it recorded a Total Comprehensive Income (TCI) of N36.1 5 billion, less than that of 2018, which was N44.34 billion.\n\n\u201cAll in all it was a very strong year. So in terms of the earnings highlights, there was also the impact of foreign currency positions on exchange rate devaluation.\n\n\u201cThe headline numbers for profits for 2020 was N160 billion, but if you take out about N51 billion that came from foreign currency positions and devaluations, the core earning was about N108.9 billion. So, it\u2019s quite strong and more than three times what we did in 2019,\u201d Orji stated during the interview.\n\nListing the investments by the authority, he mentioned that the Future Generations Fund had four categories which include public equities in which the NSIA has investments in Japan, United States, across Europe and in China.\n\nThe second category, he stated, is the hedge fund strategy, which includes micro to long-term equities and credit, adding that the organisation also has exposure in private equity across Nigeria and investments in healthcare, aircraft leasing companies, among others.\n\nHe predicted a broader recovery for the equity side of the investments this year, explaining that although stock market growth in 2020 was largely anchored on technology, he expects 2021 to be driven by aviation and the industrial sectors as the world opens up again.\n\nUche stated that fixed income should be closely watched by investors, except for the impact of inflation which he predicted would make interest rates go up and make fixed income instruments fall.\n\n\u201cMy view is that on the balance of risk , we are more likely to see interest rates go up than go down,\u201d the NSIA boss added, noting that venture capitalist funds were also being explored by the organisation.\n\n\u201cOn the average we had almost 30 per cent returns in dollar terms and we are going to be more aggressive in venture capital,\u201d he noted.\n\nUche emphasised that the NSIA was also investing in fintech , software services, data networking as well as biotech and pharmaceuticals, which he noted the authority made quite some money from.\n\nOn infrastructure, the NSIA MD pointed out that the organisation was participating through six areas, including agriculture with the fertiliser programme, roads and financial market infrastructure, with NSIA currently one of the largest investors in the country\u2019s infrastructure financing ecosystem.\n\nIn terms of healthcare, Orji further mentioned that the authority was intervening in the diagnostics and radiology centres in Kano and Umuahia and the cancer centres at the Lagos Nigeria University Teaching Hospital (LUTH)\n\nHe further stressed that the NSIA was in discussions with the University College London, to develop pharmaceutical industries in the country.\n\nOn the Abacha loot, he stated: \u201cThe Abacha fund was $311 million that was returned to Nigeria by the US Department of Justice and Island of Jersey and the agreement was to spread the money in equal measures across three projects.\n\n\u201cThese are the Lagos-Ibadan road, Abuja-Kano road and the Second Niger Bridge. Each of them will get $103million-$104 million. To spend the money we have been required to have external auditors aside our in-house auditors as Deloitte to monitor the disbursement of that fund.\n\n\u201cA civil society group, CLEEN foundation has been appointed by the ministry of justice and also with the US government to also supervise the disbursement of the fund. So, you can imagine that every single pair of eyes possible are overlooking how these funds will be disbursed.\n\n\u201cThe fund is still there intact. Not a dime has been spent. It is being held in our accounts with the central bank,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that another \u20ac4.2 was being expected to be repatriated, which the authorities have agreed should come to the NSIA to be used for the three projects, but noted that additional funds will be raised next year from Sukuk before the handover of the projects can be effected.\n\nOrji said the NSIA was partnering the ministry of works as well as the contractors handling the three mega projects to ensure they are promptly completed, with the Lagos-Ibadan expressway scheduled for inauguration before 2022 ending and the bridge slated for decking by December after Covid-19 disruptions earlier.\n\nHe stated that a huge portion of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway funding will be reclaimed since the road will be tolled.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How $1.5bn Channel Management, INTELS Contracts Pitted Amaechi against Bala-Usman",
          "text": "By Eromosele Abiodun\n\nLast week\u2019s suspension of Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, at the request of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, was the culmination of a two-year war of attrition between the duo, triggered by disagreement in 2019 over whether or not to renew the channel management contracts, THISDAY findings have shown.\n\nIt was learnt that the NPA had in 2019 placed advertisement in newspapers calling for expression of interest and bids.\n\nSources said three bid rounds were cancelled on the orders of the minister over disagreements on the selective bids and open bids.\n\nThe process was suspended till May 11, 2020, when the NPA placed advertisements calling for expression of interest, which was again moved to October 2020 because participants protested that they could not participate because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe channels in contention are: Lagos, Port Harcourt (Bonny) and Warri while Calabar is under litigation.\n\nEach channel management contract is valued at $100 million a year for five years making it $1.5 billion (N600 billion) for the three channels for the five years.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Amaechi had requested that two Chinese companies are selected to manage Bonny and Warri Channels, a request the NPA rejected because it violated due process.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that 12 companies submitted technical bids for Lagos Channel, 25 companies for Warri while 18 companies bid for Bonny.\n\nAt the end of the technical bid process, three companies were shortlisted for Bonny and Warri while two were selected for Lagos.\n\nFor the Warri Channel, Pelfaco Construction Nigeria Limited, Redstar and China Harbour (JV) and A.A Ranno were prequalified.\n\nFor Bonny, Bellsea Limited, CRBC and CDBHC Limited (JV) and Borno Energy Limited/Dact Energy (JV) were prequalified.\n\nJandnul Limited and Hankuff Services Nigeria Limited were prequalified for the Lagos Channel.\n\nThe companies prequalified submitted their commercial bids between January and February.\n\nCompetent sources at the Bureau of Public Procurement told THISDAY that three company\u2019s commercial bids were accepted as winners.\n\nThey are: Redstar Limited for Warri, Bellsea Limited for Bonny and Hancuff Services Limited for Lagos.\n\nThe battle between Amaechi and Bala-Usman further heightened this year when Amaechi wrote a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari requesting that INTELS Pilotage contract, which expired last year, be restored.\n\nIn a letter to Buhari in January 2021, Amaechi requested the restoration of all contracts between NPA and INTELS, which according to him, are now subject to legal disputes between the parties.\n\nThe minister also requested the withdrawal of all matters currently in court or at arbitration by both parties in order to enable him to resolve all pending issues \u2018administratively,\u201d a request that was granted by the president on January 22, 2021.\n\nHowever, following a request by the presidency, Bala-Usman, in a letter to the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari dated January 25, 2021, explained that the INTELS pilotage contract was not cancelled but had expired.\n\nShe also clarified that the NPA, contrary to claims, still have three contracts with INTELS, which include, the concession agreement for Onne Terminal A and B in Rivers State-commenced in 2005 and ending in 2030; the concession agreement for Calabar Terminal A in Calabar Port, Rivers State and concession for Warri New and Old Terminal, Delta Port, Delta State.\n\nBala-Usman, in the letter, stated: \u201cThe Service Boat Operation Management Agent contract commenced in June 2007 with a review of an extension of 10 years in 2011 to culminate in August 2020. The authority had in 2017 served INTELS with a notice of termination for its refusal to comply with the TSA policy of the federal government.\n\n\u201cFollowing the receipt of the notice, the company complied with the policy and a supplemental agreement was signed to recognise the compliance to TSA and the notice of termination was accordingly withdrawn.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the agreement with INTELS on this service was not terminated but it reached the end of its contractual period in August 2020. In compliance with the Public Procurement Act (PPA), the authority in December 2019 initiated a public tender process in anticipation of the expiration of the contract for the appointment of a contractor to provide the authority with that service.\u201d\n\nShe added that INTELS along with other bidders submitted their bids to qualify for the tender but that INTELS violated one of the criteria advertised for the tender and was disqualified.\n\nWhile this was ongoing, Amaechi wrote another letter to Buhari alleging a shortfall in operating surpluses by the NPA requesting that she be suspended.\n\nThis move, THISDAY learnt, was against the advice of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) who warned against the request in a letter to Amaechi.\n\nThe AuGF, in a letter dated April 16, 2021, had pointed out that NPA\u2019s account for the period, except 2019, which is awaiting NPA\u2019s board approval, had been audited and available.\n\nThe AuGF, Mr. Aghughu Adolphus, in the letter personally signed, said: \u201cI write to respond to your letter reference number FMOT/F&A/ AuGF/2017/4/T dated April 6, 2021, especially with particular reference to paragraph two of the letter and wish to state the position of the AuGF with regards to your request. With particular reference to paragraph 20, \u201cAnnual Estimates and audit,\u201d the Act number 38 of 1999 establishing the NPA and Sec. 85 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), I humbly advise as follows: \u201cThe board shall cause to be kept proper accounts of the authority and proper records, in relation thereto and when certified by the board, the accounts shall be audited by auditors appointed by the authority from the list and in accordance with the guidelines supplied by the AuGF.\n\n\u201cNothing in sub-sec, two of this section shall be construed as authorising the AuGF to audit the accounts of or appoint auditors for government statutory corporations, commissions, authorities, agencies, including all persons and bodies established by an act of the National Assembly, but the Auditor General shall: A. provide such bodies with: 1. A list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors and from which the bodies shall appoint their external auditors, and 2. Guidelines on the level of fees to be paid to external auditors and B. Comment on their accounts and auditors reports thereon.\n\n\u201cIn line with I and 2 above, I wish to state that: The NPA board has duly engaged the external audit firms- Messrs Muhtari Dangama & Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants. The said audit firms audited and published the audited accounts of NPA duly approved by the board for the years ended: December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF added that the audit of 2019 by Messrs Muhtari Dangama & Co and SIAO Chartered Accountants was ongoing and awaiting NPA board\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlso, my office has conducted periodic checks for the years 2016-2018, and issued periodic checks reports along with comments on their annual accounts and auditor\u2019s reports thereon, and reputable professional audit firms are already being engaged by the NPA board in line with the enabling Act \u2013 hence no justification for the Ministry \u201cto advertise and select qualified Audit firms to conduct the exercise. Please be guided by the quoted provisions and accept the assurance of my warm regards.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that Amaechi\u2019s desire to have HLS International Limited, an Israeli handling the $195 million maritime security contract, take over the disputed Secure Anchorage Area (SAA) that was turned down was another bone of contention.\n\nThe federal government had in 2017 approved a $195 million maritime security contract with an Israeli firm, HLS International Limited under the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure also called the Deep Blue Project.\n\nBut in a move that negates the anti-corruption posture of the Buhari administration, Amaechi wrote to the government to ask for another $22.99 million to hire fast intervention vessels to check insecurity in Nigeria\u2019s waters.\n\nIn a memo to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) dated July 22, 2020, Amaechi sought the government\u2019s approval for the renewal of lease of fast intervention security vessels for a period of one year, claiming the $195 million already approved for the same purpose had been put on hold due to COVID-19.\n\nThe memo reads in part, \u201cThe purpose of this memorandum is to seek the consideration of the FEC for the extension of the contract for the lease of 6 no. units of fast intervention security vessels (FISV) on the same terms and conditions as earlier approved by the FEC in 2018 in favour of the following 6 no. service provider: Pearl HPW Limited, Thamson Energy services Limited, Fairway Offshore Limited, Aquashiled Oil & Marine Services Limited, XPO Marine Services Limited and Peace Marine and Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cCouncil is invited to recall that at its EC(2018)40 meeting held on Wednesday, 5 December 2018, it considered and granted approval for the renewal of the contract for the lease of six fast intervention security vessels for a period of one year, at the reviewed daily rate of $10,500 per vessel-making a total sum of $22.995, 000.00 on an annual basis which is equivalent to N7,013,475, 000.00, at the exchange rate of $1.00 to N305.00, inclusive of all taxes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abdulsalami debunks alleged link with terrorists\n\nBy Francis Sardauna in Katsina and Dipo Laleye in Minna\n\nThere was outrage among residents of Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State yesterday as bandits abducted 45 worshippers observing the midnight prayer for Ramadan at Angwan Kwata Mosque in the area.\n\nThe marauding bandits, according to residents, stormed the mosque at 1 am and whisked away the victims to an unknown destination.\n\nBut the police said they had rescued 35 of the victims while 10 were still with the bandits.\n\nThe incidence occurred as a former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, debunked alleged link with terrorists and bandits.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Angwan Kwata yesterday, it was gathered that the bandits, during the raid on the mosque, directed the Imam to end the prayer session before kidnapping the people.\n\nHowever, residents slammed security agencies and the state government, saying the abduction of the congregants raised questions about the capacity of the government and security agents to tackle banditry and other forms of insecurity.\n\nThe residents, in separate interviews with THISDAY, accused the security agencies of culpability in the unending banditry and kidnapping in the area, saying security agencies don\u2019t respond to distress calls.\n\nA community leader in the area, who craved anonymity, said: \u201cThe bandits abducted 45 worshippers and injured many others. Some of the victims are in Jibia General Hospital now receiving treatment.\u201d\n\nHe accused the state government and security agencies of failing to secure the lives and property of the people.\n\nZaharadeen Umar, whose younger sister, Halimatu, was among those kidnapped, told THISDAY that the bandits kidnapped no fewer than 45 worshippers and injured two others who were trying to escape.\n\nUmar said: \u201cThis morning (Monday) at 1 am, we were praying inside the mosque when bandits came and started shouting that \u2018every everybody should stand, whoever runs will be killed.\u2019 I saw a young boy that is not up to my younger brother\u2019s age with AK-47.\n\n\u201cThey kidnapped our brothers, wives, and younger ones, including my 20-year-old younger sister, Halimatu. From our findings, the bandits kidnapped 45 people in the mosque. None of the security personnel came to our rescue during the attack till after one hour before they came.\u201d\n\nHe debunked the police report that they rescued some of the kidnapped victims, saying all the victims are still in captivity.\n\nHe, however, said efforts were being made by some residents in synergy with a vigilante group to rescue the abductees.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe police did not come to this place until 2 am when all the bandits had left with our people. When they came, they entered the mosque and packed the shoes of those kidnapped, and took them to their office. So, they did not even rescue a chicken from this place.\u201d\n\nAnother worshipper, who survived the attack but sustained injuries on his head and left hand, Muhammadu Bello, said the bandits operated for more than two hours.\n\nHe, however, could not ascertain the number of kidnapped victims because he fled the scene.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe bandits met us in the mosque and asked us to follow them but I told them I will not follow them. So, one of them hit me with his gun on my head. One of them also injured me with something on my left hand; so, I started running to town.\u201d\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the abduction of the 45 worshippers in a telephone interview with THISDAY.\n\nBut he said the police, in synergy with other security agencies, had rescued 35 of them.\n\nAccording to him, efforts are being made to rescue the remaining victims.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, there was an attack on a Jibia mosque this morning (Monday) and 45 worshippers were kidnapped, but we have rescued 35 of the kidnapped victims. Efforts are also on to rescue the remaining people.\u201d\n\nAbdulsalami Debunks Alleged Link with Terrorists, Bandits\n\nMeanwhile, a former Head of State, Gen. Abubakar Abdulsalami, has denied any link with any terrorist or bandit group.\n\nAbubakar, in a statement made available yesterday to journalists in Minna, Niger State, by his media aide, Dr. Yakubu Sulaiman, described\n\nthe claim of his having such link as: \u201cfalse unfounded and fake news.\u201d\n\nHis clarification came against the backdrop of a report on the alleged arrest of a helicopter allegedly belonging to him for supplying food and weapons to terrorists and bandits in parts of the country.\n\nAbdulsalami said he did not own such a helicopter.\n\nHe disassociated himself from what he described as such \u201ca heinous crime that is unbecoming of any patriotic citizen,\u201d saying he would have ignored such spurious reports but had to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cThis kind of fake news has the potential of aggravating the already tensed security situation in the country and should not be condoned,\u201d he said.\n\nHe regretted that individuals could be so \u201ccallous to peddle such news and smear the image and character of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerians to ignore such treacherous acts and be careful with the kind of information being dished out and shared on the social media,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to continue to work and pray for enduring peace in Nigeria, stressing that no nation can attain greatness without peace and security of lives and property of its citizens.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Insubordination may be one of the reasons that led to the suspension of the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nShocking details have emerged as to how Bala-Usman persistently refused to follow directives from President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn the case involving the lease of land in Tarkwa Bay granted to Global Resources Management Limited (GRML), owners of Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Limited (LADOL), which she unilaterally cancelled and re-allocated to Samsung Heavy Industries Limited, even when the President had directed that the lease be restored.\n\nThe directive was formally conveyed to her by both the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), but she adamantly refused to comply, different sources told SaharaReporters.\n\nIn 2020, the suspended Managing Director of NPA repeatedly turned down directive from President Buhari to restore the approval of the 25 year lease agreement for about 114,552 hectares of land granted to Messers Global Resources Management Limited (GRML) in 2003.\n\nThe land was proposed to house an industrial hub including a shipyard in an effort towards local content development to domesticate some of the projects sourced from outside the country.\n\nThings were going well with the construction of infrastructure including accommodation, storage facilities, and power generation on the site until November 14, 2019 when the NPA, under the directives of Bala Usman cancelled the lease alleging that the company contravened the terms of the agreement for the lease.\n\nWhatsApp Image 2021-05-11 at 17.15.1.pdf REVEALED: How Suspended Nigerian Ports Authority MD, Bala Usman Disobeyed Buhari\u2019s Directive, Cancelled 25-year Lease To Favour Samsung\n\nThe letter dated 14th November, 2019 which was signed by NPA\u2019s General Manager in charge of Land and Asset Administration, Yusuf Ahmed, conveyed the cancellation of the lease.\n\nHowever after extensive review, President Buhari reversed the cancellation through a Presidential directive dated 27th of May, 2020 with Ref No.PRES/97/HAGF/93, directing the NPA to comply by restoring the lease.\n\nAGF Malami conveyed the directive in a letter dated 3rd June, 2020 titled Re: Brief on LADOL Free Zone Disputes and the Need for Federal Government to Intervene Urgently. A legal opinion was attached.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the suspended MD never obeyed the directive.\n\nIt was learnt that it was the same Bala Usman who conveyed the approval of the President for extension of the lease in a letter dated 13th December, 2018 and exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nStakeholders were therefore taken aback when she turned around and cancelled the same lease after some months. Scandal EXCLUSIVE: How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman Awarded Coastline Terminals To Dangote's Proxy Company In Shady Deal\n\nMany observers raised concerns when the news broke because the LADOL project was considered a success story of indigenous investment and local capacity development within the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cThe site in question was originally a disused swamp before it was leased to the firm led by Chief Oladapo Jadesimi\n\n\u201cFor over 19 years, the swamp has been gradually transformed into a wholly developed terminal and industrial zone now known as LADOL Free Zone, a one-stop shop for multinational and industrial companies operating in West Africa.\n\n\u201cIt was commissioned by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on the 10th of August, 2018 in an event hosted by the Managing Director of NPA. At the event, Bala Usman herself praised the operational efficiency and synergy between NPA and LADOL that culminated in the successful berthing of Egina FPSO. During the same event, the Managing Director of Shell confirmed that his company had already gained 40% cost savings from working with LADOL.\n\n\u201cAmong other benefits, the lease was yielding a minimum of about N419 million per annum on rent alone to the government, including other taxes.\n\n\u201cHowever, after the swampy land was reclaimed and developed LADOL Free zone, the NPA cancelled the lease citing reasons that have not yet been substantiated logically.\n\n\u201cFor instance the claim by NPA under Hadiza\u2019s leadership that the sublease was done without their knowledge in a manner that will short-change the country was later found to be false.\n\n\u201cActually, it was discovered that GRML had applied to NPA via a letter dated November 22, 2013, expressing its intention to sublease 11.246 hectares at the LADOL offshore facility.\n\n\u201cIronically, after the cancellation the NPA\u2019s purported lease to Samsung Heavy Industries Limited was at the same terms as the subsisting lease to LADOL yet it was supposed to yield an income of N230.3 million almost half of what LADOL was paying as rent for the same land area. News How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman, Lambasted Buhari\u2019s Government Over Niger, Zamfara Students' Abductions\n\n\u201cWith the backing of NPA and based on the fictitious and unjustified pretext of investor protection to a foreign company who apparently has not invested a dime in the economy but who has allegedly repatriated over $2 billion in the five years of doing contracts in Nigeria, it was clear that Bala Usman wanted to hand over a strategic asset belonging to the country, especially the legacy of the multi-billion dollar investment made into the Egina field development as a gift to Samsung.\n\n\u201cAs the controversy was raging, Samsung capitalised on the delay orchestrated by NPA and proceeded to court. The consequent disagreement sent mixed signals to many partners who stalled their transactions till the conclusion of the ongoing litigations including arbitration in London.\n\n\u201cThe question stakeholders are asking is the value that NPA will create for the country by cancelling a contract already awarded to an indigenous company and re-awarding it on the same terms and lower returns to a foreign company,\u201d a source at the NPA told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother source in Presidency expressed shock at how a public officer will flout directives from the President and allow herself to become an instrument for economic sabotage.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a prominent maritime stakeholder said Bala Usman's actions have led to destruction of investors\u2019 confidence and huge capital flight\n\n\u201cThe lady took many of such actions and we did not know she was not going through the necessary due process. We have now learnt that many of the arbitrariness and insubordination that characterised her tenure did not receive the blessing of either the Minister of Transportation or the President. The fear is that such actions have led to so much destruction of investor confidence and huge capital flight,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\nOther stakeholders complained that Usman's approach to issues led to several litigation against the NPA which had frustrated contractual agreements that preceded her appointment, making the government incur avoidable losses amounting to millions of dollars in the last five years.\n\nThe claimed her numerous defiant actions might have contributed to the sudden and sharp drop in the income of the NPA at a time when the economy is in dire need of revenue, which might have angered the President.",

Scandal EXCLUSIVE: How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman Awarded Coastline Terminals To Dangote's Proxy Company In Shady Deal\n\nMany observers raised concerns when the news broke because the LADOL project was considered a success story of indigenous investment and local capacity development within the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cThe site in question was originally a disused swamp before it was leased to the firm led by Chief Oladapo Jadesimi\n\n\u201cFor over 19 years, the swamp has been gradually transformed into a wholly developed terminal and industrial zone now known as LADOL Free Zone, a one-stop shop for multinational and industrial companies operating in West Africa.\n\n\u201cIt was commissioned by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on the 10th of August, 2018 in an event hosted by the Managing Director of NPA. At the event, Bala Usman herself praised the operational efficiency and synergy between NPA and LADOL that culminated in the successful berthing of Egina FPSO. During the same event, the Managing Director of Shell confirmed that his company had already gained 40% cost savings from working with LADOL.\n\n\u201cAmong other benefits, the lease was yielding a minimum of about N419 million per annum on rent alone to the government, including other taxes.\n\n\u201cHowever, after the swampy land was reclaimed and developed LADOL Free zone, the NPA cancelled the lease citing reasons that have not yet been substantiated logically.\n\n\u201cFor instance the claim by NPA under Hadiza\u2019s leadership that the sublease was done without their knowledge in a manner that will short-change the country was later found to be false.\n\n\u201cActually, it was discovered that GRML had applied to NPA via a letter dated November 22, 2013, expressing its intention to sublease 11.246 hectares at the LADOL offshore facility.\n\n\u201cIronically, after the cancellation the NPA\u2019s purported lease to Samsung Heavy Industries Limited was at the same terms as the subsisting lease to LADOL yet it was supposed to yield an income of N230.3 million almost half of what LADOL was paying as rent for the same land area. News How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman, Lambasted Buhari\u2019s Government Over Niger, Zamfara Students' Abductions\n\n\u201cWith the backing of NPA and based on the fictitious and unjustified pretext of investor protection to a foreign company who apparently has not invested a dime in the economy but who has allegedly repatriated over $2 billion in the five years of doing contracts in Nigeria, it was clear that Bala Usman wanted to hand over a strategic asset belonging to the country, especially the legacy of the multi-billion dollar investment made into the Egina field development as a gift to Samsung.\n\n\u201cAs the controversy was raging, Samsung capitalised on the delay orchestrated by NPA and proceeded to court. The consequent disagreement sent mixed signals to many partners who stalled their transactions till the conclusion of the ongoing litigations including arbitration in London.\n\n\u201cThe question stakeholders are asking is the value that NPA will create for the country by cancelling a contract already awarded to an indigenous company and re-awarding it on the same terms and lower returns to a foreign company,\u201d a source at the NPA told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother source in Presidency expressed shock at how a public officer will flout directives from the President and allow herself to become an instrument for economic sabotage.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a prominent maritime stakeholder said Bala Usman's actions have led to destruction of investors\u2019 confidence and huge capital flight\n\n\u201cThe lady took many of such actions and we did not know she was not going through the necessary due process. We have now learnt that many of the arbitrariness and insubordination that characterised her tenure did not receive the blessing of either the Minister of Transportation or the President. The fear is that such actions have led to so much destruction of investor confidence and huge capital flight,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\nOther stakeholders complained that Usman's approach to issues led to several litigation against the NPA which had frustrated contractual agreements that preceded her appointment, making the government incur avoidable losses amounting to millions of dollars in the last five years.\n\nThe claimed her numerous defiant actions might have contributed to the sudden and sharp drop in the income of the NPA at a time when the economy is in dire need of revenue, which might have angered the President.",

          "text": "The governors of 17 southern states held a meeting in Asaba, Delta state, on Tuesday on the state of the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong their key demands are that President Muhammadu Buhari should be fairer in political appointments, convoke a national dialogue, accept the establishment of state police,\n\nBelow is the full text of the communique.\n\nAt its meeting held today, 11th May, 2021, the Southern Governors Forum reviewed the situation in the nation generally and focused on the current security situation, agitations/restructuring, prospect for inter-state collaboration and partnerships as well as on the incidence of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Rising from the meeting, the Forum:\n\nAdvertisement\n\naffirmed that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity;\n\nobserved that the incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security. Consequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria;\n\nnoted that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South. Given this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South (including cattle movement to the South by foot);\n\nrecommended that the Federal Government should support WILLING States to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems;\n\nagreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism;\n\nrecommended that in view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency;\n\nrecommended that in deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government Agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogenous;\n\nresolved to foster cooperation among the Southern States and the nation at large;\n\nexpressed concern on the continued gridlock on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway and the chokehold it has exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.

Jones\u2019 and Jim Lewis\u2019 \u2018Original FELA!\u2019 script. The production is to highlight the struggles of Fela, framing the #EndSARS movement in the context of his legacy.\n\nWhile the adaptation is a nod to the original Broadway musical, \u2018Ten Twenty\u2019 represents the date of the shooting of the protesters by security forces at the Lekki toll gate in October 2020 amid the anti-police brutality movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenting on the development, Nnaji said: \u201cThe contemporary issues highlighted are what sold me. This is an artful retelling of Fela\u2019s story and I\u2019m honored to be a part of it. I grew up on radio plays.\n\n\u201cAnd the experience is nostalgic for me \u2013 the power of voice to influence minds and touch hearts is undeniable.\u201d\n\nFuna Maduka, \u2018Fela Ten Twenty\u2019 writer, director-cum-producer, also said: \u201cI tripled speaking roles for women by bringing the voices of the Kalakuta Queens, women who fought and performed alongside Fela, to the forefront.\n\n\u201cWomen have long been at the center of political movements, especially in Africa. To have a woman of Genevieve\u2019s caliber play a Kalakuta Queen, only elevates this legacy of leadership, fortitude, and grace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "title": "Despite $33 million Q1 revenue, Jumia\u2019s share price may take another nosedive after recent results",
          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "text": "Almost a month after Uber and Bolt drivers under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA) umbrella held a strike in Lagos, Uber has raised its prices. At the time of the strike in April, the President of PEPDA, Idris Shonuga, said one of the reasons the drivers were striking was the pricing of the rides.\n\nHe argued that the fare prices had become so low it was difficult for drivers to make ends meet and likened driving for cab-hailing services to a type of systemic poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a complaint that we\u2019re hearing from ride-hailing drivers worldwide. In March 2021, drivers made landmark progress after winning a lawsuit forcing Uber to classify them as workers instead of independent contractors.\n\nThat distinction is essential because classifying drivers as independent workers allows Uber and Bolt to avoid paying insurance, paid leave, and other benefits.\n\nThe victory of Uber drivers in London has led to a global push for a similar reclassification with drivers in South Africa and Nigeria planning class-action lawsuits against Uber and Bolt. For now, Uber drivers will take the small victory of raised prices.\n\nIn a statement to driver-partners, Uber said, \u201cWe remain committed to providing a reliable earning opportunity for driver-partners, as well as a reliable and affordable service for riders. With this in mind, starting 11th May 2021, we are increasing prices on UberX by about 13%.\u201d\n\nBetween 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Mondays, and 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Tuesdays through Friday, Uber riders will now pay a base fare of N237, minimum fare of N538; N70 per kilometre and N12 per minute. These fares are up from the previous minimum fare of N500, N200 base fare, N50 per kilometre and N11 per minute.\n\nAt other periods, riders will be charged a minimum fare of N575; a base fare of N255, N75 per kilometre and N12.5 per minute.\n\nThere are reports that the drivers are unimpressed with the changes seeing as one of their demands was that Uber reduce its commission from 25% and give them a say in deciding the fees.\n\nThe President of PEPDA wasn\u2019t available to speak on the phone at the time of this report.",

          "title": "Maviance raises $3m from MFS Africa to digitize financial services across Central Africa",
          "text": "Maviance, a Cameroon-based company providing digital financial services like agency banking and bulk bill payments, has raised $3 million (\u20ac2.5 million) in equity financing.\n\nThe investment is solely from MFS Africa, the cross-border fintech company connecting mobile money providers like MTN to banks like Ecobank across over 34 countries in Africa.\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s investment gives it an undisclosed minority stake in Maviance.\n\nMaviance\u2019s flagship product is Smobilpay, a platform that integrates payments solutions from banks, mobile money operators and telecoms operators. Smobilpay is connected to GIMAC, the interoperability switch of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) \u2013 the central bank of the Central African region.\n\nBecause it is a business-to-business company, Smobilpay may not be familiar with consumers. But the platform serves over 500,000 unique customers a month, according to the company.\n\nJerry Cheambe, Maviance founder, believes the pandemic has helped increase business owners\u2019 appetite for digitising payments. Cameroon is a country of 26.88 million people. Mobile connections increased by 11% to 26.6 million between January 2020 and January 2021 while internet penetration is at 34%.\n\nWith this seed funding, Maviance will expand Smobilpay\u2019s national footprint in Cameroon to serve more consumers and to move into Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Maviance will be building new products but they won\u2019t go to market within the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cOur journey now is to become a regional company, providing cross-border services within the CEMAC region. We want to be a catalyst for interoperability,\u201d Cheambe says.\n\nHe adds that Maviance chose to go with MFS Africa because they bring money, industry knowledge, a product suite and a pan-African network of fintechs and businesses of various sizes to the table. The deal took over a year, from contact to close.\n\nThe appeal for both companies is to collaborate on building digital financial services in the Central African economic region\u2019s 6 countries: Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nMaviance was founded in Germany in 2008 by Jerry Cheambe and Michael Flach. They launched Maviance Cameroon in 2012, at a time when mobile money looked unlikely in the country.\n\n\u201cI remember saying at one point that mobile money will not work in Cameroon because it was just not happening,\u201d Cheambe says to TechCabal.\n\nTen years later, the landscape has improved enough for Maviance to be raising a large seed round.\n\n95% of Maviance Cameroon\u2019s 20-person staff are based in Cameroon. Cheambe is based in Germany where he oversees Maviance Germany, which operates independently of the Cameroonian venture.\n\nAnother strategic move by MFS Africa\n\nMFS Africa has been on a roll of deals over the last 12 months.\n\nIn June 2020, the South Africa-based company acquired Beyonic, a Tanzania-based payments company, in a cash and shares deal that paid out at least 4x returns for Beyonic\u2019s investors. Last month, MFS Africa led a $2.3 million seed round in Numida, a credit provider for small businesses in Uganda.\n\nWith Maviance in the mix, MFS Africa continues a conscious push to be Africa\u2019s largest hub for digital financial services.\n\nAs with the Beyonic deal, the Maviance team was in the process of raising money when MFS Africa approached.\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, says Maviance has been on MFS Africa\u2019s radar for some time. What convinced him to initiate investment conversations with Cheambe?\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of the asset \u2013 what they have built on the ground \u2013 the ability to work with them and the shared vision of the founder,\u201d Okoudjou says to TechCabal.\n\nMFS Africa was already present in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, working with mobile networks MTN and Airtel. But MFS Africa can rely on Maviance to cover the region and carry out integrations much faster.\n\nThough MFS Africa had scanned the market for other possible partners, the Maviance team had a long-term focus on building solid foundations. It is a minority investment but \u201cobviously both Jerry and I know that there is a possible path forward together,\u201d Okoudjou says.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s foremost fintech company, Global Accelerex (\u201cAccelerex\u201d), is creating exciting job opportunities for young and innovative Nigerians with a strong bias for technology, through its Accelerex Tech Open House. The first edition of the event held recently at Radisson Hotel, Ikeja, with the finest set of creative and brilliant software engineers and tech innovators in attendance.\n\nThe young, vibrant and smart-looking techies took turns to chat with the company\u2019s in-house assessors. This was followed by intense conversations and demos, as each of the participants displayed novel approaches to software design and development.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s objective for organizing the event, Executive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters, stressed that Accelerex\u2019s most valuable asset is its human resource. Therefore, it places the highest premium on attracting the best talents across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a Company, we know that there are Nigerian software engineers that can rival their counterparts around the globe, as recent developments in the fintech space have shown. A critical part of our effort to strengthen the digital economy is the creation of this platform where outstanding individuals can showcase their skills and can join the Technology Team at Accelerex. We believe that the next big names in the technology space will come out of Africa, and we are providing the breeding ground for them,\u201d Mr. Peters stated.\n\nExecutive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters\n\n\n\nThe Head, Human Resources, Mr. Rowland Ogbonda, pointed out that the company is expanding the frontiers and setting a new benchmark in the Nigerian fintech space by giving unrivalled opportunities to highly skilled tech talents with non-traditional education to join its workforce and become part of a team that is solving real-life problems for its target markets.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are many talented innovators and software engineers with disruptive ideas that they are eager to unleash. Therefore, we have scrapped the university degree requirement, and are prioritizing technical depth and capabilities above years of experience for tech candidates, even as we try to champion inclusion in our recruitment process. With our culture of continuous learning, improvement and upskilling, successful attendees would certainly realise their full potential with us\u201d, Mr. Ogbonda added.\n\nFurther buttressing this position, Head, Enterprise Technology Solutions, Mr. Lanre Afodunrinbi, disclosed that the company\u2019s expansion to other parts of Africa made it necessary to beef up the Technology Team to continually deliver superior solutions to its different markets.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the youths and are giving them an opportunity to expand their knowledge and capabilities by selecting the smartest among them to leverage our African expansion and other growth initiatives. This will expose, challenge and motivate them to seek far-reaching solutions to perennial payment problems. Through this, we are also contributing to the economy and reducing the unemployment figures in Nigeria. Initiatives like our open house will go a long way towards curbing brain drain, as young and tech-savvy Nigerians will no longer jump on the next flight in search of greener pastures, when they can have the same opportunities here\u201d, Mr. Afodunrinbi concluded.\n\nAt the end of the session, participants were given a dose of Accelerex\u2019s hospitality, and were treated to upscale dining, gift packs and a free ride to and from the venue. The event gave prospective talents an immersive experience of the Accelerex culture in a warm, relaxed and engaging environment, which made the company an attractive career choice for them.\n\nAccelerex is renowned for its pedigree in innovation, world-class technology, excellent customer service and a commitment to provide fintech solutions that evolve with customers\u2019 needs across Africa. The company has set itself apart as a great place to work with a meaningful set of values that have defined its culture and helped cultivate an environment that embraces diversity and promotes ingenuity.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew Episode!

Justice Esther Edigin for her contribution to the peace and development of the state, pledging that his government will sustain ongoing reforms in the judiciary.\n\nObaseki made the pledge when he received Justice Edigin who was on a valedictory visit to the governor at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nEdigin, who will be retiring on Monday, May 17, 2021, was sworn-in as the seventh substantive Chief Judge of Edo State on Friday, November 22, 2019, following the retirement of Hon. Justice Esohe Ikponmwen from the state\u2019s public service.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cWe have been very consistent, as a government, about the judiciary. The Judiciary is the anchor on which our democracy rests and as such must be treated and given its due place in our democracy.\n\n\u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to cover more grounds as desired in terms of judiciary transformation in Edo State. The Executive is currently going through that process as we have reforms to show; the legislature is also pushing for a very hard transformation and it will be our joy carrying the judiciary joins in this trend to ensure the transformation and modernization of the judiciary system.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki said his administration will continue to cooperate and work with the judiciary to make it more effective and efficient in discharging its responsibilities.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are dealing with a new world and nobody expected it as we were caught napping. Various institutions and states rely solely on one major source of resources. This is not good for us; it should be about our collective survival and not individual survival; we either sail or sink together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make Edo State the judiciary hub of this zone. As a government, we want to thank you for your services to Edo State. We will continue to reform the Judiciary system,\u201d he reassured.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Judge commended Governor Obaseki for the cordial relationship and cooperation with the Judiciary.\n\nShe said: \u201cl am here today to pay you a valedictory visit as part of events marking my disengagement from the Judiciary and Government of Edo State.\n\n\u201cI will be retiring next week, Monday, May 17, 2021. I want to thank the Edo State Government for the cooperation with the Judiciary. The government facilitated the construction and handover of 12 modern Courts to the Judiciary.

Sahara Reporters of May 8 elaborated on the new secret plan, which, by the grace of God, has come to the public domain. The report further revealed that the exercise would commence from Orlu in Imo State. This is very disturbing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of deployment of northern military officers to the South East lends credence to the above report. Sahara Reporters revealed that in preparation for the above, the Nigerian army has posted Northern Muslims as commanders over its operations and brigades in Anambra, Imo, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Benue, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra, the Cantonment Commandant of the 302 Artillery Regiment, Onitsha is Col. Abdulsalam Sambo, a northern Muslim; in Imo, the Commander of 34 Brigade, Obinze, is Brig-Gen. Ibrahim Tukura, another northerner; in Abia, the Commander of 14 Brigade, Ohafia, is Brig-Gen M. Ibrahim, a northerner; while in Akwa Ibom, the Commander of 2 Brigade, Uyo, is Brig-Gen. Faruk Mijinyawa, another northerner. This is truly worrisome!\u201d\n\nPresident-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Professor George Obiozor, had admonished the Nigerian government to learn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism, but seek possible peaceful options that guarantee national unity and peaceful coexistence.\n\nObiozor, according to the group, lamented: \u201cSubnational consciousness or ethnocentric nationalism, which is a dangerous form of nationalism to national unity has taken over Nigeria. The dream of Nigeria\u2019s unity is receding fast with violence, crises and conflicts.\u201d\n\nOgbonnia stated that Ndigbo were unequivocal that the current problems confronting Nigeria were a product of sustained orchestrated injustice in governance.\n\nOhanaeze urged the Federal Government to refrain from the use of force in resolving the present national crises.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that military and violent means to solve the national question is bound to fail, as it leads to further national fractionalisation, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration, as in all empires or multi-national states or countries,\u201d it added.",

          "text": "By Tunde Oguntola, Abuja\n\nThe federal government has said that there are no new restrictions over COVID-19, rather it reviewed the country\u2019s response in light of the rising trend in several countries and the high risk of a surge in cases in Africa.\n\nRecall that on May 4, 2021, the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 took a precautionary step by restricting travel to Nigeria from three countries \u2013 Brazil, India and Turkey \u2013 where there is a high incidence of cases, high fatality rate and widespread prevalence of variants of concern.\n\nAdditionally, the PSC continued to reinforce the surveillance system at the country\u2019s points of entry.\n\nThe minister of information and culture, Alh. Lai Mohammed, who clarified the stance of the PSC during a meeting with online newspaper publishers in Lagos on Tuesday, said the committee only reintroduced some restrictions on movement and social interactions in the phase four of restrictions.\n\nMohammed said even when the government earlier eased the restrictions on COVID-19, the curfew between 12am and 4 am was still in place.\n\nHe, however, decried the situation where some Nigerians are behaving as if COVID-19 has gone and gone forever.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBut Nigerians are behaving as if COVID-19 has gone and gone forever, this is the mistake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIndia thought they conquered COVID-19 and political campaigns started, festivals started and to compound matters for them, the new variants of COVID appeared. They are now having 400,000 cases per day and 3,000 to 4,000 deaths daily.\n\n\u201cThere are no new restrictions on COVID-19. The PSC was only reported out of context. The PSC on COVID-19 only introduced the fourth phase of ease of restriction and what we did was reviving the extant regulations on ground.\n\n\u201cEven when we eased the restrictions, the curfew between 12am and 4am is still on,\u201d the minister stressed.\n\nHe noted that every three months, PSC reviews the country\u2019s response to COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cEvery three months PSC do review where we are and where we are going and the only new thing we introduced is travel restraint. If you are coming from Brazil, Turkey, and India as a Nigerian you must go for compulsory quarantine.\n\n\u201cNothing has changed, we have not opened nightclubs or gyms. The regulation on the use of face masks and social distancing is still in place. But nobody obeys it.\u201d\n\nHe said that Nigerians have been very fortunate even amidst the fact that Nigerians are indifferent about using a face mask.\n\n\u201cWe we don\u2019t have health infrastructure to handle 3,000 cases a day. How many bed spaces do we have in Lagos?\u201d he asked, adding that if it is the recklessness and abandonment, the nation would have lost more lives.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 protocol is still in place but people have resumed \u2018owambe\u2019 parties now. Political rallies and so on which is a \u2018super spreader\u2019 for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s are no new restrictions you can still travel by roads or by air. Please ensure you put on your face mask. If you have a party make sure it is less than 50 people. This is just what we have reiterated no new restrictions at all,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED: As 4th Wave Concerns Rise",

          "text": "By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah\n\nIn view of the rising insecurity in the South-East and South-South regions, President Muhammadu Buhari has approved new security measures for the two geopolitical zones.\n\nThe acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba; alongside the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (retd), and Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the security meeting presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa on Tuesday.\n\nThe council also took a decision not to publicise measures to be deployed to tackle insecurity in the country henceforth for a more effective result.\n\nThe council also agreed that the level of insecurity in the country, especially in the last one month must be reversed.\n\nAccording to the acting IGP, the Security Council meeting, which has taken place three times during the last 11 days assessed the situation in the country, particularly South-east and South-south, as it affects law and order.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have some measures that have been approved by the council to check insecurity. We have some measures which we have outlined and have been approved by the council and we\u2019ll see how we can change the narrative within the quickest possible time to restore law and order and restore peace in that area.\n\n\u201cWe solicit all law-abiding citizens to work with us to identify and deal with the situation. That is, I may not go into the details of how we will do that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor his part during the briefing, NSA Monguno said the meeting stressed the need to address the security challenges in the country particularly those that have arisen in the last few months.\n\nHe said President Buhari gave matching orders to deal with the emerging problems physically.\n\n\u201cThe first two meetings were inconclusive, but today\u2019s meeting is the final in the three meetings. Again, Mr. President\u2019s concern at the growing trend of insecurity has been highlighted and the meeting, basically, was briefed by the National Security Adviser, the Chief of Defense Staff and the Inspector-General Police.\n\n\u201cI briefed the meeting on strategic issues in relation to security, while the Chief of Defense Staff briefed on operational issues, and Inspector General of Police briefed on constabulary matters.\n\n\u201cOn my part, I briefed council on the enablers of crime and the need to find quick responses with a view to mitigating the growing threats to society.\n\n\u201cThese enablers are discussed in detail and Mr. President has already given direction on how to deal with them, specifically issues of drug abuse as propellants for crime, how to make the criminal justice system much more effective, as well as looking at issues of unemployment, which of course, the federal executive council had given an approval, through previous memos on how to get 100 million people out of poverty, that was also discussed. Then, again, the lack of an effective crime reporting system.\n\n\u201cAgain, the President has given direction on how to make these things effective. Already, the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) has been given certain instructions on how to deal with this, but by and by council has agreed that the level of insecurity in the country, especially in the last one month, is something that has to be addressed with the immediacy that it requires and at the operational level, of course, the Chief of Defense Staff has been working with the service chiefs and the recommendations they\u2019ve made to the council are already being handled,\u201d Monguno said.\n\nIrabor on his partsaid far-reaching decisions have been made that will boost the operations of the security agencies.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, far-reaching decisions were made. On our part, just as the National Security Adviser indicated, I briefed on various measures that the Armed Forces, in partnership with other security agencies, the measures we\u2019ve taken to stem the tide of insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe council was pleased with the actions and of course, the prayers that were made, which council has also graciously undertaken to look into.\n\n\u201cThese, of course, have to do with manpower development, training and equipment issues, and thankfully, the glow on my face should, of course, give you an indication as to the graciousness of the National Security Council, in relation to the briefings that we\u2019ve given in this regard and I believe that going forward, we shall be translating that and it will have some great impact on the security disposition across the country,\u201d Irabor added.\n\nRELATED: Southern Governors Meet In Delta Over Rising Insecurity",

          "title": "TRCN: Repositioning teaching from the shadows \u2014 Daily Times Nigeria",
          "text": "Achieving qualitative education in Nigeria would be a mirage if the teaching profession is not in good shape. In this report, DOOSUUR IWAMBE, examines how the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria is transforming the profession through innovation.\n\nIt is no longer news that most developed countries usually trace their roots of success in all sectors to the quality of their teaching profession.\n\nThe long chain of all other professions like medicine, law and engineering originate from the teaching profession. However, the reverse is the case in Nigeria, as teaching is being seen as the last resort for academic losers.\n\nSome people even refer to teachers as substitutes on the bench of life, who are left with no option than to proceed and be employed into the teaching profession.\n\nTeachers\u2019 condition of service in Nigeria lacks adequate incentives to attract and retain the best brains in Nigerian schools.\n\nThe dwindling attraction to the teaching profession, and by extension the resultant low enrollment in the teacher education programs are traceable to the relatively low social status of teachers with accompanying psychological impacts.\n\nConsequently, within the remaining pool, some teachers either seek opportunities in other sectors (within the economy) with better service incentives or even migrate to other countries where teachers\u2019 conditions of service are much better, in search of greener pastures.\n\nThe quality or standard of education in Nigeria has reduced in recent years because of, among other factors, the brain drain phenomenon, (i.e., the drift of many brilliant, intelligent and more experienced teachers and university lecturers to countries where they were offered better remunerations and conditions of service).\n\nThis, to a large extent, is attributable to inadequate incentives, poorly equipped education system in an increasingly hostile working environment, inadequate social recognition, delay in payment (and sometimes denial) of teachers\u2019 salaries, among others.\n\nThe reliance on inexperienced, and in some cases unqualified teachers in the various educational fields and institutions in the country definitely affects the quality of students\u2019 work, and of graduates who are eventually employed to service the educational workers\u2019 needs, as well as the economy.\n\nThis vicious circle contributes to the lowering status of education in the universities, colleges of education as well as secondary and primary schools even as the trend impacts on the economy negatively.\n\nTRCN innovations changing the narrative\n\nTo change the narrative and make the teaching profession attractive as w put it at par with global standards, the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) under the leadership of its Registrar, Professor Josiah Ajiboye, has embarked on some innovative measures that are silently transforming the profession.\n\nFor instance, the council set up a taskforce to crackdown on unqualified teachers across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nAjiboye explained that the enforcement and monitoring of compliance with its directive was to ensure that only qualified professionals licensed by TRCN should teach in public and private schools nationwide.\n\nAjiboye, who maintained that no serious country allows her future leaders to be miseducated by quacks, stated that the Buhari-led administration is determined to have professional teachers given necessary tools to excel.\n\n\u201cTRCN commences compliance monitoring across the country. As the December 31, 2019 deadline given by the National Council on Education for anybody who wants to practise as a teacher in the country to get qualified, registered and licensed by TRCN has passed, the regulatory authority is embarking on verification of compliance in all the states of the federation and FCT.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is, however, put on hold in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states due to the challenges there. The TRCN team in each State will be led by a Professor of Education or a Provost of a College of Education.\n\nThe first leg of the exercise will start on the 9th of March and end on the 17th.\n\n\u201cHowever this exercise will be a continuous one as TRCN has created a Compliance and Enforcement Unit at its head office for routine monitoring.\n\n\u201cPrior to the commencement of the monitoring, a technical team was set up by TRCN and a meeting was held with all the state coordinators, where issues of logistics were discussed and harmonised,\u201d the TRCN Registrar said.\n\nProf Ajiboye also took exception to state governments that have been recruiting teachers and treating TRCN certification or license as optional, as he reiterated that a TRCN certification is mandatory in order to be considered employable as a teacher.\n\n\u201cTRCN takes exception to some states making the TRCN Certificate optional in their recruitment of teachers.\n\nThis practice must stop because it is mandatory for anyone who wants to profit from the job of a teacher to be registered with the regulatory authority.\n\nIt is therefore considered absurd for any state to say \u2018TRCN Certificate will be an added advantage\u2019.\n\nWhereas that is supposed to be the number one criterion. This is the global best practice.\n\n\u201cThere is no serious nation that would allow just anybody into its classrooms to teach their children. There must be evidence of professional certification to practice as a teacher,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking recently during a one-day Capacity Training Workshop, it organized for Education Correspondents Association of Nigeria (ECAN) in Abuja, Prof Ajiboye disclosed that Nigerian Teachers are now being sought after globally.\n\nHe said that he has signed about 100 letters of Professional for qualified Nigerian teachers who secured teaching jobs in Canada and other parts of the world since the beginning of the year 2021.\n\nWhile stressing that teachers trained in Nigeria are becoming highly competitive, he added that governments at all levels should work hard to attract them to stay back home.\n\nAjiboye emphasized the approvals given by President Muhammadu Buhari, on repositioning teaching profession in the country.\n\nHe also called for adherence by the State governments as they are the largest employers of teachers in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr President started with that in 2020, if we can be able to follow through this, I believe very strongly that the trend of our teachers leaving the country will reduce.\n\n\u201cAt the Federal Ministry of Education level, the circular has gone out on 65years of teacher\u2019s retirement, Federal teachers will benefit from this beginning from January 2021, some of the approval will wait till 2022 but we will continue with the implementation\u201d.\n\nHe assured that with the approvals given by the President and with it full implementation across the country with the cooperation of states, more qualified teachers will be retained in the system.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our qualified teachers to leave Nigeria but for those that are leaving, they are being rated at par with their colleagues abroad\u201d.\n\nAjiboye, who further noted that it was getting practically impossible to get a teaching job without being registered and licensed, however, said that the country would only develop positively when the right calibre of teachers were engaged to impact learning in schools. \u201cIf we want to get it right in Nigeria, we must get the issues of the teachers\u2019 right.\n\n\u2018\u2019A situation where anyone whether qualified or unqualified is free to stand in front of a classroom to teach is sheet anarchy and Nigeria is already paying a big price for neglect of the sector.\u201d\n\nAjiboye said the next step on line was to secure the approval of the Federal Executive Council, adding that the National Assembly was also expected to intervene in amending relevant laws to allow the increase in service and retirement years for teachers.\n\nThe TRCN boss further commended Buhari; the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu; and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, for their support to the teaching profession.\n\nThe TRCN\u2019s Assistant Director, Research and Statistics, Dr. Magaji Waziri in his presentation at the workshop explained that the approved document on career path policy for teachers had also been approved by the National Council on Education, and already awaiting the buy-in by relevant stakeholders for implementation.\n\nHe also called on the federal government to make education course compulsory for all the universities in the country.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Chairman of ECAN, Chuks Ukwuatu, called on journalists to ensure adequate reportage of education to foster development in other sectors.\n\nUkwuatu commended TRCN for its role in ensuring excellence in the education, professionalism of teachers, as well a maintenance of teachers\u2019 quality.\n\nHe also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to renew the appointment of the TRCN boss to ensure continuity in transforming the nation\u2019s teaching profession.\n\nThe Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) is a statutory body established by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria Act 1993. The council is an agency under the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nThe TRCN Act declares that the purpose of the Act is to establish the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, which has the duty of determining the standards of knowledge and skill to be attained by persons seeking to become registered as teachers and for related matters.\n\nThe TRCN is a statutory regulatory body which regulates the teaching profession and teachers at all levels of the Nigerian Education system. A regulatory body is a statutory establishment charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with the requirement of the law.\n\nIt generally has the duties of accrediting, recognising and approving persons and organisations which fall under the purview of its control.",

A situation where security agencies seem overwhelmed such that foreigners take advantage of the situation to wreak havoc on the country is unacceptable to Nigerian women\u201d.\n\nThey, therefore called on government to convene a National Conference where Nigerians from all walks of life and the different sections can have the opportunity to ventilate their grievances (if any) or express their views on the situation of the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: Shehu Sani shares lesson as Boko Haram distributes food to Borno, Yobe residents\n\nThe Women Elders Council was of the opinion that the conference will also afford the government the opportunity to bring every section together towards a lasting solution to the myriads of problems confronting the nation.\n\nOn why another conference despite past conferences held in the country, the council said it will address peculiar issues not addressed by previous roundtables.\n\n\u201cYou may ask \u201canother conference?\u201d. And we say \u201cyes\u201d because there are fresh challenges that have come up in the last six years which the other conferences may not have envisaged and addressed.\n\n\u201cWe hereby put the Federal Government in notice that after two months of this call for a National Conference, if nothing is done, Nigerian Women Elders Council will commence a two week fasting and prayers to seek divine intervention and guidance for further action.\n\n\u201cAfter communing with God Almighty,we will lead Nigeria women on a nationwide peaceful protest.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, if government remains adamant, Nigerian Women Elders Council will lead Nigerians in a sit \u2013 at -home action until the Nigerian government and the political class convene a National Conference and agree on workable solutions to the numerous challenges bedeviling the country.\n\n*Nigerian Women Elders Council is tired of watching precious Nigerian lives being wasted on a daily basis as Nigeria as a nation reaches a tipping point and our children are used as pawns in the hands of power seekers.

But I have come to understand that there are four types of mothers.\n\n\u201cThe first type of mother is the mother that is only able to love her own children \u2013 to love, protect, provide just for her own children. She doesn\u2019t have the grace to love other children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second type of mother is the woman who craves so bad to have her own children but she can\u2019t due to one reason or the other.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s got so much love and compassion for children and so she decides to adopt other people\u2019s children or child and raise them and love them with all of her heart and soul and she doesn\u2019t see no difference in whether the child is her biological child or not.\n\n\u201cThird type of mother is the mother that doesn\u2019t even know how to love her own child. She\u2019s got no love for children, even though she is a mother, she doesn\u2019t know how to love that child because some times in some cases, she doesn\u2019t love herself and when you do not love yourself, it\u2019s very hard to love other people.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes it might just be that she doesn\u2019t just love children. And then we have this kind of mother who loves her children but also has the grace to love other children, She is passionate about children. It doesn\u2019t have to be just her children alone, as long as you\u2019re a child, she just has that special kind of love for you,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking further, Iyabo Ojo said she used to think the government is the problem of Nigerian but she has come to realise that Nigerians are one another\u2019s problem with the way they think and act selfishly.\n\nShe added when people eventually get in power, they would not attend to some things simply because it doesn\u2019t concern them but would rather want to take care of their people.\n\n\u201cThe day we begin to take up issues that don\u2019t concern us and treat them like our own problems, Nigeria will begin to get better,\u201d she stressed.\n\nThe actress stated that she is the fourth mother who loves her children and other children and will stand for the victim of Baba Ijesha\u2019s alleged molestation till the very end.\n\n\u201cSo my brothers, my sisters, my mummies and daddies, my uncles, my aunties, my cousins my nephew, I am that woman, that mother who will stand for that girl till the end.

By stabbing him with a knife, hitting his head with a gun and breaking his teeth, facts which it noted weren\u2019t denied by the respondents.\n\nIt also frowned at the failure of the Police authorities to charge the Petitioner for the alleged offence of receiving and selling stolen property at his shops at the Alaba international market. Lagos.\n\nAccording to justice Doris Okuwobi who read the panels decision, the police witness also affirmed during his evidence that torture is a usual technique used by it\u2019s officers during interrogations.\n\nAccordingly, the panel awarded N7.5mto Mr Ndukwe for the inhuman treatment meted out on him, and ordered that the Nigeria Police Force carries out an investigation to find the indicted officers and sanction them accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Petitioner and his mother weren\u2019t satisfied with the amount awarded, saying it was far below the expenses they have borne over the years on the injuries he sustained, which have drained their pockets and crippled his business\n\nHis lawyer, Olukoya Ogungbeje also told TVC news that justice has been served on the matter, though at the first instance, but that they would be taking the matter up further\n\nThe Lagos panel also awarded two more petitioners, Andrew Okoh and Isaac Adesina, three million naira each for the grievous bodily damage suffered in gunshots fired by now dismissed police corporal, Nelson Bassey in 2011.\n\nJustice Okuwobi noted that there was no evidence that the Nigeria Police Force gave both men any compensation for the unlawful acts.\n\nThe panel recommended that the police body sets up a protocol for the treatment of persons shot by police officers, and urged that police operatives undergo a minimum of two trainings every year on exercising restraints and observance of human rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the petition of the late Ikwechi Onwugbufor, no award of compensation was given to the family.
