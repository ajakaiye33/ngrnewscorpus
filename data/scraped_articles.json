          "summary": "Kindly Share This Story:Pakistan\u2019s Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said on Monday that the demand by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to hike the electricity tariff to release more funds could lead to further inflation in the country.\nTarin said this during a meeting of the National Assembly\u2019s sub-committee on finance, according to sources in the finance division.\nAccording to the minister, it is unfair to push Pakistan to increase its electricity tariff as it will only affect the country\u2019s economy negatively.\nWhile hinting at reviewing the programme with the IMF, the minister said Pakistan had assured the lender of reducing circular debt, but the demand for increasing electricity tariff is not understandable.\nPakistan has promised the IMF to increase taxes by 1.272 trillion rupees and raise electricity tariff by almost 5 rupees per unit, according to local media.",
