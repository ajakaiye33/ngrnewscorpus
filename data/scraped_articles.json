          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nOVER two thousand hectares of land with titled documents have been given by 24 States for the Federal Government\u2019s Social Housing programme, while 17 have indicated interest to participate in the Solar Power programme in the ongoing Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\nThis is as an agreement has been reached with one of the major cement manufacturers in the country to sell at significantly discounted prices as low as N2, 600 per bag of cement for the social housing projects.\n\nThe agreement was reached after a meeting Vice President Yemi Osinbajo held with three major cement manufacturers in the country, Dangote Cement, Bua Cement and Lafarge Cement manufacturers.\n\nA statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande stated that this was among some of the highlights from a review on the Economic Sustainability Plan implementation presided over by Prof Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, weekend.\n\nCommenting on the implementation of components of ESP, the Vice President said the government will continue to focus on creating more jobs while improving access to power and affordable housing for majority of Nigerians.\n\nProf. Osinbajo, who highlighted the progress made so far, assured that the Federal Government will ramp up efforts to so more Nigerians have access to electricity and affordable housing.\n\nAccording to the presentation made by the Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Alhaji Ahmad Salihijo, the Solar Power Naija team has had engagements with the six states who have identified private sector developers.\n\nThe team has also selected Akwa Ibom, Ekiti and Kano as pilot states for the state-guaranteed transaction model for the solar power programme.\n\nHe explained that REA is currently tracking transactions worth N55 billion potentially contributing the first two million connections in Nigeria and providing thousands of jobs.\n\nFor instance, the programme is currently tracking four transactions in the commercial bank upstream channel contributing 3,500 jobs and 100,000 connections.\n\nThe MD further stated that nine participants have submitted applications for over N4 billion of the N20 billion allocated with three companies close to receiving disbursements.\n\nHe said, \u201cBleu Camel Energy with a loan amount of N3 billion is targeting to create 600 jobs; Sunking, another investor with a loan amount of N3 billion will create 1,500 jobs; Auxno Solar with N300 million loan amount targets 100 jobs while Emerald Industrial Co. is seeking N3 billion funding to manufacture 100,000 Solar Home Systems and smart meters.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand but in the same vein, the Managing Director/CEO of the Family Homes Fund Limited (FHFL) \u2013 the implementing agency for the Social Housing scheme, Mr. Femi Adewole, stated that 17,584 units across 16 locations are now on the pipeline.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are having a successful push in assembling land to feed the housing construction. So far about 2156.4ha have been assembled ready for development. This has the capacity to accommodate about 65,000 homes.\u201d\n\nAdewole explained that under the ESP Social Housing programme, Nigerians would be given at least a 15-year period with a monthly payment at six percent interest rate to pay for each housing unit.\n\nWhile the rates are significantly low, the MD noted that this period can also be extended through refinancing.\n\n\u201cThis will help to improve access to housing for low-income people in the informal sector who-(otherwise) will not have an opportunity to access a mortgage,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further said that in addition to the typical 2, 3, and 4-bedroom housing units, the FHFL was considering a \u201cStudents and Young People\u2019s Housing \u2013 to address the needs of young people.\u201d\n\nAn agreement with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has now been finalized and signed by Family Homes Funds, he disclosed while drawdown is subject to a guarantee from the Ministry of Finance.\n\nIt would be recalled that the CBN had committed to a N200B facility with a guarantee by the FG via the Finance Ministry for the Social Housing scheme.\n\nSpeaking further, the FHFL MD noted the agency has struck partnerships with Dangote Cement for the provision of cement at subsidized rates to construct the ESP homes, adding that \u201cwe expect to reach a similar agreement with the other two majors shortly.\u201d\n\nHe added that the FHFL has signed an MoU with the ESP Solar Power project including 3 suppliers to provide low-cost solar panels to the homes.\n\nAdewole stated that the delivery of the units would be through SME Delivery Partners \u2013 who are being encouraged to register on the Housing Portal.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo far about 7,333 SME groups and individuals are registered on the online portal. Up to 2,000 of these will be involved in current projects.\n\n\u201cWe will be drawing from ongoing experience on our project in Yola where the construction of 3,600 homes are ongoing and a partnership between FHFL and the Ministry of Housing is implementing a large-scale youth employment scheme currently employing 1350 young people. The young people are manufacturing interlocking tiles, paving, screeding, etc.\n\nFor the ESP Social Housing Adewole said \u201cabout 228 Manufacturers of Building Components have expressed interest in supplying inputs including doors, glazing, paint, roofing sheet, etc. We are now engaging with these to secure bulk supply of key materials which in turn will provide opportunity to grow their production capacity.\u201d\n\nAlready sites for early start projects have been identified in all the 6 geo-political zones in addition to the FCT. The sites include those in Ekiti and Ogun in the Southwest, Enugu, and Abia in the Southeast, Delta, and Edo in the South-south, Yobe, and Bauchi in the Northeast, Kaduna, and Katsina in the Northwest and Nasarawa and Plateau in the North-central. Sites have also been identified in Abuja including at Dei Dei where the Vice President earlier visited to see the sample designs of the Social Housing homes.\n\nSpeaking specifically on the mass housing scheme, Prof. Osinbajo emphasized that the focus must be on providing affordable housing for the masses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the Federal Government is going to intervene in housing, most of it should be social housing. Everybody else, including the private sector, can build N9.6 million worth houses, but nobody else will do social housing.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, when government intervenes, it is social housing\u2026those who cannot afford housing are the ones we must focus attention on.\n\n\u201cI think that we have enough problems with finding homes for the vast majority of Nigerians who cannot find a home. The people who are poorest who have no houses are the people we should target because that is what government should do. Let\u2019s focus on this social housing.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President added that the Federal Government will continue to collaborate with States to ensure more Nigerians benefit from the Social Housing scheme.\n\nUnder the Social Housing Programme, the Federal Government plans to support 1.5 million Nigerians to acquire low-cost houses through mortgage options and also Rent to Own option. The scheme is expected to also generate 1.8 million jobs and deliver houses to about 1.5 million Nigerian families.\n\n\u201cThe houses are to be priced around and about N2m and N4m each putting it within the reach of the low-income earners, depending on the number of rooms. There are one, two and three bedrooms options.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

But because of poverty, we are interested in the rice and stockfish that we eat for a day and in the remaining years, we will be suffering.\n\n\u201cIn 2023 we should decide in our hearts to reject this stockfish and rice and look for men of integrity, men who fear God, and who are righteous.

          "title": "How the media can get its groove back",
          "text": "By Yinka Adeosun\n\nSIR: It\u2019s that time of the year when the significance of a free press is brought to the fore. Globally known as World Press Freedom day, it is a day set aside to celebrate press freedom by reminding governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom, and as well remind media professionals of issues of press freedom and their respect for ethics.\n\nAs announced by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the theme of this year\u2019s commemoration is Information as a Public Good. This is an auspicious nudge for media professionals to acknowledge their importance in the society and take pleasure in their role as source of news and information in the society. As purveyors of a service that is classified as public good, journalists are obliged to pay serious attention to the veracity and relevance of information they dish out to the public.\n\nThe current state of the media is also aggravated by the weakening of the resistance by journalists to trends as permitted by the system. Here, truth is the victim. Lies, unverified claims have found their way into the prominent pages of many publications. The decentralization of the media and the unrestrained access to air your views which technology provides with the social media should not repudiate the time tested principles and values upon which journalism was founded.\n\nJust recently, the story of Ojonuwa Onu, the amputee hawker, who was identified as Mary Daniel, went viral. It is strange that the story as published by the mainstream media and copied by other online media was devoid of attribution and quotation by other persons that she mentioned in the story. Clearly, the reporter, who broke the story, was plagued by emotions. A diligent reporter would have verified some of the claims in her story\n\nUnder no circumstance should a journalist be overwhelmed by emotions. In fact, his emotional quotient should have suggested to him the need to seek for one or more relative or institution, that were referred to in her unsubstantiated story. Sadly, none of the media organisations which reported the story did anything close to that. The story which attracted the goodwill of kind-hearted Nigerians ended on an uncharitable note of fudged claims.\n\nSuch shoddy reportage is our bane at the moment. They fuel the pitch of anti-press sentiment, erosion of public confidence, mistrust and violence against journalists. How sad that social responsibilities and restraint are falling short of professional ethos, especially by mainstream media organisations. Gaffes by these respected media channels is fast eroding the trust and confidence we have placed in these organisations. Beyond the ordinariness of mediocrity and mad rush for breaking the news, the sanctity of professionalism and the sacrilege of publishing falsehood in any guise cannot be accepted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSame is the release of the CCTV footage of the minor being molested by the popular entertainment personality. That video is awful and distasteful. Many claim that the video was released out of public interest. While it may have aided the believability of the claims of the accusers against the accused, it further lends to the victimisation and stigmatisation of the victim. The right place for that CCTV video remains the court of law where it is admissible as evidence.\n\nAs the fourth estate of the realm, the media wields a powerful influence in the society. In addition to reporting the society and holding governments accountable, the media system, using its product \u2013 information \u2013 enables citizens to know their rights, duties and prerogatives, just as it also contributes to the general interest, and the service of sustainable development.\n\nAs the world celebrates and remembers world press freedom day, this year\u2019s theme is apt and timely for Nigerian media in particular, especially at a time like this. The role of media houses in enhancing the capacity of journalists to recognise and value the elements of information as a public good cannot be over-emphasised. This will further help them to defend and promote the type of content which they gather, produce and disseminate for public consumption.\n\nInformation as Public Good underscores the irrefutable substance of verified, reliable and beneficial information to the society. Once again, it is a clarion call to the essential role of professional journalists in the gathering, production and dissemination of information, by trashing misinformation, and other contents which may be considered harmful in the society.\n\nYinka Adeosun\n\nAkure, Ondo State.",

It is hard to imagine someone who campaigned to offer free education taking such a harsh decision particularly at this time.\n\nMore than anyone, Governor Nasir El-Rufai ought to know that education is a right and not a privilege; just as the burden of funding education should be borne by the government and not shifted to parents.\n\nReally, the hike in fees can only worsen the plight of the students in the situation that majority of them are from the less privileged backgrounds; in fact, majority are sons and daughters of peasant farmers, petty traders, vendors; few are civil servants living from hand to mouth. How does the governor expect them to pay such amount? Will these students not eventually drop out of school? If for nothing, the current security challenges ought to have dictated caution by the state government.\n\nDoes El-Rufa\u2019I appreciate that the security challenge the nation is currently experiencing is due chiefly to lack of education?\n\nNow, for the first time in Nigeria, students will pay nearly N300,000 in a public as against private university. Interestingly, there are private universities whose tuition fees are not even up to that amount!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIs it not ironic that governor that has sacked most of the parents and guardians of these students now wants to throw their wards out of school? Will this not have a negative impact on government\u2019s quest to develop the state\u2019s human capital? How about the potential contribution to the current restiveness particularly among the youths? Talk of unleashing more potential recruits for Boko Haram, thugs, bandits and kidnappers, cyber criminals and lots more.\n\nI call on the eminent leaders, civil societies, traditional rulers and every stakeholder to immediately intervene in the matter with a view to avert the impending doom that may arise from the situation. So also, the Academic Union of Universities (ASUU) particularly university chapter as indeed the Kaduna State University management must join hands to resist the plan as failure to do so will inevitably exacerbate the current crises not just in Kaduna State but the nation as a whole.",

          "title": "Anambra 2021: Any hope for female governorship aspirants?",
          "text": "In spite of special concessions by the political parties to aid female aspirants, only few women will contest for the office of governor in this year\u2019s elections in Anambra State. Associate Editor, Sam Egburonu , examines the issues that made it difficult for more women to vie for the office\n\nAs the primary elections for most of the political parties in this year\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State draws near, it has become clear that only very few women will ultimately contest for the governor\u2019s seat.\n\nThe Nation checks during the week show that in spite of the concessions by the major political parties to aid female aspirants, not many have shown interest to contest for the plum seat.\n\nIn the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which today has about 16 governorship aspirants already screened and cleared for the June 6, 2021 primary election, only three female aspirants are widely known. They include Uche Ekwunife, Ekwochi Genevieve and Chidi Onyemelukwe.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, it is not yet clear if any serious female aspirant will actually contest for the ticket of the other leading political parties like the ruling All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), All Progressives Congress (APC), the Young Progressive Party (YPP) and the Labour Party (LP).\n\nReports so far show that even if a few other female aspirants emerged in any of the other parties to join the female aspirants that are set to contest for PDP\u2019s ticket, the overall number of female aspirants for the forthcoming party primaries in Anambra State is poised to be so few that some observers have expressed concern over their chances. They contended that if care is not taken, the actual governorship election may not feature any female aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe way the campaigns are going, it is possible no female aspirant will get party ticket for the governorship election. In most of the leading political parties in the state, with the exception of the PDP, we are yet to see serious female aspirants with convincing structure. If we judge with these signs, it may not be wrong to anticipate that most of the political parties will eventually field male candidates,\u201d says Dr. Donatus Onyema, a political commentator.\n\nParties\u2019 efforts to aid female aspirants\n\nIn their efforts to encourage active participation of women in governance and politics, most of the leading political parties in the state reportedly set out special concessions for their female members.\n\nFor example, the All Progressives Congress (APC) announced that it would charge aspirants who will be seeking the party\u2019s ticket for the November 2021 Anambra Governorship Election the sum of N22.5m for expression of interest and nomination forms.\n\nIn a statement signed by the party\u2019s Director of Organisation, Al-Mustapha Medaner, the party said the expression of interest form costs N2.5 million while the nomination form costs N20 million.\n\nAccording to the statement, female aspirants and physically challenged aspirants are to pay 50 percent of the prescribed fees for the position.\n\nAlso, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) which fixed June 23 for the party\u2019s governorship primaries in the state, said in a statement that its Expression of Interest forms will cost N2 million, with Nomination forms priced at N20 million.\n\nIt also stated that female aspirants and aspirants living with disabilities will be granted 50 percent discount of the amount.\n\nThese special concessions notwithstanding, most of the female politicians expected to contest for their parties\u2019 tickets are yet to show commitment.\n\nReacting the apathy earlier, Mr. Nnamdi Nwagwu, the State Publicity of the PDP, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the party operates a gender-friendly policy where nomination fee is free for any aspiring woman. \u201cI really don\u2019t know why women are not showing interest. They don\u2019t pay nomination fee, the only thing any aspiring woman pays for is the Registration of Interest Form which costs N10, 000 only.\n\nIt\u2019s an official policy. \u201cSo, our party encourages women to contest because gender is no longer a barrier in politics. What a man can do, woman can equally do,\u201d he said. The APC Chairman in the state, Chief Basil Ejidike was also quoted as revealing that his party has been discussing with the women hoping they will show interest before the party primary.\n\n\u201cThe APC encourages women to participate in any level of election. While their male counterparts pay millions to purchase nomination form, it is totally free for the women.\n\n\u201cI am discussing with a number of our women and we believe that they will still show interest before the primary, either as governorship aspirants or running mates,\u201d Ejidike said.\n\nBut Mrs. Ugo Uzoma told The Nation during the week that the challenge women face in politics in Nigeria goes beyond financial constraint. \u201cMost of our women are discouraged more by electoral violence, unhealthy political environment, inferiority complex and the general attitude of male politicians most of who do not play by the rules.\u201d\n\nIn spite of these challenges, it is on record that some women, though comparatively few, are considered serious contenders of their parties\u2019 ticket. Chief among them are:\n\nUche Ekwunife\n\nSenator Uche Ekwunife, is perhaps the most visible female aspirant in the forthcoming party primaries.\n\nAn experienced grassroots politician, Ekwunife was elected as a representative in 2007 for Anambra\u2019s Anaocha/Njikoka/ Dunukofia Constituency.

          "title": "2023: It's unfair to say Igbo not prepared for presidency \u2013 Ikeyina",
          "text": "Senator Ebenezer Ikeyina, the National Leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and former lawmaker who represented Anambra Central at the Senate, in this interview with Emmanuel Udodinma , spoke on the prospect of Nigerian President of Igbo extraction in 2023. Excerpts\n\nWhat is your view on the clamour for a President of Igbo extraction?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat I can tell you is that as an elder statesman, I desire to have a country where everyone will have a stake in the country and be given a sense of belonging. It is unfortunate that the present composition of the country has actually marginalised a particular region of the country. The Southeast region of the country has been highly marginalised and so there is a need to talk about that and the best thing that I think that should be done is for Nigerians to allow the Southeast to present the President in 2023. I am not saying that the Presidency should be given on a platter of gold but what I am saying is that all the major political parties should zone the presidency to the region and when that happens, you would discover that the region would produce the next president. It is good for the sake of equity, peace and justice. If you look at what is happening in the region at the moment, you would also agree with me that zoning the presidency to the region will, to a large extent, douse tension and restiveness in the area.\n\nBut there are speculations that the region is not prepared for the presidency, judging by the fact that the people are not united and until that happens; it will be difficult for them to have the support of other regions. What is your thought on that?\n\nI disagree with that view. It is not true that Ndigbo are not united. If anybody has said that I will tell you that it is a ploy to deny the people their right. The Southeast people have been working assiduously on the presidency project for 2023 and it is no longer an issue that the region is prepared. I will give a very good example of the rigorous selection undertaken by the Association of South East Past Presidents-General to endorse one of their own for President in 2023. The Association of South East Past Presidents-General in November 2019 endorsed Professor Peter Nnanna Umeadi, former Chief Judge of Anambra State, for President in 2023. The selection was done from 2,000 communities in the five Southeast states in the region. The association, which has consistently decried marginalisation of Ndigbo in Nigeria affairs, especially as it concerns the leadership of Nigeria and based on research it discovered that part of the marginalisation is due to inability of Ndigbo to present a candidate with requisite credentials, antecedents and personal attributes, enough to win acceptability both in the Southeast and other regions across the country. The group came up with a common stand, and unanimously endorsed Professor Umeadi for President in 2023. If 2,000 communities could come together to agree and endorse one of their own, that, to an extent, confirms the readiness of Ndigbo for the task ahead. I must say that Ndigbo are ready, and no longer going to succumb to the dummy that Ndigbo are not united. The region is more than ever united now to support one of their own to become President in 2023. We are tired of that deceit that we are not united and do not deserve the support of other regions. If an association has endorsed one of their own since 2019 in readiness for 2023, it is simply passing one message to Nigerians that Ndigbo are ready to take their position in the scheme of things. All they are asking is the support of Nigerians for the sake of peace, equity and justice.\n\nDon\u2019t you think that the people will have a herculean task getting the support of other regions going by the secessionist tendency of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)?\n\nI don\u2019t think that IPOB should be a barrier to that aspiration. There have been agitations here and there across the country and it is not peculiar to the Southeast region, and if you can remember what I said earlier, that all these agitations are signs of dissatisfaction and indications that the people are not happy. If you treat them like others, give them a sense of belonging; all these agitations will fizzle out. I will, at this junction, appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari to use his good offices to ensure that someone from the Southeast succeeds him as President in 2023. It\u2019s possible to remember Buhari for handing power to a President of Igbo extraction, and he would have provided the healing balm.\n\nHow can you say that Ndigbo are ready when some politicians from the region are busy canvassing support for politicians from other regions?\n\nI am not aware of politicians from the region canvassing for someone from another region for President in 2023. The Presidency has rotated between Northern and Southern Nigeria and among the various geopolitical zones. The Southwest and South-south geopolitical zones in the southern part of the country have produced the President of Nigeria in the persons of Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan. Power is expected to rotate to the South in 2023, and as you know, the Southeast is the only zone in the South that is yet to produce a President of Nigeria in the current democratic dispensation. The Presidency has rotated between Northern and Southern Nigeria and among the various geopolitical zones with only the Southeast left out, with the region as a major geopolitical zone in Nigeria and Ndigbo, being one of the three predominant tribes in the country; they must take their rightful position in national polity.\n\nWhen you say that some people from the region are canvassing for people from other regions, then I would just tell you that they probably are not true sons and daughters of Igboland. There is a popular saying in Igbo parlance that, you cannot say that your mother\u2019s soup is not sweet. If we are to be sincere to ourselves, no person who truly loves peace will fail to support Ndigbo because we have supported other people in the past. We have supported the North. We supported the Southwest and we also supported the South-south; so why should our own be different? Are we not part of this country? Let me also remind you that we have had leading Igbo politicians, including members of the National and State Assemblies, ministers and other stakeholders, gather together to chart the way forward to realise the 2023 Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. The region has been over marginalised and we don\u2019t want to turn a blind eye to that. You can see that I have been passionately appealing to various political parties to make this work so that particular people are not treated as second class citizens. We have been witnessing a lot of political upheavals in recent time but we would have contributed in our own little ways as a people if we pave the way for peace.\n\nFrom other zones outside of the Southeast, there are already some influential aspirants with strong political bases across the various geo-political zones of the country. Do you think that there is any person in your region who can match such aspirants?\n\nIn as much as we cannot stop anyone from aspiring but I must tell you that the Southeast will get the support of other regions because work is already underway. Ndigbo of the Southeast geo-political zone is in continuous search of a system that guarantees and secures its social, political and economic interest, based on equality of citizenship, equity and justice. I make bold to say that the Southeast geo-political zone can find this in Nigeria. The journey to building an equitable society is usually challenging and rough, but many nations have arrived safely from this journey. For those of us who advocate for the President of Nigeria of Southeast extraction, all we need to do is diligently and boldly pursue it for the time has come and the time is now. It is also my view that the present-day political interest of the Southeast geo-political zone is to attain the Presidency of Nigeria come 2023. The people are ready to render the services and if supported by Nigerians, I will boldly say that the region will deliver because enough preparations have been made.",

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nPretty actress, Tayo Sobola popularly known as Sotayo Gaga by fans and colleagues in the movie industry has opened up on reasons she had a secret wedding and why she won\u2019t reveal her husband\u2019s identity.\n\nPictures of you wearing a wedding gown went viral recently, are you truly married?\n\nYes, I am married, but the truth is that it\u2019s not recent; I just decided to post the pictures on social media.\n\nHow come you didn\u2019t reveal your husband\u2019s identity?\n\nIt\u2019s because I wanted to keep my marriage and husband private. I am the star and one who\u2019s popularly known in the movie industry, not my husband. He\u2019s a private person, so there is no point exposing him to the public.\n\nNow that you are married, what should we expect from you?\n\nWell, nothing is changing about me. It\u2019s just that I have decided to spread out a little. I just opened my clothing line, Clean Stitches, but a lot of people still don\u2019t believe I own it; some think I just modeled for the brand. Now, we have opened a new branch in Abuja.\n\nWhy Abuja, is that where marriage has taken you?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not really because of marriage. I have a home here in Lagos; I also have a house in Abuja. And I have always been traversing Lagos and Abuja, and now that it is time to expand my business tentacles, I then thought of Abuja. Aside the fact that we have our clients all over the world, Abuja people patronise us a lot. If you notice my signature, you will realise that I deal with lots of boubou, and iro and buba, which are mostly rocked by classy or funky women. And trust me, Abuja has them plenty. So, I did my research and came to the conclusion that since I have a landed property there, and my shop too, I will have good sales. So, I made up my mind to open another branch in Abuja.\n\nAre you now fully into fashion and no more acting for Sotayo?\n\nNo. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am known in the industry already, so I can always go off and on and remain as if I never left. In life, there\u2019s always time and season\u2026there were times we were after fame, now we are after money.\n\nAre you saying that movies are no longer paying your bills?\n\nNot really, but for now, I want to concentrate on my business. There are some doors that being an actress will open that money might not open. So, both acting and business are paying.\n\nOf recent, one of your colleagues came out to say that she makes millions from acting, that they pay her up to N5 million per role. Could that be true?\n\nAbsolutely yes! Why not? Some (producers) can pay you as much as N10 million to feature in a movie, whereas another producer can pay you as low as N200, 000 for the same role. It all depends on your relationship and how you can sell their movie, and how much they have on ground for the production.\n\nFrom the productions you have done in the past, did you make such money?\n\nSo, you think I will invest in a project that will not profit me? Never! Let me tell you a clear truth, I have never produced a movie without making money in return. I am a businesswoman. How can I put my money down and not make profit from it?\n\nThere was a time you featured popular cross dresser, Bobrisky, in one of your movies, what informed that decision?\n\nIf you know me well, you will know that I don\u2019t discriminate. I have known Bobrisky since he was Idris, and if you watch that movie very well, you will see that I used it to pass a message whereby his \u2018younger sister\u2019 was manhandled because of the way he was trying to attract men to himself, and at end of it all, he gave up on that particular habit.\n\nHow and where did you meet your husband?\n\nOne thing people don\u2019t know is that I have been with my husband for over seven to eight years now.\n\nSo, you have been married that long?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get me wrong. We have only been married for a couple of months.\n\nWhere did both of you meet?\n\nLet me give you that as an assignment to find out. Thank you.\n\nBetween compact disc and Netflix, which one do you think brings more profit to the industry?\n\nBoth have their advantages and disadvantages. For the elite, who hardly watch television and can easily access any movie of their choice on their smart phones, they will go for Netflix, YouTube and the rest. For the typical trader, who hardly uses smartphones, they can\u2019t ever rule out compact disc or DVD as we may call it. If I should reason as a business owner, I will go for DVD, but civilization is timeless\u2026everyday we move with new trends.\n\nWould you say your clothing line has changed your dress sense to wearing boubou, iro and buba and abaya kind of clothes?\n\nI can slay iro and buba to the White House. I am someone who likes my comfort, although my mood most times dictates my dressing. But I will choose boubou and iro and buba over any other outfits anytime.\n\nRecently, the Nigerian music industry witnessed a turnaround when Wizkid and Burna Boy won the Grammys, do you think Nollywood movies too can win Oscar?\n\nWhy not? There\u2019s nothing that can never happen. You know, the way white people think is not the way we reason. Recently, Davido featured in Hollywood film, Coming To America 2, so who knows what the next move could be.\n\nWhat do you have to say about Yoruba movies shot with low budget and English movies with high budget and their production quality?\n\nTruly speaking, that\u2019s not the yardstick to determine a low or high budget movie. I can shoot with millions of naira and still have a very bad quality production, while some shoot with hundreds of thousands and get a very good quality job. And I can spend a month on location and still not come up with something good, while some people will spend few days or weeks and come out with a good job. So, all those things don\u2019t determine a good job at all.\n\nSo, no more movie roles for Tayo; it\u2019s all about Clean Stitches now?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get it twisted; you might see me in politics anytime soon.",

          "text": "From Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nNational Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Dr Yagbaji Sani, has said that rotational presidency, otherwise known as zoning, has not provided the needed economic development for the country, rather it has broadened the gap of division and nepotism.\n\nHe, therefore, suggested in this interview that political parties should always throw the contest open so that those with the needed administrative acumen would not be disenfranchised because of where they come from.\n\nThe former presidential candidate also joined the clamour for the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, sequel to his utterances on insurgency in the past.\n\nHe maintained that the spate of killings and kidnapping perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents is a by-products of Pantami\u2019s teachings.\n\nHe, however, backed the Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Mahmud Gumi, for facilitating negotiations with bandits and parents of kidnapped children, adding that he has not done anything wrong.\n\nHe also encouraged political leaders to judiciously utilise resources in their possession to create employment, build schools, hospitals and roads, in order to keep the youth busy. Except:\n\nWhat is your take on the spate of insecurity in the country?\n\nIf truth must be told, I believe it is the consequences of leadership failure. Because when there is leadership failure, definitely, you will see that even the most basic things that should be taken care of will not be addressed properly. Because when you look at democracy or any form of government at all, in fact, even in constitution, the two fundamental responsibilities of the government is the issue of security and the welfare of the people. That is what the constitution says. Any government that cannot provide the two things for its citizens has no moral rights to expect respect from the citizens. And if care is not taken it might even get to a revolt; the people may rebel against you because you have not been able to take care of the basic requirements. So, I believe that why what is happening is happening is because we have leadership failure. Period.\n\nWhile the PDP is pushing for a summit to discuss the way forward on insecurity, the APC is not seeing the need for such a meeting. How do we address the problem?\n\nBoth the APC and PDP are one and the same. It is six and half a dozen. That is what it is. You see, when you look at APC and you throw back your attention and recollect what happened during the PDP era, it is just a re-enactment of what happened during the PDP era only that this time around it is more endemic. There seems to be a total collapse of the situation today. We are just afraid that the whole thing will collapse under the PDP. But PDP was not better than what we are seeing under APC. Under PDP, Boko Haram insurgents were even coming to Abuja attacking people, and exploding everywhere. People were afraid just like what we have now. People were not free to move around. But the case we have today is worse; which means that the situation has been degrading from the PDP time till now. So, it is like a case of a kettle calling the pot black. There is nothing that the PDP is accusing the APC today that it did not do. There was leadership failure under the PDP too. And what we are running away is for Nigeria to run away from the situation we have found ourselves today. So, the issue is that Nigerians must start to think and look away from these two parties. Nigeria is bigger than PDP and APC because we transcend those parties. Nigeria does not start and end with APC and PDP. And, when you look at it, the same people that were in PDP in which we were having the problem are the same people today that are in APC. So, it is not as if outside these people you do not have Nigerians that can take care of this country. The situation we have in this country is that Nigerians do not want to rise to the occasion themselves. We must begin to see the futility of continuing to support these two parties in government because they do not have what Nigeria needs. And what Nigeria needs today are people who have this country at heart and have the competence and capability to deliver this 21st Century economy that we have which is a promise of greatness. There is nothing that we need in this economy to make it great that is not there. What is lacking is leadership. What is lacking is the fact that our process of the recruitment of leadership is still at that stage of people manipulating the levers of power and rigging elections to bring in people that cannot deliver. So, if you have your process of recruitment of leadership as corrupt as it is, there is no way you can dream of having people that would live up to expectations or be ready to give this country the kind of leadership that it deserves. So, this is why we are just in a vicious cycle. And both the APC and PDP, believing in me, everybody in this country knows that they are one and the same. It is the same bad dream that we had during the last administration that we are having today. Nigerians never thought that we will be where we are in this country today. Why because we have competent people. We have the resources. We have the statute as a nation which is respected across the globe. That is why anywhere you go Nigerians are respected because they know what you are worth; in terms of resources, leadership and capacity. So, when you talk about PDP or APC, believing in me, it is those that what you can call failure of our circumstances. We just found ourselves in almost a failed state. Look at what happened during Jonathan, the international community had come to rescue Nigeria. It is because Nigeria was almost failing as a nation. Today, we are in a worse situation that we need to be rescued that is why some people are saying that we should look for foreign assistance. It is because Nigeria was almost failing. The political class you have today that are in charge of the affairs of this country have failed. The truth is that they do not have what Nigeria needs so they cannot give that leadership. That is why people should look at the direction of ADP. God knows why he put parties like ours in this country today. It is to rescue this country. There is nothing we will do today that will give this country the kind of progress, peace and unity that are required under another APC or PDP government. It will never happen. Because when they come in instead of concentrating on building the nation they will just be talking about things that are not relevant. The issue is that we have come to the stage where another set of people should be allowed to run the affairs of this country. We can do it. It has been proven that things cannot change unless we the followership change. And change is an option. If it is a situation where we do not have an option that would be a different thing entirely. So, the blame game is all because we do not want to change. So, the press has a lot to do here. The press can make this country work by ensuring that it changes the narrative. It should not be about PDP and APC. Nigerians should begin to understand that there is an option or alternative that is more credible that can give this country a leadership that would provide new path to progress, prosperity, unity and pragmatic leadership that will unleash this huge potential that we have as a country. Everybody knows that we are a country that is of promise of greatness by everything that we need to have. Look at the leadership we have today that is not even engaged with the people. As bad as the situation is you should have a kind of interaction with your people. But that is not happening. Money is given out and nobody is accounting for it even for the insecurity you are talking about. Billions of naira have been given to this people, nobody is telling us what happened to those monies, how it was spent. If it was their own money, none of them would allow things like this to happen; that you spent billions and there is nothing to show for it. There is evidence of arms purchased, no money in the account and to the extent that they are even asking for more money. They want to be given more budget to fight this war as if we are people that have saw-dust in our brains. We need to break from this rigmarole and the narrative of PDP and APC. We still have two years to go. It can be done. The press can lead. Every country where meaningful change happened, it is the press that leads the way.\n\nDo you also subscribe to the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, following his utterances on insurgency?\n\nI have told you about leadership failure. Where you have leadership, government will not wait for this thing to happen whether wrong of right. The man is not denying what he said or didn\u2019t say. He did. So, the issue is that government, particularly the president, should realise the fact that he was elected by the people of this country and he swore by the Quran that he was going to protect the interest of this country; that he was going to exert fear or favour. So, when you have discovered that in one reason or the other you have a minister in your cabinet that has been accused of most of the things that are happening today in terms of insecurity, whether remotely or anyhow you want to look it, at least, to demonstrate to the nation that he is representing them and that he is living up to his responsibility, this man should be eased out because he did not deny it. Why are we having the problem we are having today? It is because of people that had, or still have those kind of mentality, and their ideology is not in tune with the modern way of doing things. He said he did, but he is recanting that he is not in that kind of belief anymore. But, we are suffering from the by-products. That is what snowballed into what we are having today. It is those people that you taught, those radical thinking that are still in the bush. Even though you have now said that you have renowned that ideology, we are still suffering from the damage in this country. Because that is why we still have the likes of Boko Haram people that are thinking differently. Yes, he has apologised. If the country wants, it can forgive him or allow the law to take its course. But, the right thing to be done is for the government to relief him of his duties and responsibilities, and then let him understand that what he did, the country is still suffering from it. In other climes, if you are in government of a high school, and they discovered that you raped a girl or smoked marijuana, you would be in trouble. There was a judge of a Supreme Court that was supposed to be appointed in America, you can see the extent they went because a woman came out and said the man took advantage of her in a high school. It became an issue. So, it is not enough to come out and apologise. He should not be allowed to continue in office in all fairness given the circumstances we are in today, and given the fact that we cannot divorce those radical ideologies we are having today. So, he is responsible.\n\nAre you comfortable with the role being played by Sheikh Gumi in negotiating with bandits?\n\nUnder this circumstance or the situation we are in, it is the right thing to do. Do you know why? The government has denied people money they are supposed to use to build hospitals, schools and roads. They come to Abuja, collect the money, sit down in a room and divide the money among themselves, thinking that the people are stupid or they do not know what is happening. If they are using the billions collected from the federation account to build schools, hospitals and good roads you would not have bandits. If some have jobs and leave their houses at 8:00a.m to go to work, would they have time to go into the bush? That is why they are taking it by force. So, under this scenario, it is right. Let them sit up. Let them stop stealing. Let them use the money to create employment and not to buy houses in Dubai or Europe and always going for vacation. They have exhausted all the civil ways of doing things, that is why they are in the bush. Gumi is right. When Buhari came to power he said 70 per cent of the budget is being stolen. But what did he do about it? And you want the people to just fold their hands and be watching you?\n\nThough we still have two years to the next general election, there has been this agitation for the Southeast to produce the next president. What is your take?\n\nI do not like to indulge in what I call a very high intelligent way of looking at issues in the country. The problem we have in this country transcends zoning. They are more serious than where the president of Nigeria should come from. Why are we where we are today? It is because of the issue of zoning. You can take it from the Jonathan\u2019s time to now. It is just because they did not allow the best material to emerge as the president of this country; it was always handpicked. It has always taken religious dimension as if when it comes to the issues of the country the person can do better. We should wake up and begin to think about this country as a serious business. If in your private business you start bringing in sentiments like employing your brothers even when they are not competent, what would happen to the business? Definitely, it will fail. For God sake, let us be serious. The position of the president requires more than what we are attributing to it. I look at it as lazy and people who are not serious in their way of thinking. In social club you can do that, but when it comes to the issue of president, we should have a checklist as a nation. We should look at track records and performances that will matter. This is doable. The leaders of thoughts are there to do it. The press is there. It can set the agenda and change the narrative. Look at where we are today. We are a laughing stock simply because there is a leadership failure and because we did not do the right thing. If zoning is working, why are people in Katsina being killed like chicken? Why is the whole North on fire? The business of running the country is a very serious business. It is not about this man is a Yoruba man, or Hausa man or an Igbo man. Let us begin to look at tract records. If you look at countries that have gone passed us like Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, most of them jettisoned the idea of where a person is coming from. Because when you do that you have completely disjointed the whole issue of running the country from what it should be to what has no relevance in the governance itself. And that is why we are always failing.\n\nWhat is the prospect of ADP in the next general election?\n\nIt is very bright. Do not mind the ballooning of membership they are telling people. Believe me, by the time the two parties will explode you will see what will happen. We believe that the ADP has a very unique opportunity in 2023 because Nigerians will wake up. And sane people who have the country at heart will look for a party like ADP to begin to build Nigeria and not themselves or tribes because that is what we represent. We are the Noah\u2019s Ark that will take the country to the Promised Land.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nDetermined in stopping bandits from infiltrating Abuja, security forces have commenced massive deployment of personnel and equipment to all entry and exit points of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThis is coming barely 24 hours after Daily Sun exclusively reported that the military high command had approved a massive deployment of special forces to fringe towns and villages where bandits are believed to be taking refuge.\n\nSunday Sun investigation revealed that security operatives have also commenced raid on major spots in Kogi, Niger and Nasarawa states just as they have commenced demolition and raids on all known criminal hideouts within and around the FCT.\n\nThe security agencies made up of a joint task force are also said to be raiding major motor parks, uncompleted buildings, markets, mechanic workshops and villages, where criminals and bandits are believed to be hiding.\n\nIt was gathered that following the alarm raised by residents of Bwari, a satellite town in the FCT, the military in conjunction with security agencies swung into action.\n\nThe military, Sunday Sun gathered, is on red alert to counter any terrorists invasion. The Forward Operation Bases (FOB) is also combing the forests within Keffi, Niger and Kogi states, where some of the terrorists were said to have set up their camps. The camps have been demolished.\n\nA security source who does not want to be mentioned told Sunday Sun that the security agencies are also clamping down on illegal drug sellers, especially the hawkers, as it has been discovered that they have direct contacts with the criminals.\n\nThe source identified Maraba, Masaka, Nyanya Motor park, Kugbo, Kubwa, Dutse, Apo, Gwagwalada, Gwagwa, Mpape, Asokoro village, Garki village, Jabi motor park, Utako market, Nyanya market, Zuba, Suleja, Abuja/Keffi road, Lugbe, Kuje, Orozo, Kado, among others as some of the identified spots in Abuja.\n\nThe Guards Brigade, which is saddled with the primary assignment of providing security for the president, his immediate family, VIPs, the FCT and the surrounding states, has deployed enough manpower and equipment to give any criminal group that may want to cause trouble heat, it was gathered.\n\nThe Army Headquarters Garrison is also said to have deployed its men, especially in plain clothes, to some of these places to checkmate activities of criminals.\n\nThe source told Sunday Sun that the military cannot afford to allow criminals, especially bandits and terrorists, into the FCT.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI can tell you that we are on red alert. We know there is tension over terrorists\u2019 invasion of the FCT after the Niger State governor raised the alarm that the terrorists would soon come here. We know they would come and we are ready for them. Already, our men are all over the place to battle these men. Abuja is the last place we will allow them to come and carry out their atrocities.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that prior to the alarm raised by the Niger State governor, over possible invasion of the FCT, bandits had taken over some FCT villages, kidnapping innocent villagers, including traditional rulers, security operatives on a regular basis and collecting ransom from their relatives.\n\nRecently, bandits invaded an orphanage home and abducted over eight orphans. The police said they were carrying out a covert operation to rescue the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, following social media reports that kidnappers had infiltrated the nation\u2019s capital, the FCT Police Commissioner, Bala Ciroma, in a statement assured that the FCT was not under attack by terrorists, urging the residents not to panic, as the police have put all security measures in place to protect lives and property.\n\nBut despite the assurances, activities of criminals have continued to thrive in the FCT.\n\nCiroma in a statement signed by the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, said: \u201cThe attention of the FCT Joint Security Team has been drawn to a viral publication in the social media purporting that the \u2018Federal Capital Territory is under the attack of Boko Haram terrorists\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Security Team of the FCT wishes to refute the mischievous publication targeted at creating palpable tension amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT. Contrary to the speculation, the Heads of Security Agencies (HOSA) in the Federal Capital Territory in the bid to address security concerns within the FCT, held a strategic meeting on Thursday 29th April, 2021, where the team resolved to deploy alternative proactive crime-fighting measures within the FCT particularly in areas with challenging terrain including aggressive motorized/foot patrols.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, more schools have shutdown in Abuja, following threats by bandits to attack and abduct students. The mass closure of schools kicked off on Wednesday. On Thursday and Friday, more schools sent their students home.\n\nGovernment schools are not left out, despite repeated assurances by the FCT administration that the schools were safe. The worst hit areas are Bwari, Kuje, Kwali and Abaji.",

          "text": "\u2022Debates frequent students\u2019 abductions, boko haram attacks\n\nBayo Akinloye\n\nWorried about the nation\u2019s unceasing insecurity, the United Kingdom\u2019s parliament, the House of Commons, has held consistent debates between April 12 and 22 over the continued abductions of students and the sustained attacks by Boko Haream\u2019s insurgents.\n\nThe lawmakers debate, THISDAY understood, centred around understanding the situation in Nigeriaand subsequently providing assistance to her government.\n\nFor example, on April 12, lawmaker Jim Shannon, the Democratic Unionist Party MP for Strangford, sought to find out what discussions the UK government had had with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration on helping to prevent the kidnap of children from schools.\n\nIn response, James Duddridge, the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the kidnapping and continued captivity of schoolchildren by Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in North-East Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe British High Commission continues to raise these cases with the Nigerian government, most recently in March 2021. We are also concerned by the recent attacks on schools in Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, and Katsina states, conducted by criminal groups.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cI publicly condemned these attacks and stressed the importance of all children being able to access an education without fear. The UK Deputy National Security Advisor discussed the abduction of Nigerian schoolboys in Kankara in Katsina State with the president\u2019s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, on December 15, 2020.\n\n\u201cOur High Commissioner in Abuja spoke to the Inspector General of the Nigerian Police on improving school safety and addressing kidnapping in March 2021.\u201d\n\nDuddridge explained that the UK provided mentoring and capacity building for units of the Nigerian Police Force to improve their anti-kidnap capacity and response to organised crime groups in Nigeria.\n\nThe following week, on April 19, another UK lawmaker, Stephen Doughty, the Labour (Co-op) MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, demanded from the British government an assessment of the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East following recent attacks and the displacement of people in the Damasak area.\n\nDuddgride explained that the UK government was concerned by the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East, where terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa, continue to attack local communities.\n\nShedding more light on his assessment, he noted, \u201cRecent attacks on Damasak in Borno State, in which civilians, humanitarian workers, and facilities were targeted, have led to a worsening humanitarian situation, and the displacement of local residents and internally displaced people to Niger or other areas of north-east Nigeria. As the UK government has repeatedly made clear, humanitarian workers should never be a target.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated to the House of Commons that the UK remained \u201ccommitted to helping Nigeria tackle the threat posed by the terrorist groups\u201d in the North-East, adding, \u201cWe are providing significant humanitarian and stabilisation assistance to support affected communities, including those who have been displaced.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s findings also showed that 60 to 69 UK-based staff were posted by the then Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development and currently Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office to all posts in Nigeria as of March 31, 2021.\n\nOn April 20, another legislator Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, asked specifically about the threat to Christians amid killings in Nigeria.\n\nIn response, Duddridge stated that the UK condemned all violence against civilians in Nigeria, irrespective of religion. He pointed out that in the North-East, terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWA, \u201ccontinue to cause immense suffering to both Muslim and Christian\u201d communities.\n\n\u201cThese groups seek to undermine the right to freedom of religion or belief by indiscriminately attacking those of all faiths, who do not subscribe to their extremist views,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further told the House of Commons that intercommunal violence across multiple states also \u201chas a devastating impact\u201d on Christian and Muslim communities and disclosed that the \u201cunderlying drivers of violence are complex, and frequently relate to competition over resources and increasing criminality.\u201d\n\nOn April 26 and 27 April, the UK minister disclosed that he met with \u201ca range of Nigerian interlocutors, including governors\u201d from some northern states and Nigerian government representatives, including the foreign affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama.\n\n\u201cI raised the need for all communities to be protected amidst increasing insecurity\u2026We will continue to encourage the Nigerian government to take urgent action to protect all communities and to implement long-term solutions that address the root causes of violence,\u201d he told the parliament.\n\nThe UK envoy also told the House of Commons about the issues of LGBT in Nigeria, noting that the UK government is worried about the criminalisation of homosexuality, recognising that there is a long way to go before all LGBT people can live free and equal lives in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking of the country and others in Africa, Duddridge explained, \u201cWe make regular representations to governments around the world on this issue, including in Uganda, Ghana, Namibia and Nigeria. We work through our Embassies and High Commissions, as well as international organisations, including the UN, Council of Europe, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Commonwealth, to promote non-discrimination towards LGBT people, and to address discriminatory laws.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe directly challenge governments that criminalise homosexuality at the highest political levels.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Kaduna Gov: Ortom attacks the president to hide his failure\n\n\u2022Benue Gov: El-Rufai is misleading Buhari and has divided Kaduna\n\nGeorge Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe disturbing security situation in the country appears to have turned two governors against each other as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom have thrown caution to the wind, attacking each other over the security situation in the country.\n\nNasir el-Rufai fired the first salvo, ostensibly in support of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he claimed Governor Ortom only uses the insecurity in his state to attack the Buhari-led administration as a way to cover up for his own failure.\n\nBut an obviously agitated Ortom immediately fired back and came down heavily on his Kaduna State counterpart, accusing him of not only misleading President Buhari to gain favours, but also one of the real enemies of the country.\n\nEl-Rufai, who first hit at Ortom while responding to a video, which featured Ortom addressing protesters after some killings in Benue State, during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group, claimed he no longer took his Benue colleague seriously.\n\n\u201cI did not hear what Governor Ortom said (in the video) but I know him and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, el-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating E-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his State several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Eyes N30 billion in second quarter\n\nObinna Chima\n\nDespite the decline in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) last year due mainly to the effects of COVID-19, Ogun State Government raked in N21 billion in the first quarter of this year. Governor Dapo Abiodun disclosed this in a statement on Friday, saying the state has perfected plans to generate over N100 billion in 2021.\n\nAbiodun spoke at a special Iftar (breaking of fast) with members of the House of Representatives, House of Assembly, State Executive Council, and the Body of Permanent Secretaries. He stressed that his administration was committed to putting the state on a strong financial and economic footing through creative governance.\n\nThe governor said the dip in the state\u2019s IGR in 2020 was due to drop in earnings from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE), tax incentives given to industries in the state, and lack of revenue from the education sector.\n\nHe said the target for the second quarter of 2021 was N30 billion.\n\nAbiodun stated, \u201cOur IGR dipped in 2020 and there are some reasons for that \u2013 there was no Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for us during the COVID-19 period, we gave incentives to industries because they couldn\u2019t work during that period, and because we are the education capital of the country, a lot of our IGR was coming from the tertiary institutions and because there were no students in schools, the revenue did not come in.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what the good news is, the good news is that first quarter of 2021, we already got N21 billion.\n\n\u201cLast year, we did N58 billion, so we\u2019ve already gotten half of what we got last year in one quarter. This present quarter, we will do at least N30 billion, and by the end of this year, by the grace of God, we will do over N100 billion in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration discovered that Land Use Charge was not being paid in the state, stressing that it inherited a database of 14,000 people from the previous administration. He said the discovery led his administration to put in place mechanisms, which had helped the state to realise a database of Land Use Charge for over 1.5 million people. \u201cThis will translate into a lot for our administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nAbiodun stated that his administration would soon launch Ogun State Land Administration and Management System (OLAS) to help residents of the state who had built on government property to come and regularise their papers.\n\n\u201cThat system using ICT, we are going to ensure that all those that have built, we are starting with government owned property alone, all those that have built on government property will have to come and regularise their papers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are not talking about those that built on any other land, we are talking of government land alone, so we bring them in to regularise their papers.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the state of the nation and the intended reversal of the new minimum wage by some states, the governor said his administration, being one of the first to sign the minimum wage into law, was committed to the continuous payment of the new wage to its workforce.\n\nHe stated, \u201cNot only did we implement it, my colleagues are now reversing the minimum wage because they can\u2019t pay it. Some of my colleagues have even asked me if I am sure I can keep on paying the minimum wage, I told them that Ogun State is not like other states, that in Ogun State, we have to keep on paying the wage.\n\n\u201cSo, I am committing to the very excellent public service that I have that I will continue to pay the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nAbiodun urged members of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), to democratically put their best candidates forward at the forthcoming local government elections in the state. He assured that everything would be done in consonance with the principles of democracy.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the deputy governor, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, commended the governor for his quality leadership, saying this is behind the giant strides of his administration in the last two years.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe share of United States dollar reserves held by central banks across the world fell to 59 per cent\u2014its lowest level in 25 years, during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThis is according to the just-released International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) survey.\n\nSome analysts claimed this partly reflected the declining role of the US dollar in the global economy, in the face of competition from other currencies used by central banks for international transactions.\n\nIf the shifts in central bank reserves were large enough, they could affect currency and bond markets.\n\nThe dollar acts as the primary reserve currency for the global economy, and foreign exchange reserves in central banks around the world account for the bulk of the US dollar.\n\nAccording to the survey, the share of US dollar assets in central bank reserves dropped by 12 percentage points\u2014from 71 to 59 per cent\u2014since the euro was launched in 1999, although with notable fluctuations in-between.\n\nIt noted that the share of the euro has fluctuated around 20 per cent, while the share of other currencies including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Chinese renminbi climbed to 9 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe value of the US dollar has been broadly unchanged, while the US dollar\u2019s share of global reserves has declined, indicating that central banks have indeed been shifting gradually away from the US dollar.\n\nSome expected that the US dollar share of global reserves would continue to fall as emerging market and developing economy central banks sought further diversification of the currency composition of their reserves.\n\nA few countries, such as Russia, have already announced their intention to do so.\n\nBut despite major structural shifts in the international monetary system over the past six decades, the US dollar has remained the dominant international reserve currency. Any changes to the US dollar\u2019s status are likely to emerge in the long run, the survey noted.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had on April 27, 2018, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria signed a Currency Swap Agreement with the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) on behalf of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe swap deal, an agreement with a three-year tenor, allows both the CBN and PBoC to swap a maximum amount of 15 billion Renminbi/Chinese Yuan (CNY 15 billion) for N720 billion.\n\nThis amount is equivalent to $2.5 billion using the prevailing exchange rate of N305:$1 at the time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The document with reference number INEC/DE/No:72/2021 and titled: \u201cDecision Extraction on the Amendment of the Threshold for the Conversion of Voting Points to Polling Units,\u201d reads in part: \u201cThe Commission at its meeting held on Tuesday, April 20, 2021, deliberated on the above subject and approved as follows: The adjustment of the lower and upper thresholds for Voting Points from 750 and 1000 to 500 and 750, respectively\n\n\u201cThat the ICT and Electoral Operations Departments and the state and local government area offices of the Commission should adopt these new thresholds in implementing the ongoing programme of expanding voting access to Polling Units.\n\n\u201cYou may wish to refer the extract to all Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) and Directors for information and necessary action, please.\u201d\n\nMaryam Iya Musa, a director at the Commission, signed the memo.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye, had earlier told THISDAY that the commission planned to create new polling units from the existing 119,973 polling centres. Okoye said INEC would create additional 57,023 polling units, to make the proposed 176,996 polling centres\n\nThis is coming 25 years after the defunct National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) created the existing polling units, which INEC has been using.\n\nUnder the new polling centres, units would have between 500 and 750 voters.\n\nPutting all elements into consideration, INEC, THISDAY gathered, had settled for the application of 500 lower limit and 750 upper limit.\n\nUnder the former INEC leadership, headed by Professor Attahiru Jega, the commission planned the creation of 30,000 polling units. In the new polling centres before it was rejected, northern states had over 21,000 while the entire South got a little above 8,000.\n\nVoting point platform, as widely known and accepted by stakeholders, was based on lower and upper thresholds of 750 and 1,000 registered voters, respectively.\n\nBut, as at press time, the commission was yet to give a breakdown of state-by-state or zone-by-zone of the polling centres.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Remember that we had some form of state, regional police. We had an ordinance 4 of 1916 that formally established regional police, native authority police in the north, and also in western Nigeria,\u201d Nnamani said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere were factors that led to the abolition of state police. With the 1966 coup and the emergence of the Ironsi government, a government committee was appointed to study policing in Nigeria. They presented their report in 1968. All those factors that led to the abolition of regional police and formal entry into the state police have not changed.\n\n\u201cNigeria is organic; it\u2019s one unit. For you to have state police, it means it has to be uniform in the 36 states; it has to be standardised in the 36 states. If it is not uniform, then it is inherently unequal.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have state police in a state like Lagos state with a poverty rate of 10 to 20 percent, compared to states that have poverty rate of 81 percent. How are you going to pay them?\n\n\u201cSo, if you police Lagos effectively, what is the guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to police states in other regions effectively? The standards are going to be different. Then, of course, there are the factors that led to the abolition of state police in the beginning \u2014 elite capture of the system, influence by political and traditional players.\u201d",

How can somebody who has been serving the church for 25 years come out to begin to fight the same church. Everything in my life is for the church,\u201d he said in the sermon monitored by TheCable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, Father Mbaka here has no problem with the church. I don\u2019t have any problem with my bishop; people want to achieve it but they cannot allow it. Because I have something in me that will conquer all this problem \u2014 the gift of humility and the obedience of the church.\u201d\n\nMbaka recalled how thousands of his followers invaded the premises of the Catholic cathedral and the residence of the bishop while searching for him.\n\nHaving been summoned before the protest, he said the church leadership immediately directed him to go and bring the protesters out as they had vowed that \u201cthings will get bad\u201d if they don\u2019t see him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never knew that even a glass was broken. What I was praising you for was not for what was destroyed, but for your ability to search for your missing pastor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of mixed information. The devil entered the story; the church did not kidnap me.\n\n\u201cI wish to apologise for whoever that misunderstood my statement. I did not clap for anybody for destroying anything. I heard that the search for Father Mbaka was hijacked; people joined and started breaking things.\n\n\u201cI am here standing on your behalf and I render my sincere, unalloyed apologies to the Holy Catholic church where I belong, and say, may the mother church forgive us in any way we didn\u2019t do it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven in all that I said, where I didn\u2019t say it well, I pray for forgiveness. I am on your (the worshippers) behalf, kneeling down for the church and I tell the church, forgive.\u201d\n\nThe cleric said he has no problem with the church and restated that he remains loyal to the bishop.\n\n\u201cWe are to save the image and face of the church, and the souls of the children of God. I am here for soul-saving, the church is not my property because I belong to the church,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Catholic church in Enugu had declared one week of prayer over the violent protest about the priest\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protest heightened the tension that was caused by Mbaka\u2019s recent clash with the presidency over a controversial contract.",

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "The Voice of Nigeria: FirstBank imprints in entertainment, youth empowerment",
          "text": "By Israel Bolaji-Gbadamosi\n\nOne of the key metrics that well defines a truly 21st century brand beyond profit making is its ability to connect with customers and stakeholders as a complete enabler, touching on vital aspects of their lives, creating exciting memories and enabling them to access more enjoyable and convenient lifestyle, in shopping, studying, working, traveling, family living, entertainment and aspirations.\n\nIts ability to also give back to the community through tangible corporate social investment programs that significantly translate to improved living and not just mere formality and publicity stunts is also pertinent.\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Limited (FirstBank) is giving a good account of itself in this regard not only as a truly financial powerhouse but also as a life enabler, helping Nigerians live better and achieve their dreams.\n\nIn retrospect, banking, decades ago, was essentially about providing financial services and products to merely aid customers\u2019 financial transactions. However, the smart ones are indeed changing the game. Not only is the envelope being pushed to ensure that the unbanked are banked through financial inclusion offers even to the remotest villages, FirstBank has taken banking to another level. Backed by superior technology firepower and capacity, it is assisting not only adults but also Nigerian youths to live better and fulfil their dreams.\n\nThe Nigerian nation and the most populous black nation of the world indeed has a youths bulge as observed by many experts with a growing army of young and vibrant people below 25 years of age constituting over 60% of its 200million population! While an unrelenting rate of unemployment, weak economy, soaring inflation and despair appear to dominate the national mentality, many youths are finding solace in entertainment, breaking the ceiling with their creative ingenuity, shunning out award winning hits and in fact making global headlines in music and other entertainment offshoots like movies, comedy skits and contemporary dance.\n\nNigeria\u2019s 29 year old singer, Damini Ogulu popularly called Burna Boy in March shocked the world winning the world\u2019s most coveted Grammy Award in the Best World Music category during the 63rd annual edition in Los Angeles Atlanta while another 30 year old Nigerian artiste, Ayo Balogun aka Wizkid was also a co-winner in the Best Music Video category for Beyonce\u2019s Brown Skin Girl. These young Nigerian global music icons were raised and honed their skills in the suburbs of Nigeria through home grown competitions and platforms.\n\nMusic reality shows have also unveiled and nurtured music and entertainment talents like Timi Dakolo, Iyanya, Praise, Omawumi and other A-list musicians in Nigeria. This is why FirstBank\u2019s intervention and sponsorship of a music and youths talents harnessing platform like The Voice Nigeria is strategic and instructive, and quite capable of helping to harness and nurture music and entertainment talents into celebrated musicians, make global stars of Nigerian youths, and truly help them achieve their dreams. Obviously, Firstbank has been a prominent force visibly empowering talents and the nation, and without the much-needed lifeline, many young talents would be taking to crime or other vices.\n\nFor over 127 years, the premier bank has been at the forefront of nation building; supporting through resourceful partnerships to build the Nigerian creative industry value chain which contributed 2.3 per cent (N239 billion) to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2016 (NBS).\n\nThe bank\u2019s support for the Voice Nigeria is also a demonstration of its commitment to contributing to the projected revenue of US$86m by 2021 from the Nigeria\u2019s music industry aimed at promoting a diversified economy in line with the Federal Government\u2019s diversification policy.\n\nThe bank assured that it has given voice to Nigerians for the past 127 years, and will continue to give voice to Nigerians by creating employment, economic empowerment in the country through its products, services and initiatives and it remains committed to strengthening the creative industry which is fast growing into a multibillion-dollar business, with potential to be a leading contributor to Nigeria\u2019s GDP in the near future.\n\nIn fact, FirstBank has the network; reach and digital capability to enable the Voice. With its agent banking network across the nooks and crannies in country, it is helping in the search for the talent that will become a true inspiration to all.\n\nTrue to the name, the Voice Nigeria has lived up to its promise, as it offers exciting and relaxing entertainment to families, music lovers, and other entertainment loving Nigerians who look forward to fresh seasons and episode of the well-crafted music program.\n\nNow in its season 3, the Reality TV show has been a masterpiece in the last six episodes of the current season as viewers are serenaded by several awesome performances and display of raw talents on the show\u2019s blind auditions which ended on Saturday, May 1. The episode ended with raging emotions, exhilarating sensations and blistering anticipation as the four judges \u2013 Falz The Bad Guy, Waje, Yemi Alade and Dare Art Alade had one final opportunity to forge their winning team.\n\nSo far, the coaches, hosts, producers and amazing talents have been a great delight to watch. They have been awesome with their good-natured banters, hilarious drama, top-notch fashion, electrifying opening performances, talent courting speeches, and chair turning and bell thumping spectacle. The optics is exciting! The expectation on the show has been so intense; you could cut with a butter knife. The coaches\u2019 approach at winning talents over to their team has been fun and a fine blend.\n\nThere were no holds barred, as the judges were very warm, animated, upbeat, inspiring and full of energy. They were definitely not a team of avuncular examiners waiting to pass judgments. They brought much gusto and effect to the big stage! While Falz threw up his magical comic card severally, Dare maintained the cool dude posture while Yemi and Waje both brought on the alluring feminine appeal with Waje sometimes speaking in Igbo to convince a talent. In all, they fared well, each getting a fair share of talents to mentor and their combination depicted a perfect combo.\n\nThe talents on their part have not disappointed viewers. They came in different shades across both genders, with varying voice textures, mix and pitches \u2013 smooth, silky, velvet, shrill, husky, coarse or simply rough. And to the best of their abilities, they did justice to many songs, including some classic tunes and old hits. The creative fusion of multiple genres of music by some smart talents who beautifully delivered unique blend of music made good impressions which won the judges hearts. The awful looks on the faces of those who the judges would simply not behold, having failed to captivate their attention with the voice. The uncontrollable joy of those who got the bell ring and standing ovation and the incredible looks on their loved ones who came to show support. Not forgetting the jazzy presence and reassurances from the co-hosts including Toke Makinwa and Nancy Ikime which also complimented the soothing potpourri.\n\nInterestingly, FirstBank made some smart moves on the show, with the bold inscription of \u201cThis is the moment you have been waiting for, Time to put You First\u201d, clearly displayed at the entry of the contestant for the stage performance. This reinforces the bank\u2019s thrust as an inspiration to motivate the talents and youths at large to excellence. It has also promised viewers mouth-watering prizes just by watching the show regularly and following updates on FirstBank verified social media handles.\n\nNow that the Blind auditions stage has come to an end, it is game on! The next phase of the show is the highly anticipated Knockout Stage which starts on May 8. In this stage, the coaches will select the most outstanding talents to proceed to the battles. In this stage, there is so much to come and fans will certainly not be ready for all that is in store.\n\nMore than ever, the show\u2019s fans are hopeful that the knockout stage will even be more entertaining but that will certainly not be a challenge with the dexterity of the handlers so far.\n\nWith all that has been seen so far, it is difficult to believe that this is only the beginning; it is certain that there is so much more to come.",

          "text": "Olakunle Idowu\n\nAn Islamic scholar and Judge of the Shari\u2019ah Court of Appeal, Kwara State, Abdur Raheem Ahmad Sayi, has called on the Federal Government to devise a technology to regulate access to the internet with a view to checking misguided information, particularly those capable of fuelling security and religious crises in the country.\n\nThe cleric who observed that the unfettered access by Nigerians, especially the youth, to the loads of \u201cmisinformation\u201d on the cyber space has contributed immensely to the present security challenges in the country, warned that failure by the government to do the needful might spell doom for the unity of Nigeria.\n\nJustice Sayi made this call in his lecture at the 2012 Special Ramadan Iftar programme, organised by the Ogun State government, held at the Arcade Ground of the Governor\u2019s Office, Oke Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nThe theme of the programme was \u201cThreats to National Security and Unity: Religion as a Panacea or Problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cleric, internet could be educative, entertaining and informative, but promoters of hate and disunity in the country had used it to spread messages of discord and fake news among Nigerians, hence government must find ways to curb the menace before it is too late.\n\nHe noted that the country is atop a keg of gunpowder and if no efforts are made to check the social malaise, things could get out of hand.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhat Nigeria is currently witnessing in terms of insecurity will be a negligible fraction of chaos that will come.\u201d\n\nThe judge urged leaders of Islam and Christianity in the country to desist from preaching about prosperity alone, but inculcate the core values, tenets and teachings of love and unity of mankind, in the minds of their adherents.\n\nHe further charged religious leaders to use religion as instrument to foster unity and oneness, rather than to promote discrimination, hate and disharmony.\n\nHe also urged media practitioners to continue to play a pivotal role in reversing the trend of insecurity by imbibing and practising responsible journalism, which according to him will go a long way in preserving societal peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking, the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, said the special Ramadan Iftar programme was a symbolic one, being the very first to be hosted by his administration.\n\nHe noted that the programme was in appreciation of the fervent prayers, solidarity and support his government has enjoyed from the Muslim community in the last two years.\n\nWhile describing the theme of the Iftar programme as apt and instructive, especially when considering recent challenges to security and unity not only in Nigeria, but around the world in general, Abiodun urged the people, irrespective of their religious persuasion, to always engage only in acts that promote security, peace and unity of Nigeria\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cneither of the two major religions in the country supports banditry, insurgency, kidnapping or rebellion against the State.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that \u201cthe leaders and followers; government and people, have the responsibility towards the security and unity of our nation. Otherwise, our actions and inactions without responsibility towards one another become threat to national security and unity.\u201d\n\nHighlighting steps taken by his administration to restructure and reinvigorate security mechanism in Ogun, Abiodun said that the Security Trust Fund was reconfigured and made private sector led, adding \u201cwe made huge investments in patrol vehicles and communication equipment for our security agencies in the state and initiated regular meeting of the State Security Council that had been in limbo before the inception of our administration.\u201d\n\nHe also said his administration had created initiatives to fully and productively engage the hitherto restive youth via the development of Ogun State Job portal, a database of unemployed or underemployed youth, Anchor Borrowers Scheme and FADAMA GUYS.\n\n\u201cIn my inaugural speech about two years ago, I made a commitment that ours is an administration that will observe all elements of good governance \u2013 that we will be fair, just, equitable, open, transparent, accountable, inclusive and obey the Rule of Law. Two years down the line, I am proud that even our worst critics will readily admit that we are a promise keeping administration with manifest delivery of electoral promises across the state. It is also generally acknowledged that we have been even-handed in our dealings with all parts of the state and the strata, regardless of religious belief, political persuasions and ethnic affiliations.\n\n\u201cAgain, I reiterate that I may have been elected on the platform of a great party, All Progressives Congress (APC, of the Christian faith and from a part of our state, I am and will continue to act as Governor of all good people of Ogun State. This is an element of the tripartite covenant between me and God on one hand, and between me and good people of Ogun State who have entrusted me with the mandate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined the Muslim faithful to take full advantage of the Holy Month, particularly the last ten days, to harvest the bountiful divine benevolence, seek forgiveness and pray for security and unity of the country.",

To claim that I singlehandedly awarded a contract in my capacity as Managing Director, is, therefore, irresponsible, mischievous, and defamatory.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe report also mischievously lumped the now expired service boat contract between the NPA and the Integrated Logistics Services\u2019 (INTELs), which took off in 2007 with a review of a ten-year extension in 2011 to culminate in expiration in August 2020 with the lease under discussion.\n\n\u201cThe service boat contract expired through the effluxion of time and the Authority initiated a procurement process in which INTELs participated in line with all extant laws.\n\n\u201cConcerning Onne berths 9, 10 and 11, which the report alleged was \u201cclandestinely\u201d taken from INTELs; here is the true position:\n\n\u201cThe Authority offered these berths to INTELs in 2013 without any contractual agreement even though the offer letter required that the company should pay rent to the Authority for the use of the berths.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the Authority realised that INTELs had neither been making these payments for five years nor putting the berths to optimal use.\n\n\u201cThe Authority then wrote INTELs to request for the payment of the arrears of monies that were unpaid and expand the utilisation of the facility.\n\n\u201cWith the continued under-utilisation of the facility, the fact that there was no contractual agreement with INTELs from the outset and the urgent need to decongest the ports in Lagos, the Authority offered the berths to an internationally renowned container handling company, Messers International Container Terminal Nigerian Limited (ICTNL) for the use of the berths for container cargo discharging.\n\n\u201cICTNL has signed a contract for the lease of the berths with the Authority and has commenced the installation of container handling equipment when INTELS instituted a court action challenging the withdrawal of the offer. That case is still in court!\n\n\u201cAnd according to reports in the media, ICTNL has refuted allegations that it has connections with Alhaji Aliko Dangote. This exposes another disgraceful fabrication.\n\n\u201cI also note the insinuation of a non-existent monetary transfer between Alhaji Dangote and I during the 2015 elections as i told an online medium when I was approached about this story, no such transaction occurred,\u201d she stated",

          "text": "Nigerians on Twitter have started a #JusticeforOmolara campaign after it was reported that a woman, Omolara Omoyajuwolo, died from suspected overdose of injections from nurses at an Ogun State hospital.\n\nNigerians are recounting instances where the nation\u2019s healthcare system has disappointed them, leading to dashed hopes and loss of lives.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Freestuv1/status/1391279137646649344?s=20\n\nThe hashtag \u2018#JusticeForOmolara\u2019 is trending with over 5,000 tweets.\n\nIt all began when a close friend of the deceased narrated how Omolara who had ulcer, died.\n\nAccording to the narrator, Omolara had complained of peptic ulcer pain and immediately went to the hospital to get treatment. She was tested, injected and treated for malaria.\n\nThe friend said, \u201cMy friend Lara was feeling some type of ulcer attack as she claimed on her phone status and she went to the hospital where she tested positive also for Malaria. According to her, she was given some injections and then she went back home.\n\n\u201cI got to Lara\u2019s place at past 10pm. She had tried to eat and vomited, she was sweating profusely. I started to clean, she vomited again. I went to her neighbour so we could go back to the hospital since she wasn\u2019t getting better, she was breathing hard too.\n\n\u201cWe got to Beachland Hospital, Arepo (Ogun State) and she saw the same doctor that attended to her initially. I excused them but I heard him say \u2018I\u2019ll have to admit you.\u2019 I saw a nurse there giving her some injections through her hands (the way they give drips). Lara was so uncomfortable; she kept on insisting that she couldn\u2019t lie down because she was not breathing well.\n\n\u201cSomehow, Lara lost consciousness, a doctor came in and said she (the new doctor) didn\u2019t know it was this kind of case (meaning it was critical) and then asked that she be placed on oxygen.\n\n\u201cI made efforts myself and at some point I went to the emergency room to get the oxygen myself. I almost lifted it alone before one of the nurses came to give me aid and eventually another collected it from me. She was placed on oxygen.\n\n\u201cAt almost 1am, they said they needed to refer her (to another hospital). They said I needed to get someone to come and pick us up. I approached the first doctor that attended to her as he was writing the referral letter and tried to ask some things, he didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cI thought they would let us go with the oxygen, a nurse only brought it to the car door and put it in Lara\u2019s nostrils for a while, I even thought she was gonna go with us. They left us and told Lara\u2019s neighbour to move with the \u2018highest speed\u2019.\n\nREAD ALSO: How Nigerian soldiers apprehend 10 suspected Boko Haram in Kano Mosque\n\n\u201cThey placed her head on my laps and asked me to raise my laps, the windows were wound down as they advised.\n\nWhen we got to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, the doctors at the medical emergency announced that Lara was dead and they filled a form stating \u2018BID\u2019 (Brought in dead). She died on my laps and in my arms.\u201d\n\nThe friend lamented that she believed Omolara\u2019s health was mismanaged and should be investigated.\n\nShe called on Nigerians to help amplify her case to the appropriate authorities.",

          "title": "Opinion: Legislators\u2019 oversight visit to Sambisa is overdue \u2013 By TONNIE IREDIA",
          "text": "Last Thursday, I was slightly amused listening to Senate President, Ahmed Lawan pouring encomiums on the service chiefs of Nigeria\u2019s military. When the report by the broadcast media on the event started playing, I had thought it was a valedictory session where some war veterans were taking a well-deserved bow.\n\nBut when it became clearer that the day\u2019s celebrants were the General Lucky Irabor led new service chiefs, I had to put off my initial doubt to watch more closely to find that the colourful reception by the Senate for the team was real and that it departed substantially from the old familiar song whose chorus was that no one knows into what use the military had put the huge resources appropriated and allegedly received by them. It was as if the Senate had just discovered how well the funds had been meaningfully utilized. If so, what was the source of the new information?\n\nI mean was it credible evidence obtained from oversight function? I just hope the Senate\u2019s position was not informed by the predictions of any of our vision-seeing members of the clergy! Whatever the source, one thing which is certain, is that no one can blame a television viewer for being cynical; after all, the general narrative on ground has been one of despondence in which the public had been made to believe that funds meant for the military were usually diverted by the top hierarchy leaving nothing for the troops to prosecute the insurgency war. Indeed, when the last service chiefs left office, there were reports of jubilation in military circles especially at the war front which tended to validate the rumour that military funds were truly misappropriated. Although there were official attempts to clarify the statement credited to the National Security Adviser NSA that weapons and equipment that should have been bought were not bought, the general feeling which subsisted was that the funds were missing.\n\nThere was in fact the allegation by the International foundation against corruption that about N10.02 trillion spent on the security sector in Nigeria has had no audit report from 2015 till today. So, why was the Senate President presenting a vote of thanks in favour of the military? Could it be that the legislature suddenly discovered that the military leaders were innocent of all charges against them and that the funds reportedly appropriated for the military never got to them? I found that slightly hard to believe because Zainab Ahmed, our Minister of finance, budget and national planning who should know, had confirmed two days earlier,that all the funds were released.\n\nThe Minister spoke at an interactive session with members of the Senate Committee on the Army.\n\nShe also asserted that apart from funding the budget of the army almost 100 per cent, there had been a lot of instances where the security leaders went to the president, got special approvals and still got the funds. Interestingly, the Chairman of the same committee, Senator Alli Ndume had continuously complained that funds for the Army were not received by the Army.\n\nHow then, can one understand our insurgency fight where the appropriation, delivery and receipt of the resources for the fight are turned into a story of several versions? This confusion would not have arisen if oversight functions are implemented creditably in Nigeria. But painfully they are not. Elsewhere, what touches a nation most is the concern of all; in which case, Nigerians should have been mobilized by government to focus on our current major problem which incidentally concerns the security and welfare of the people.\n\nThe legislature represented by her several committees on the military should have designed a monitoring framework covering when a request is made by the military, when it is approved, when it is dispatched, when it is received and how it is spent. We ought not to have subjected our military to the distraction of spending much time pursuing approved funds. In other words, a team of legislators should have since been stationed in Sambisa by way of symbolically carrying supervision to the very point of assignment as they do, all the time, especially with lucrative agencies such as the NNPC. If that had been done, the new service chiefs would not have, on assumption of duty and indeed before settling in, be called to account for purchases made by their predecessors.\n\nWhy was there no oversight at the appropriate time? Honestly, oversight functions by the legislature have in the last one year dropped significantly. In August 2020, thirty-nine (39) Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) issued a joint statement accusing the National Assembly of not only a drop in her oversight functions but a general lack of commitment to duty. The CSOs arrived at this conclusion after a study of the performance of the lawmakers for the legislative year beginning from June 2019 to July 2020 in which they found that the legislators sat for only 149 days instead of the 181 days prescribed by the constitution.\n\nThis may have been caused by the propensity of the legislators to enjoy several holidays and adjournments. For example, although all other public sector services had only two days declared as public holidays last month for Easter, the legislators were away for the same festivity for three weeks.\n\nThey have in the last three days already begun their own Sallah holidays, yet to be officially declared by government and they are not expected back till May 18th. We, therefore, agree with the CSOs that there ought not to be a drop in legislative activities by the National Assembly at a time when its role has become more critical than ever before, in joining the Executive to find solutions to the unprecedented challenges currently facing the country. We also believe that our legislators should revive their mechanism for their constitutionally approved oversight functions provided, they remove from it, the tendency to commercialize the subject.\n\nThe old order whereby legislators blackmailed some Ministries, Departments and Agencies into settling their travelling costs etc. must be halted. In addition, there is the need for the legislature to always get to the logical end of every investigation. Not many were pleased for instance, with how the allegations made publicly that NDDC contracts were cornered by legislators was swept under the carpet.\n\nThis attitude has always adversely affected public expectations whenever the legislature jumps into every matter as if nothing must go past them without their input. The posture no doubt has a fair share in the failure of Nigeria to have strong institutions. When for example, there is some emergency in any part of the country, and the very next day the legislature passes a resolution \u2018directing\u2019 NEMA to help the victims of the occurrence, it suggests that the entity has no capacity to independently face its mandate.\n\nIt also removes from them, personal initiative and discretion. Such interventions are only rational in cases where the resolution was provoked by transparent lethargy on the part of the relevant societal institution. It is worse when the legislature disrupts the schedule of duties of public bodies through incessant summoning of chief executives who are never allowed in what looks like \u2018a show of ego\u2019 to delegate their appearance. It is particularly offensive when it is done to the military that should be encouraged to completely face the nation\u2019s current difficulty of incessant killings in several parts of the country.

Up till now, it has not been easy. If the case has been concluded we will try and see if we can put a closure to that chapter and we will just mourn her till maybe when I and my wife will die.\n\n\u201cBut the case is still on. I don\u2019t even know when the next hearing will be. My wife is so disturbed because of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you have an open wound that is not healing. If the case is concluded, our minds will be at rest,\u201d he said at an event organised by the Kogi State Government and unveiling of a cinema movie project in Tolulope\u2019s honour.\n\nMr Arotile stressed that if only justice can be served as soon as possible, their minds will be put to rest.\n\n\u201cTo show that you cannot just kill a serving officer, a pilot in the Air Force Base premises and the case is being treated as nobody.\n\n\u201cYou know our normal judicial service system, the case keeps dragging on\u2026that is a problem for us,\u201d Mr Arotile lamented.\n\nThe NAF had earlier in July 2020 released its preliminary report on the death of Tolulope in a car accident at their base in Kaduna.\n\nThe Force in the report revealed that Ms Arotile was killed by her friend who mistakenly hit her with his vehicle.\n\n\u201cUpon recognising their schoolmate, Arotile, after passing her, Mr Adejoh, who was driving, reversed the vehicle, ostensibly in an attempt to quickly meet up with the deceased, who was walking in the opposite direction. In the process, the vehicle struck Flying Officer Arotile from the rear, knocking her down with significant force and causing her to hit her head on the pavement. The vehicle then ran over parts of her body as it veered off the road beyond the kerb and onto the pavement, causing her further injuries,\u201d air force spokesperson, Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement containing the report.\n\nThe air force after the release of the preliminary investigation handed over the suspects Nehemiah Adejoh, Igbekele Folorunsho, and Festus Gbayegun to the at the NAF Base Kaduna.\n\nThe news of Arotile\u2019s death in July 2020 shook the nation, leaving many saddened by her demise at a prime age.\n\nThe NAF later immortalised Arotile in September by naming a Pilot\u2019s Crew Room after her.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nAs leaders and experts continue to propose how Nigeria can overcome the problem of insecurity, a former governor of Enugu State believes state police is not an option.\n\nSenator Chimaroke Nnamani was of the opinion that adopting state police as a solution to the security challenges would be a wrong move because the factors that led to the abolition of regional police were still very much available.\n\n\u201cThat is not the solution. State police will not work in Nigeria,\u201d he said when he featured as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\nHe added, \u201cRemember that we had some form of state police \u2013 regional police, we had an ordinance of 1916 that formerly established regional police. There were factors that led to the abolition of state police.\n\n\u201cAll those factors that led to the abolition of the regional police and formal entry into the central police have not changed. Nigeria is organic, it is one unit and what that means is that if the eye is having a problem, the brain could have a problem.\u201d\n\nAn Unjust System?\n\nThe former governor, however, stated that having state police would only function effectively if it was made to be uniform in all 36 states of the federation.\n\nHe warned that should state police not be in uniform and standardised in all the state, it would amount to what he described as an inherent inequality.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, it is an imbalance to have state police in a state like Lagos where the poverty rate is very low compared to other states with a higher rate of poverty.\n\nOn the way forward, he suggested a conference of ethnic nationalities to help address the imbalance said to have been created by the constitution.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a country of multi-ethnic African nationalities \u2013 those ethnic nationalities are in Nigeria on basis of inequality.\n\n\u201cThe constitutions that have been derived from all these fora are inefficient, unequal, and unjust because those constitutions are results of political machinations of people who got the people to make the constitutions together,\u201d said Nnamani.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat we need is a conference of ethnic nationalities on equal basis. Multi-ethnic nationalities have to conference and produce a system that is equitable, fair, and just.\n\n\u201cThe system, as it is \u2013 the National Assembly, State assemblies\u2026, are inherently unjust because of the way they were derived.\u201d",

          "text": "The death toll in a horrific bombing at a girls\u2019 school in the Afghan capital has soared to 50, many of them pupils between 11 and 15 years old, the Interior Ministry said Sunday.\n\nThe number of wounded in Saturday\u2019s attack has also climbed to more than 100, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian.\n\nThree explosions outside the school entrance struck as students were leaving for the day, he said. The blasts occurred in a mostly Shiite neighborhood in the west of the capital. The Taliban denied responsibility, condemning the attack.\n\nThe first explosion came from a vehicle packed with explosives, followed by two others, said Arian, adding that the casualty figures could still rise.\n\nIn the capital rattled by relentless bombings, Saturday\u2019s attack was among the worst. Criticism has mounted over lack of security and growing fears of even more violence as the U.S. and NATO complete their final military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack targeted Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic Hazaras who dominate the western Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood, where the bombings occurred. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims\n\nThe area has been hit by violence against minority Shiites and most often claimed by the Islamic State affiliate operating in the country. No one has yet claimed Saturday\u2019s bombings.\n\nThe radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan\u2019s Shiites. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nSoon after the bombing, angry crowds attacked ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He had implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.\n\nBloodied backpacks and schools books lay strewn outside the Syed Al-Shahda school. In the morning, boys attend classes in the sprawling school compound and in the afternoon, it\u2019s girls\u2019 turn.\n\nResidents in the area said the explosion was deafening. Naser Rahimi told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, and immediately thought that the sheer power of the blasts meant the death toll would almost certainly climb.\n\nOne of the students fleeing the school recalled the attack, the girls\u2019 screams of the girls, the blood.\n\n\u201cI was with my classmate, we were leaving the school, when suddenly an explosion happened, \u201c said 15-year-old Zahra, whose arm had been broken by a piece of shrapnel.\n\n\u201cTen minutes later there was another explosion and just a couple of minutes later another explosion,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was yelling and there was blood everywhere, and I couldn\u2019t see anything clearly.\u201d Her friend died.\n\nOutside the Muhammad Ali Jinnah Hospital, in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood dozens of people lined up to donate blood, while family members checked casualty posted lists on the walls.\n\nMost of the dozens of injured brought to the EMERGENCY Hospital for war wounded in the Afghan capital, \u201calmost all girls and young women between 12 and 20 years old,\u201d said Marco Puntin, the hospital\u2019s programme coordinator in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a statement following the attack, the EMERGENCY Hospital said the first three months of this year has seen a 21 per cent increase in war-wounded.\n\nIS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.\n\nEven as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.\n\nEarlier the group took responsibility for the targeted killing of three women media personnel in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.\n\nThe top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some \u201cbad possible outcomes\u201d against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.",

          "title": "Kaduna Governor El-Rufai, Benue Counterpart Ortom Trade Words Over Insecurity in Nigeria",
          "text": "The disturbing security situation in Nigeria appears to have turned two governors against each other as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom have thrown caution to the wind, attacking each other over the security situation in the country.\n\nNasir El-Rufai fired the first salvo, ostensibly in support of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he claimed Governor Ortom only uses the insecurity in his state to attack the Buhari-led administration as a way to cover up for his own failure.\n\nBut an obviously agitated Ortom immediately fired back and came down heavily on his Kaduna State counterpart, accusing him of not only misleading President Buhari to gain favours, but also one of the real enemies of the country.\n\nEl-Rufai, who first hit at Ortom while responding to a video, which featured Ortom addressing protesters after some killings in Benue State, during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group, claimed he no longer took his Benue colleague seriously.\n\n\u201cI did not hear what Governor Ortom said (in the video) but I know him and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, El-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating El-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his state several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.",
