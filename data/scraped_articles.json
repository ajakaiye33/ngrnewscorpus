          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Godwin Oritse\n\nTHE immediate past President of Nigeria Maritime Law Association (NMLA), Mr. Chidi Ilogu, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, has made a strong case for the training of young maritime lawyers to enable them acquire proper understanding of admiralty practice.\n\nMr. Ilogu, who is also the Senior Partner of Foundation Chambers, spoke in Lagos on Thursday during the inauguration of the new executives of NMLA. The event also marked the official induction of a new partner of Foundation Chambers, Ms. Kashimana Tsumba, who heads the Shipping, Multi-Modalism and Corporate practice arm of the firm.\n\nIlogu noted that one of the problems facing the maritime industry is lack of good understanding of admiralty practice by lawyers.\n\nREAD ALSO Convene national dialogue to quell agitations for self determination, Igbo leader tells FG\n\nHe said, \u201cWe try to do more in continuing education with the younger ones to help them understand fundamental principles of admiralty practice. One of the problems we have in the industry is that a good number of times, lawyers do not quite have a good understanding of what is involved in admiralty practice and so they make mistakes and do not protect the interest of the clients as effectively as they should. So we organise seminars to help improve the knowledge of our colleagues.\u201d\n\nMr. Ilogu, while expressing appreciation to NMLA members for their support during his tenure, urged them to extend the same support and cooperation to the new executives.\n\nOn the induction of a new partner into Foundation Chamber, Ilogu expressed confidence that the new partner, Ms Kashimana Tsumba, will contribute to building a sustainable team in the Chamber.\n\n\u201cSome of us are not getting any younger. I am over 70 and I do not intend to continue the practice indefinitely. I want to believe that by God\u2019s favour, we should be able to build and allow the newer ones to gradually take over with a view to helping build a more sustainable team in which I don\u2019t necessarily have to be in the forefront,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the newly elected President of NMLA, Mrs. Funke Agbor, promised to push for reforms to curb delays in administering judgments in claims involving arrests of vessels and other cases concerning maritime and shipping development in Nigeria.\n\nAgbor, who expressed concerns over delays in maritime cases in Nigeria, said the reform proposal has already been submitted to the Federal High Court and would soon be forwarded to the National Assembly.\n\nShe said, \u201cOur main concern at the moment is admiralty court, which is the Federal High Court. They have a very big jurisdiction in terms of the subject matter they deal with and admiralty is just one of them. They are very overburdened with the work and admiralty matters are very expensive and intensive in the sense that the vessels on the waters in respect of which the court has jurisdiction are very expensive.\n\n\u201cThe jurisdiction of the court where they are arresting vessels all over the world is done speedily but in Nigeria we find that it takes too long and it is because the courts are overburden and there are not enough judges with the knowledge.\n\n\u201cSo we also want to assist the court by suggesting some reforms to the legislature so that it will make it easier for them to do their work. We want to propose certain reforms that we think will aid their work of both the judiciary and the practitioners and the general people who use the bigger services in the admiralty sector including freight forwarders, ship owners and people who deal with seafarers, among others.\u201d\n\nAgbor also harped on the need for a legislation that will facilitate the prosecution of pirates and the perpetrators of other maritime crimes.\n\n\u201cShipping is international so our decisions are read all over the world. It is critical that our judgments have integrity, verifiable and are fundamentally based on law. These are the things we are hoping to ensure that we are able to do,\u201d she said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ola Ajayi \u2013 Ibadan\n\nA leader of Igbo community in Oyo State, Dr. Alex Anozie has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to convoke a national dialogue to address various agitations for separation by major ethnic groups in Oyo in the country.\n\nHe made the call when speaking with newsmen in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.\n\nIf the FG can take the bold step, he said, all unnecessary tension building up across the country would subside.\n\n\u201dI can assure you that if security and peace is guaranteed again, all those agitations will fizzle out. If all these killings every day, raping of our women, banditry and kidnapping should stop today, most of these agitators will change their minds.\u201d\n\n\u201dEven these agitators, you might be surprised that they love Nigeria more than any other person. But they are forced to do what they are doing because of the impunity going on in the country\u201c, he said.\n\n\u201dI think it is high time the government should humble itself and gather everybody together. What is the way out? No shame there. But, if it continues to flex muscles and say no, I can\u2019t tolerate this, this is my government, things will continue to get worse on daily basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it not better to say my brothers from the East come, my brothers from the West, South and North, come let us talk. If restructuring is the way out, that will bring peace and continuity of the unity of the country, we go for restructuring. If referendum will bring peace, we go for referendum; whatever we can do peacefully to remain united we do it\u201d.\n\n\u201dBut if eventually, some people are insisting they want to go away, instead of killing ourselves, we can sit at a round table and sort things out. After we have sat and we now see that the only way out is for Nigeria to disintegrate, let it be done peacefully. But, that is not my first choice. My first choice is a Nigeria where every tribe in the country lives and property is secured and equity, justice and fairplay will be on the front burner. \u201d\n\n\u201dYou are talking of peace and unity and you see people entering to other people\u2019s land, killing and raping their women and the government that should be protecting them is not doing so any more and you want them to keep quiet and continue to die. And you are shouting peace and unity deceitfully. That is the cause of insecurity in the Southeast. It is reactionary.\u201d\n\n\u201dPeople are trying to defend themselves. Some people can come together and say, let us gang up and protect our people; let us defend our people. They may be unknown. Someone may be tempted to think that all these attacks on security men, collecting of their weapons may be a way for them to gather weapons because whenever they attack or shoot security men, they go away with their weapons\u201d.\n\n\u201d So, it might be a way to gather weapons for their own use. It may be so or it may not be so. So, the insecurity in the Southeast is not something palatable for one to hear and it\u2019s not only in the Southeast, it\u2019s all over the country now. And everybody is worried.\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s not the Nigeria we worked for, this is not the Nigeria we are expecting to see, a country where we all should be living peacefully, with one love and united people\u201d.\n\n\u201d You don\u2019t need to go far to know that this is the cause of agitation in the country. People have seen that there is no more security of lives and property. Or should anybody say there is security in the country, no one should deceive us any longer. We are not happy about the situation in the country. We want to see a peaceful Nigeria, where you can live in any part of the country without bloodshed. A country where people of all tribes, all religions should live peacefully\u201d.\n\n\u201dBut, when you see and hear that foreigners have flooded the country with weapons killing and raping the women and government cannot address the problem. Even, some people might be telling you that government is aware of their presence here, they may be wrong or right. You know, it\u2019s very disturbing, I have never witnessed that since I was born here in Nigeria. I am over 70 years now. We never had it so bad\u201c, he concluded.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Juliet Ebirim\n\nBritish-Nigerian youth advocate, inspirational speaker and political consultant Daniel Ogoloma have bemoaned the gross misplacement of priorities among some Nigerian youths.\n\nDuring his recent visit to Nigeria, the Nigerian political consultant, once again had close interactions and a general observation of the attitude of many Nigerian youths towards important issues that border on their socio-economic and political future. He had firsthand experience of the lukewarm stance being taken by youths over matters that can determine their individual and collective survival.\n\nHe discovered that while some of these regrettably reckless decisions by the youths are taken out of ignorance and exuberance, some of them are actually deliberate acts of pleasurable indulgence.\n\nDuring one of his close encounters with some youths and youth leaders, Ogoloma lamented what he called, \u201cthe lackadaisical attitudes of many youths towards their civil responsibilities and nation-building.\u201d He noted that while a few sections of the youth population is interested in matters of nation-building and are striving to contribute their efforts, the majority of the youths are not only displaying apathy, they are channelling their time, resources and energy into a wide range of unproductive, illicit and even time wasting ventures and activities.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHis words: \u201d Sadly, this misplacement of priorities is not only distracting the youths from the collective goal of building a progressive nation, but it also has costly consequences which are capable of jeopardizing the future of the country if the status quo remains.\u201d\n\nDaniel gave the example of internet engagement by the youths. He agreed that while some young people use the internet for legal, innovative and productive purposes, a large number of them use the same medium to perpetrate illegal activities such as internet fraud, social media trolling and cyberbullying. While he emphasized that he has nothing against fashion and entertainment programmes like musical concerts and reality Tv shows, Ogoloma expressed his concern at the amount of involvement and level of attention invested in these activities by the youths, when compared to their lack of interest in matters like politics, leadership, education, etc.\n\nHe acknowledged the importance of entertainment but urged the youths to show the same level of interest, commitment and expend the same amount of energy given to such entertainment programmes on important socio-political issues.\n\nHe wondered why young people would prefer to attend musical concerts to intellectual fora, spend hours glued to their televisions and spend their resources to vote for housemates, in reality, tv shows but would not come out during elections to vote for qualified and competent leaders or participate actively in nation-building activities. Daniel warned that\u201d The cost of this apathy towards important socio-political issues among the youths might be too grave to bear.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, advised young Nigerians to brace up and redirect their energy positively towards building a better Nigeria for all.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "Why I featured Bobrisky in my movie \u2013Tayo Sobola, actress",
          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nPretty actress, Tayo Sobola popularly known as Sotayo Gaga by fans and colleagues in the movie industry has opened up on reasons she had a secret wedding and why she won\u2019t reveal her husband\u2019s identity.\n\nPictures of you wearing a wedding gown went viral recently, are you truly married?\n\nYes, I am married, but the truth is that it\u2019s not recent; I just decided to post the pictures on social media.\n\nHow come you didn\u2019t reveal your husband\u2019s identity?\n\nIt\u2019s because I wanted to keep my marriage and husband private. I am the star and one who\u2019s popularly known in the movie industry, not my husband. He\u2019s a private person, so there is no point exposing him to the public.\n\nNow that you are married, what should we expect from you?\n\nWell, nothing is changing about me. It\u2019s just that I have decided to spread out a little. I just opened my clothing line, Clean Stitches, but a lot of people still don\u2019t believe I own it; some think I just modeled for the brand. Now, we have opened a new branch in Abuja.\n\nWhy Abuja, is that where marriage has taken you?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not really because of marriage. I have a home here in Lagos; I also have a house in Abuja. And I have always been traversing Lagos and Abuja, and now that it is time to expand my business tentacles, I then thought of Abuja. Aside the fact that we have our clients all over the world, Abuja people patronise us a lot. If you notice my signature, you will realise that I deal with lots of boubou, and iro and buba, which are mostly rocked by classy or funky women. And trust me, Abuja has them plenty. So, I did my research and came to the conclusion that since I have a landed property there, and my shop too, I will have good sales. So, I made up my mind to open another branch in Abuja.\n\nAre you now fully into fashion and no more acting for Sotayo?\n\nNo. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am known in the industry already, so I can always go off and on and remain as if I never left. In life, there\u2019s always time and season\u2026there were times we were after fame, now we are after money.\n\nAre you saying that movies are no longer paying your bills?\n\nNot really, but for now, I want to concentrate on my business. There are some doors that being an actress will open that money might not open. So, both acting and business are paying.\n\nOf recent, one of your colleagues came out to say that she makes millions from acting, that they pay her up to N5 million per role. Could that be true?\n\nAbsolutely yes! Why not? Some (producers) can pay you as much as N10 million to feature in a movie, whereas another producer can pay you as low as N200, 000 for the same role. It all depends on your relationship and how you can sell their movie, and how much they have on ground for the production.\n\nFrom the productions you have done in the past, did you make such money?\n\nSo, you think I will invest in a project that will not profit me? Never! Let me tell you a clear truth, I have never produced a movie without making money in return. I am a businesswoman. How can I put my money down and not make profit from it?\n\nThere was a time you featured popular cross dresser, Bobrisky, in one of your movies, what informed that decision?\n\nIf you know me well, you will know that I don\u2019t discriminate. I have known Bobrisky since he was Idris, and if you watch that movie very well, you will see that I used it to pass a message whereby his \u2018younger sister\u2019 was manhandled because of the way he was trying to attract men to himself, and at end of it all, he gave up on that particular habit.\n\nHow and where did you meet your husband?\n\nOne thing people don\u2019t know is that I have been with my husband for over seven to eight years now.\n\nSo, you have been married that long?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get me wrong. We have only been married for a couple of months.\n\nWhere did both of you meet?\n\nLet me give you that as an assignment to find out. Thank you.\n\nBetween compact disc and Netflix, which one do you think brings more profit to the industry?\n\nBoth have their advantages and disadvantages. For the elite, who hardly watch television and can easily access any movie of their choice on their smart phones, they will go for Netflix, YouTube and the rest. For the typical trader, who hardly uses smartphones, they can\u2019t ever rule out compact disc or DVD as we may call it. If I should reason as a business owner, I will go for DVD, but civilization is timeless\u2026everyday we move with new trends.\n\nWould you say your clothing line has changed your dress sense to wearing boubou, iro and buba and abaya kind of clothes?\n\nI can slay iro and buba to the White House. I am someone who likes my comfort, although my mood most times dictates my dressing. But I will choose boubou and iro and buba over any other outfits anytime.\n\nRecently, the Nigerian music industry witnessed a turnaround when Wizkid and Burna Boy won the Grammys, do you think Nollywood movies too can win Oscar?\n\nWhy not? There\u2019s nothing that can never happen. You know, the way white people think is not the way we reason. Recently, Davido featured in Hollywood film, Coming To America 2, so who knows what the next move could be.\n\nWhat do you have to say about Yoruba movies shot with low budget and English movies with high budget and their production quality?\n\nTruly speaking, that\u2019s not the yardstick to determine a low or high budget movie. I can shoot with millions of naira and still have a very bad quality production, while some shoot with hundreds of thousands and get a very good quality job. And I can spend a month on location and still not come up with something good, while some people will spend few days or weeks and come out with a good job. So, all those things don\u2019t determine a good job at all.\n\nSo, no more movie roles for Tayo; it\u2019s all about Clean Stitches now?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get it twisted; you might see me in politics anytime soon.",

          "title": "2023: Why Nigerians should shun APC, PDP \u2013 Sani, ADP chairman",
          "text": "From Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nNational Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Dr Yagbaji Sani, has said that rotational presidency, otherwise known as zoning, has not provided the needed economic development for the country, rather it has broadened the gap of division and nepotism.\n\nHe, therefore, suggested in this interview that political parties should always throw the contest open so that those with the needed administrative acumen would not be disenfranchised because of where they come from.\n\nThe former presidential candidate also joined the clamour for the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, sequel to his utterances on insurgency in the past.\n\nHe maintained that the spate of killings and kidnapping perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents is a by-products of Pantami\u2019s teachings.\n\nHe, however, backed the Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Mahmud Gumi, for facilitating negotiations with bandits and parents of kidnapped children, adding that he has not done anything wrong.\n\nHe also encouraged political leaders to judiciously utilise resources in their possession to create employment, build schools, hospitals and roads, in order to keep the youth busy. Except:\n\nWhat is your take on the spate of insecurity in the country?\n\nIf truth must be told, I believe it is the consequences of leadership failure. Because when there is leadership failure, definitely, you will see that even the most basic things that should be taken care of will not be addressed properly. Because when you look at democracy or any form of government at all, in fact, even in constitution, the two fundamental responsibilities of the government is the issue of security and the welfare of the people. That is what the constitution says. Any government that cannot provide the two things for its citizens has no moral rights to expect respect from the citizens. And if care is not taken it might even get to a revolt; the people may rebel against you because you have not been able to take care of the basic requirements. So, I believe that why what is happening is happening is because we have leadership failure. Period.\n\nWhile the PDP is pushing for a summit to discuss the way forward on insecurity, the APC is not seeing the need for such a meeting. How do we address the problem?\n\nBoth the APC and PDP are one and the same. It is six and half a dozen. That is what it is. You see, when you look at APC and you throw back your attention and recollect what happened during the PDP era, it is just a re-enactment of what happened during the PDP era only that this time around it is more endemic. There seems to be a total collapse of the situation today. We are just afraid that the whole thing will collapse under the PDP. But PDP was not better than what we are seeing under APC. Under PDP, Boko Haram insurgents were even coming to Abuja attacking people, and exploding everywhere. People were afraid just like what we have now. People were not free to move around. But the case we have today is worse; which means that the situation has been degrading from the PDP time till now. So, it is like a case of a kettle calling the pot black. There is nothing that the PDP is accusing the APC today that it did not do. There was leadership failure under the PDP too. And what we are running away is for Nigeria to run away from the situation we have found ourselves today. So, the issue is that Nigerians must start to think and look away from these two parties. Nigeria is bigger than PDP and APC because we transcend those parties. Nigeria does not start and end with APC and PDP. And, when you look at it, the same people that were in PDP in which we were having the problem are the same people today that are in APC. So, it is not as if outside these people you do not have Nigerians that can take care of this country. The situation we have in this country is that Nigerians do not want to rise to the occasion themselves. We must begin to see the futility of continuing to support these two parties in government because they do not have what Nigeria needs. And what Nigeria needs today are people who have this country at heart and have the competence and capability to deliver this 21st Century economy that we have which is a promise of greatness. There is nothing that we need in this economy to make it great that is not there. What is lacking is leadership. What is lacking is the fact that our process of the recruitment of leadership is still at that stage of people manipulating the levers of power and rigging elections to bring in people that cannot deliver. So, if you have your process of recruitment of leadership as corrupt as it is, there is no way you can dream of having people that would live up to expectations or be ready to give this country the kind of leadership that it deserves. So, this is why we are just in a vicious cycle. And both the APC and PDP, believing in me, everybody in this country knows that they are one and the same. It is the same bad dream that we had during the last administration that we are having today. Nigerians never thought that we will be where we are in this country today. Why because we have competent people. We have the resources. We have the statute as a nation which is respected across the globe. That is why anywhere you go Nigerians are respected because they know what you are worth; in terms of resources, leadership and capacity. So, when you talk about PDP or APC, believing in me, it is those that what you can call failure of our circumstances. We just found ourselves in almost a failed state. Look at what happened during Jonathan, the international community had come to rescue Nigeria. It is because Nigeria was almost failing as a nation. Today, we are in a worse situation that we need to be rescued that is why some people are saying that we should look for foreign assistance. It is because Nigeria was almost failing. The political class you have today that are in charge of the affairs of this country have failed. The truth is that they do not have what Nigeria needs so they cannot give that leadership. That is why people should look at the direction of ADP. God knows why he put parties like ours in this country today. It is to rescue this country. There is nothing we will do today that will give this country the kind of progress, peace and unity that are required under another APC or PDP government. It will never happen. Because when they come in instead of concentrating on building the nation they will just be talking about things that are not relevant. The issue is that we have come to the stage where another set of people should be allowed to run the affairs of this country. We can do it. It has been proven that things cannot change unless we the followership change. And change is an option. If it is a situation where we do not have an option that would be a different thing entirely. So, the blame game is all because we do not want to change. So, the press has a lot to do here. The press can make this country work by ensuring that it changes the narrative. It should not be about PDP and APC. Nigerians should begin to understand that there is an option or alternative that is more credible that can give this country a leadership that would provide new path to progress, prosperity, unity and pragmatic leadership that will unleash this huge potential that we have as a country. Everybody knows that we are a country that is of promise of greatness by everything that we need to have. Look at the leadership we have today that is not even engaged with the people. As bad as the situation is you should have a kind of interaction with your people. But that is not happening. Money is given out and nobody is accounting for it even for the insecurity you are talking about. Billions of naira have been given to this people, nobody is telling us what happened to those monies, how it was spent. If it was their own money, none of them would allow things like this to happen; that you spent billions and there is nothing to show for it. There is evidence of arms purchased, no money in the account and to the extent that they are even asking for more money. They want to be given more budget to fight this war as if we are people that have saw-dust in our brains. We need to break from this rigmarole and the narrative of PDP and APC. We still have two years to go. It can be done. The press can lead. Every country where meaningful change happened, it is the press that leads the way.\n\nDo you also subscribe to the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, following his utterances on insurgency?\n\nI have told you about leadership failure. Where you have leadership, government will not wait for this thing to happen whether wrong of right. The man is not denying what he said or didn\u2019t say. He did. So, the issue is that government, particularly the president, should realise the fact that he was elected by the people of this country and he swore by the Quran that he was going to protect the interest of this country; that he was going to exert fear or favour. So, when you have discovered that in one reason or the other you have a minister in your cabinet that has been accused of most of the things that are happening today in terms of insecurity, whether remotely or anyhow you want to look it, at least, to demonstrate to the nation that he is representing them and that he is living up to his responsibility, this man should be eased out because he did not deny it. Why are we having the problem we are having today? It is because of people that had, or still have those kind of mentality, and their ideology is not in tune with the modern way of doing things. He said he did, but he is recanting that he is not in that kind of belief anymore. But, we are suffering from the by-products. That is what snowballed into what we are having today. It is those people that you taught, those radical thinking that are still in the bush. Even though you have now said that you have renowned that ideology, we are still suffering from the damage in this country. Because that is why we still have the likes of Boko Haram people that are thinking differently. Yes, he has apologised. If the country wants, it can forgive him or allow the law to take its course. But, the right thing to be done is for the government to relief him of his duties and responsibilities, and then let him understand that what he did, the country is still suffering from it. In other climes, if you are in government of a high school, and they discovered that you raped a girl or smoked marijuana, you would be in trouble. There was a judge of a Supreme Court that was supposed to be appointed in America, you can see the extent they went because a woman came out and said the man took advantage of her in a high school. It became an issue. So, it is not enough to come out and apologise. He should not be allowed to continue in office in all fairness given the circumstances we are in today, and given the fact that we cannot divorce those radical ideologies we are having today. So, he is responsible.\n\nAre you comfortable with the role being played by Sheikh Gumi in negotiating with bandits?\n\nUnder this circumstance or the situation we are in, it is the right thing to do. Do you know why? The government has denied people money they are supposed to use to build hospitals, schools and roads. They come to Abuja, collect the money, sit down in a room and divide the money among themselves, thinking that the people are stupid or they do not know what is happening. If they are using the billions collected from the federation account to build schools, hospitals and good roads you would not have bandits. If some have jobs and leave their houses at 8:00a.m to go to work, would they have time to go into the bush? That is why they are taking it by force. So, under this scenario, it is right. Let them sit up. Let them stop stealing. Let them use the money to create employment and not to buy houses in Dubai or Europe and always going for vacation. They have exhausted all the civil ways of doing things, that is why they are in the bush. Gumi is right. When Buhari came to power he said 70 per cent of the budget is being stolen. But what did he do about it? And you want the people to just fold their hands and be watching you?\n\nThough we still have two years to the next general election, there has been this agitation for the Southeast to produce the next president. What is your take?\n\nI do not like to indulge in what I call a very high intelligent way of looking at issues in the country. The problem we have in this country transcends zoning. They are more serious than where the president of Nigeria should come from. Why are we where we are today? It is because of the issue of zoning. You can take it from the Jonathan\u2019s time to now. It is just because they did not allow the best material to emerge as the president of this country; it was always handpicked. It has always taken religious dimension as if when it comes to the issues of the country the person can do better. We should wake up and begin to think about this country as a serious business. If in your private business you start bringing in sentiments like employing your brothers even when they are not competent, what would happen to the business? Definitely, it will fail. For God sake, let us be serious. The position of the president requires more than what we are attributing to it. I look at it as lazy and people who are not serious in their way of thinking. In social club you can do that, but when it comes to the issue of president, we should have a checklist as a nation. We should look at track records and performances that will matter. This is doable. The leaders of thoughts are there to do it. The press is there. It can set the agenda and change the narrative. Look at where we are today. We are a laughing stock simply because there is a leadership failure and because we did not do the right thing. If zoning is working, why are people in Katsina being killed like chicken? Why is the whole North on fire? The business of running the country is a very serious business. It is not about this man is a Yoruba man, or Hausa man or an Igbo man. Let us begin to look at tract records. If you look at countries that have gone passed us like Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, most of them jettisoned the idea of where a person is coming from. Because when you do that you have completely disjointed the whole issue of running the country from what it should be to what has no relevance in the governance itself. And that is why we are always failing.\n\nWhat is the prospect of ADP in the next general election?\n\nIt is very bright. Do not mind the ballooning of membership they are telling people. Believe me, by the time the two parties will explode you will see what will happen. We believe that the ADP has a very unique opportunity in 2023 because Nigerians will wake up. And sane people who have the country at heart will look for a party like ADP to begin to build Nigeria and not themselves or tribes because that is what we represent. We are the Noah\u2019s Ark that will take the country to the Promised Land.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nDetermined in stopping bandits from infiltrating Abuja, security forces have commenced massive deployment of personnel and equipment to all entry and exit points of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThis is coming barely 24 hours after Daily Sun exclusively reported that the military high command had approved a massive deployment of special forces to fringe towns and villages where bandits are believed to be taking refuge.\n\nSunday Sun investigation revealed that security operatives have also commenced raid on major spots in Kogi, Niger and Nasarawa states just as they have commenced demolition and raids on all known criminal hideouts within and around the FCT.\n\nThe security agencies made up of a joint task force are also said to be raiding major motor parks, uncompleted buildings, markets, mechanic workshops and villages, where criminals and bandits are believed to be hiding.\n\nIt was gathered that following the alarm raised by residents of Bwari, a satellite town in the FCT, the military in conjunction with security agencies swung into action.\n\nThe military, Sunday Sun gathered, is on red alert to counter any terrorists invasion. The Forward Operation Bases (FOB) is also combing the forests within Keffi, Niger and Kogi states, where some of the terrorists were said to have set up their camps. The camps have been demolished.\n\nA security source who does not want to be mentioned told Sunday Sun that the security agencies are also clamping down on illegal drug sellers, especially the hawkers, as it has been discovered that they have direct contacts with the criminals.\n\nThe source identified Maraba, Masaka, Nyanya Motor park, Kugbo, Kubwa, Dutse, Apo, Gwagwalada, Gwagwa, Mpape, Asokoro village, Garki village, Jabi motor park, Utako market, Nyanya market, Zuba, Suleja, Abuja/Keffi road, Lugbe, Kuje, Orozo, Kado, among others as some of the identified spots in Abuja.\n\nThe Guards Brigade, which is saddled with the primary assignment of providing security for the president, his immediate family, VIPs, the FCT and the surrounding states, has deployed enough manpower and equipment to give any criminal group that may want to cause trouble heat, it was gathered.\n\nThe Army Headquarters Garrison is also said to have deployed its men, especially in plain clothes, to some of these places to checkmate activities of criminals.\n\nThe source told Sunday Sun that the military cannot afford to allow criminals, especially bandits and terrorists, into the FCT.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI can tell you that we are on red alert. We know there is tension over terrorists\u2019 invasion of the FCT after the Niger State governor raised the alarm that the terrorists would soon come here. We know they would come and we are ready for them. Already, our men are all over the place to battle these men. Abuja is the last place we will allow them to come and carry out their atrocities.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that prior to the alarm raised by the Niger State governor, over possible invasion of the FCT, bandits had taken over some FCT villages, kidnapping innocent villagers, including traditional rulers, security operatives on a regular basis and collecting ransom from their relatives.\n\nRecently, bandits invaded an orphanage home and abducted over eight orphans. The police said they were carrying out a covert operation to rescue the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, following social media reports that kidnappers had infiltrated the nation\u2019s capital, the FCT Police Commissioner, Bala Ciroma, in a statement assured that the FCT was not under attack by terrorists, urging the residents not to panic, as the police have put all security measures in place to protect lives and property.\n\nBut despite the assurances, activities of criminals have continued to thrive in the FCT.\n\nCiroma in a statement signed by the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, said: \u201cThe attention of the FCT Joint Security Team has been drawn to a viral publication in the social media purporting that the \u2018Federal Capital Territory is under the attack of Boko Haram terrorists\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Security Team of the FCT wishes to refute the mischievous publication targeted at creating palpable tension amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT. Contrary to the speculation, the Heads of Security Agencies (HOSA) in the Federal Capital Territory in the bid to address security concerns within the FCT, held a strategic meeting on Thursday 29th April, 2021, where the team resolved to deploy alternative proactive crime-fighting measures within the FCT particularly in areas with challenging terrain including aggressive motorized/foot patrols.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, more schools have shutdown in Abuja, following threats by bandits to attack and abduct students. The mass closure of schools kicked off on Wednesday. On Thursday and Friday, more schools sent their students home.\n\nGovernment schools are not left out, despite repeated assurances by the FCT administration that the schools were safe. The worst hit areas are Bwari, Kuje, Kwali and Abaji.",
          "summary": "Sunday Sun investigation revealed that security operatives have also commenced raid on major spots in Kogi, Niger and Nasarawa states just as they have commenced demolition and raids on all known criminal hideouts within and around the FCT.\nIt was gathered that following the alarm raised by residents of Bwari, a satellite town in the FCT, the military in conjunction with security agencies swung into action.\nThe Forward Operation Bases (FOB) is also combing the forests within Keffi, Niger and Kogi states, where some of the terrorists were said to have set up their camps.\nThe source told Sunday Sun that the military cannot afford to allow criminals, especially bandits and terrorists, into the FCT.\nGovernment schools are not left out, despite repeated assurances by the FCT administration that the schools were safe.",

The apex court then held that the tenure of the sacked council chairmen, elected in 2018 had expired, and ordered the state government to pay all salaries and allowances of the sacked chairmen from May 2019 to March 2022, apart from awarding a cost of N20million against the government as damages.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe could not be part of the preparation for that election at the initial stage because we felt the dissolution of democratically-elected chairmen and councillors was illegal. Now that we have been vindicated, it is thus right for the government to give a level playing field in order for us to test our popularity.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, the former ALGON chairman, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye, who was a former chairman of Oluyole local government, expressed appreciation to all those who contributed to the victory at the apex court.

          "text": "\u2022Debates frequent students\u2019 abductions, boko haram attacks\n\nBayo Akinloye\n\nWorried about the nation\u2019s unceasing insecurity, the United Kingdom\u2019s parliament, the House of Commons, has held consistent debates between April 12 and 22 over the continued abductions of students and the sustained attacks by Boko Haream\u2019s insurgents.\n\nThe lawmakers debate, THISDAY understood, centred around understanding the situation in Nigeriaand subsequently providing assistance to her government.\n\nFor example, on April 12, lawmaker Jim Shannon, the Democratic Unionist Party MP for Strangford, sought to find out what discussions the UK government had had with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration on helping to prevent the kidnap of children from schools.\n\nIn response, James Duddridge, the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the kidnapping and continued captivity of schoolchildren by Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in North-East Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe British High Commission continues to raise these cases with the Nigerian government, most recently in March 2021. We are also concerned by the recent attacks on schools in Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, and Katsina states, conducted by criminal groups.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cI publicly condemned these attacks and stressed the importance of all children being able to access an education without fear. The UK Deputy National Security Advisor discussed the abduction of Nigerian schoolboys in Kankara in Katsina State with the president\u2019s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, on December 15, 2020.\n\n\u201cOur High Commissioner in Abuja spoke to the Inspector General of the Nigerian Police on improving school safety and addressing kidnapping in March 2021.\u201d\n\nDuddridge explained that the UK provided mentoring and capacity building for units of the Nigerian Police Force to improve their anti-kidnap capacity and response to organised crime groups in Nigeria.\n\nThe following week, on April 19, another UK lawmaker, Stephen Doughty, the Labour (Co-op) MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, demanded from the British government an assessment of the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East following recent attacks and the displacement of people in the Damasak area.\n\nDuddgride explained that the UK government was concerned by the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East, where terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa, continue to attack local communities.\n\nShedding more light on his assessment, he noted, \u201cRecent attacks on Damasak in Borno State, in which civilians, humanitarian workers, and facilities were targeted, have led to a worsening humanitarian situation, and the displacement of local residents and internally displaced people to Niger or other areas of north-east Nigeria. As the UK government has repeatedly made clear, humanitarian workers should never be a target.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated to the House of Commons that the UK remained \u201ccommitted to helping Nigeria tackle the threat posed by the terrorist groups\u201d in the North-East, adding, \u201cWe are providing significant humanitarian and stabilisation assistance to support affected communities, including those who have been displaced.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s findings also showed that 60 to 69 UK-based staff were posted by the then Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development and currently Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office to all posts in Nigeria as of March 31, 2021.\n\nOn April 20, another legislator Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, asked specifically about the threat to Christians amid killings in Nigeria.\n\nIn response, Duddridge stated that the UK condemned all violence against civilians in Nigeria, irrespective of religion. He pointed out that in the North-East, terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWA, \u201ccontinue to cause immense suffering to both Muslim and Christian\u201d communities.\n\n\u201cThese groups seek to undermine the right to freedom of religion or belief by indiscriminately attacking those of all faiths, who do not subscribe to their extremist views,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further told the House of Commons that intercommunal violence across multiple states also \u201chas a devastating impact\u201d on Christian and Muslim communities and disclosed that the \u201cunderlying drivers of violence are complex, and frequently relate to competition over resources and increasing criminality.\u201d\n\nOn April 26 and 27 April, the UK minister disclosed that he met with \u201ca range of Nigerian interlocutors, including governors\u201d from some northern states and Nigerian government representatives, including the foreign affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama.\n\n\u201cI raised the need for all communities to be protected amidst increasing insecurity\u2026We will continue to encourage the Nigerian government to take urgent action to protect all communities and to implement long-term solutions that address the root causes of violence,\u201d he told the parliament.\n\nThe UK envoy also told the House of Commons about the issues of LGBT in Nigeria, noting that the UK government is worried about the criminalisation of homosexuality, recognising that there is a long way to go before all LGBT people can live free and equal lives in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking of the country and others in Africa, Duddridge explained, \u201cWe make regular representations to governments around the world on this issue, including in Uganda, Ghana, Namibia and Nigeria. We work through our Embassies and High Commissions, as well as international organisations, including the UN, Council of Europe, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Commonwealth, to promote non-discrimination towards LGBT people, and to address discriminatory laws.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe directly challenge governments that criminalise homosexuality at the highest political levels.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Kaduna Gov: Ortom attacks the president to hide his failure\n\n\u2022Benue Gov: El-Rufai is misleading Buhari and has divided Kaduna\n\nGeorge Okoh in Makurdi\n\nThe disturbing security situation in the country appears to have turned two governors against each other as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom have thrown caution to the wind, attacking each other over the security situation in the country.\n\nNasir el-Rufai fired the first salvo, ostensibly in support of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he claimed Governor Ortom only uses the insecurity in his state to attack the Buhari-led administration as a way to cover up for his own failure.\n\nBut an obviously agitated Ortom immediately fired back and came down heavily on his Kaduna State counterpart, accusing him of not only misleading President Buhari to gain favours, but also one of the real enemies of the country.\n\nEl-Rufai, who first hit at Ortom while responding to a video, which featured Ortom addressing protesters after some killings in Benue State, during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group, claimed he no longer took his Benue colleague seriously.\n\n\u201cI did not hear what Governor Ortom said (in the video) but I know him and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, el-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating E-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his State several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Eyes N30 billion in second quarter\n\nObinna Chima\n\nDespite the decline in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) last year due mainly to the effects of COVID-19, Ogun State Government raked in N21 billion in the first quarter of this year. Governor Dapo Abiodun disclosed this in a statement on Friday, saying the state has perfected plans to generate over N100 billion in 2021.\n\nAbiodun spoke at a special Iftar (breaking of fast) with members of the House of Representatives, House of Assembly, State Executive Council, and the Body of Permanent Secretaries. He stressed that his administration was committed to putting the state on a strong financial and economic footing through creative governance.\n\nThe governor said the dip in the state\u2019s IGR in 2020 was due to drop in earnings from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE), tax incentives given to industries in the state, and lack of revenue from the education sector.\n\nHe said the target for the second quarter of 2021 was N30 billion.\n\nAbiodun stated, \u201cOur IGR dipped in 2020 and there are some reasons for that \u2013 there was no Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for us during the COVID-19 period, we gave incentives to industries because they couldn\u2019t work during that period, and because we are the education capital of the country, a lot of our IGR was coming from the tertiary institutions and because there were no students in schools, the revenue did not come in.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what the good news is, the good news is that first quarter of 2021, we already got N21 billion.\n\n\u201cLast year, we did N58 billion, so we\u2019ve already gotten half of what we got last year in one quarter. This present quarter, we will do at least N30 billion, and by the end of this year, by the grace of God, we will do over N100 billion in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration discovered that Land Use Charge was not being paid in the state, stressing that it inherited a database of 14,000 people from the previous administration. He said the discovery led his administration to put in place mechanisms, which had helped the state to realise a database of Land Use Charge for over 1.5 million people. \u201cThis will translate into a lot for our administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nAbiodun stated that his administration would soon launch Ogun State Land Administration and Management System (OLAS) to help residents of the state who had built on government property to come and regularise their papers.\n\n\u201cThat system using ICT, we are going to ensure that all those that have built, we are starting with government owned property alone, all those that have built on government property will have to come and regularise their papers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are not talking about those that built on any other land, we are talking of government land alone, so we bring them in to regularise their papers.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the state of the nation and the intended reversal of the new minimum wage by some states, the governor said his administration, being one of the first to sign the minimum wage into law, was committed to the continuous payment of the new wage to its workforce.\n\nHe stated, \u201cNot only did we implement it, my colleagues are now reversing the minimum wage because they can\u2019t pay it. Some of my colleagues have even asked me if I am sure I can keep on paying the minimum wage, I told them that Ogun State is not like other states, that in Ogun State, we have to keep on paying the wage.\n\n\u201cSo, I am committing to the very excellent public service that I have that I will continue to pay the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nAbiodun urged members of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), to democratically put their best candidates forward at the forthcoming local government elections in the state. He assured that everything would be done in consonance with the principles of democracy.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the deputy governor, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, commended the governor for his quality leadership, saying this is behind the giant strides of his administration in the last two years.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe share of United States dollar reserves held by central banks across the world fell to 59 per cent\u2014its lowest level in 25 years, during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThis is according to the just-released International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) survey.\n\nSome analysts claimed this partly reflected the declining role of the US dollar in the global economy, in the face of competition from other currencies used by central banks for international transactions.\n\nIf the shifts in central bank reserves were large enough, they could affect currency and bond markets.\n\nThe dollar acts as the primary reserve currency for the global economy, and foreign exchange reserves in central banks around the world account for the bulk of the US dollar.\n\nAccording to the survey, the share of US dollar assets in central bank reserves dropped by 12 percentage points\u2014from 71 to 59 per cent\u2014since the euro was launched in 1999, although with notable fluctuations in-between.\n\nIt noted that the share of the euro has fluctuated around 20 per cent, while the share of other currencies including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Chinese renminbi climbed to 9 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe value of the US dollar has been broadly unchanged, while the US dollar\u2019s share of global reserves has declined, indicating that central banks have indeed been shifting gradually away from the US dollar.\n\nSome expected that the US dollar share of global reserves would continue to fall as emerging market and developing economy central banks sought further diversification of the currency composition of their reserves.\n\nA few countries, such as Russia, have already announced their intention to do so.\n\nBut despite major structural shifts in the international monetary system over the past six decades, the US dollar has remained the dominant international reserve currency. Any changes to the US dollar\u2019s status are likely to emerge in the long run, the survey noted.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had on April 27, 2018, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria signed a Currency Swap Agreement with the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) on behalf of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe swap deal, an agreement with a three-year tenor, allows both the CBN and PBoC to swap a maximum amount of 15 billion Renminbi/Chinese Yuan (CNY 15 billion) for N720 billion.\n\nThis amount is equivalent to $2.5 billion using the prevailing exchange rate of N305:$1 at the time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Centres to have between 750 and 1000 voters\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere are indications that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may approve up to 176,996 polling centres across the 36 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as part of the ongoing expansion and verification of polling centres ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nBut the adjustments of the lower and upper thresholds for voting points, according to INEC, would be from 750 and 1000, to 500 and 750.\n\nThe implication is that INEC would be creating additional 57,023 polling units nationwide, although the breakdown is not known yet.\n\nA memo dated April 20, 2021 was said to have backed the development. The document with reference number INEC/DE/No:72/2021 and titled: \u201cDecision Extraction on the Amendment of the Threshold for the Conversion of Voting Points to Polling Units,\u201d reads in part: \u201cThe Commission at its meeting held on Tuesday, April 20, 2021, deliberated on the above subject and approved as follows: The adjustment of the lower and upper thresholds for Voting Points from 750 and 1000 to 500 and 750, respectively\n\n\u201cThat the ICT and Electoral Operations Departments and the state and local government area offices of the Commission should adopt these new thresholds in implementing the ongoing programme of expanding voting access to Polling Units.\n\n\u201cYou may wish to refer the extract to all Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) and Directors for information and necessary action, please.\u201d\n\nMaryam Iya Musa, a director at the Commission, signed the memo.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye, had earlier told THISDAY that the commission planned to create new polling units from the existing 119,973 polling centres. Okoye said INEC would create additional 57,023 polling units, to make the proposed 176,996 polling centres\n\nThis is coming 25 years after the defunct National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) created the existing polling units, which INEC has been using.\n\nUnder the new polling centres, units would have between 500 and 750 voters.\n\nPutting all elements into consideration, INEC, THISDAY gathered, had settled for the application of 500 lower limit and 750 upper limit.\n\nUnder the former INEC leadership, headed by Professor Attahiru Jega, the commission planned the creation of 30,000 polling units. In the new polling centres before it was rejected, northern states had over 21,000 while the entire South got a little above 8,000.\n\nVoting point platform, as widely known and accepted by stakeholders, was based on lower and upper thresholds of 750 and 1,000 registered voters, respectively.\n\nBut, as at press time, the commission was yet to give a breakdown of state-by-state or zone-by-zone of the polling centres.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

See Also Politics God Should Kill Children, Wives Of Elders Who Don't Support Yoruba Nation\u2014 Sunday Igboho Tackles Pastor Adeboye Over Son's Death\n\nWhen asked for his opinion about Igboho\u2019s comment, Pastor Oladeji said, \u201cI am sorry. No comment. If that is how you all see it, let it be. If CAN has been keeping quiet over the happenings in the country, if that is how you see it, too bad. We are not ready to reply Sunday Igboho.\u201d\n\nIgboho in the interview did not mince words when he hurled curses at leaders or pastors who refuse to support the secession agenda, saying God would kill their children and wives.\n\nHe said this during a live Facebook broadcast with his media aide, Olayomi Koiki, on Saturday night.\n\nKoiki had asked the activist to send some words to Adeboye through the live video, to sympathise with him over the death of his son.\n\nBut, Sunday Igboho appeared infuriated by Koiki\u2019s request as he asked if the man of God had declared his support for Yoruba nation.\n\nHe said, \u201cHas Baba supported Yoruba nation that we will now be greeting him? We don\u2019t need to greet Adeboye. What is my own with that? We are not doing church here. This is not religion.\n\n\u201cPastor Adeboye didn\u2019t speak about Yoruba nation. Look at the number of crowd in Baba Adeboye\u2019s church. Is he not supposed to tell all of them to join Yoruba nation? We don\u2019t need to greet him.\u201d",

          "text": "Unilever Nigeria Plc posted a strong gain in sales revenue in the first quarter ended March 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s turnover was elevated by roughly 46 percent during the quarter, staging a major rebound from a flat growth at the end of the prior financial year.\n\nSales have been upward bound for the company since the second half of last year. There was an outstanding growth of over 94 percent in sales revenue in the third quarter and 84 percent advance quarter-on-quarter in the final quarter of 2020.\n\nRecovering sales revenue presents a strong positive signal for Unilever Nigeria this year. Sustaining high growth in sales raises hopes for a possible return to profit in the course of the financial year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s management appears to be on the right track in addressing the critical factor in its operating challenges in recent years \u2013 which is a significant loss of sales revenue.\n\nThe company generated sales revenue of over N19 billion for the first quarter operations at the end of March. This represents an increase of some 46 percent compared to a flat turnover at the end of the 2020 full year.\n\nRevenue gains in the second half of last year enabled the company to cut its loss for the year from N4 billion in 2019 to N1.6 billion. Further gains in turnover is therefore promising for further cut in the loss figure, even a possible return to profit in the current financial year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gains in sales in the first quarter were recorded in the company\u2019s two broad market segments of food products and home/personal care products. Home/personal care product segment led the growth by more than 52 percent to N9 billion in the first quarter, marking a rebound from a drop of 7 percent at the end of last year.\n\nAlso, an increase of 9 percent in the company\u2019s Food products segment last year has accelerated to over 40 percent to N10.4 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe growth in sales revenue turned out to be insufficient to cover cost increases and build profit for shareholders in the first quarter. First quarter operations closed at a loss of N491 million, which marks the third straight year that Unilever Nigeria has traded in the red.\n\nWith recovering sales and a 4th quarter profit in 2020, it had been expected that this year\u2019s trading would open at a profit for Unilever Nigeria in the first quarter. However the cost moderation expected to bring this about could not be realised during the period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, costs grew generally ahead of revenue so that the improvement in sales was insufficient to absorb all the cost increases. Input expenses posed a major challenge over the period by growing ahead of sales revenue. From a drop of 12 percent at the end of last year, cost of sales rose by as much as 51 percent to close at N15 billion at the end of March.\n\nThe high growth in cost of sales consumed an increased share of revenue and therefore eroded gross profit in the first quarter. The expenses claimed 77 percent of turnover in the first quarter compared to 74 percent in the same period last year.\n\nThe company still recorded an increase of over 30 percent in gross profit to N4.5 billion for the first quarter but gross profit margin dived from 26 percent to 23 percent over the review period.\n\nThe leading cost increase came from selling/distribution expenses, which rose by 63 percent to N3.8 billion from a 2 percent decline at the end of last year. There was also an increase of 36 percent in impairment loss on receivables \u2013 whichadded to the upsurge in selling/distribution expenses. The cost increases threw operating results into a loss of N165 million at the end of the first quarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA drop of 62 percent in finance income added to the company\u2019s constraints during the review period. Finance income is down for the second year after a 48 percent drop in 2020.\n\nUnilever closed the first quarter operations with a net finance income of N152 million and a pre-tax loss of N13 million. Tax expenses built up the net loss to N491 million at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe company posted a loss of 9 kobo per share for the first quarter against earnings per share of 26 kobo in the same period last year. The prospects for returning to profit this year depends on whether it can add cost moderation to improving revenue.",

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust. And there is no better source in Nigeria (today) like Meat247 powered by Livestock247.com\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nGet your story featured on Techpoint.

We have been in touch with the police headquarters and agreed that Edo State Government will intervene in upgrading and improving the training facility and make it available for training the policemen and other members of the security architecture in the State.\n\n\u201cWe are redesigning the security architecture for the state and it will enable us to have a permanent training facility for about five or six squads at a time, made up of fifty men in each squad.\n\n\u201cThey will be equipped with introductory training in security, intermediate and advanced training as well in different levels. It can\u2019t happen with the facility in a state of disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come in to do an evaluation and assessment ourselves. The clinic needs to be rehabilitated and re-equipped and the hostels need to be rebuilt and re-equipped for decent habitation.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state. I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "text": "Olakunle Idowu\n\nAn Islamic scholar and Judge of the Shari\u2019ah Court of Appeal, Kwara State, Abdur Raheem Ahmad Sayi, has called on the Federal Government to devise a technology to regulate access to the internet with a view to checking misguided information, particularly those capable of fuelling security and religious crises in the country.\n\nThe cleric who observed that the unfettered access by Nigerians, especially the youth, to the loads of \u201cmisinformation\u201d on the cyber space has contributed immensely to the present security challenges in the country, warned that failure by the government to do the needful might spell doom for the unity of Nigeria.\n\nJustice Sayi made this call in his lecture at the 2012 Special Ramadan Iftar programme, organised by the Ogun State government, held at the Arcade Ground of the Governor\u2019s Office, Oke Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nThe theme of the programme was \u201cThreats to National Security and Unity: Religion as a Panacea or Problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cleric, internet could be educative, entertaining and informative, but promoters of hate and disunity in the country had used it to spread messages of discord and fake news among Nigerians, hence government must find ways to curb the menace before it is too late.\n\nHe noted that the country is atop a keg of gunpowder and if no efforts are made to check the social malaise, things could get out of hand.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhat Nigeria is currently witnessing in terms of insecurity will be a negligible fraction of chaos that will come.\u201d\n\nThe judge urged leaders of Islam and Christianity in the country to desist from preaching about prosperity alone, but inculcate the core values, tenets and teachings of love and unity of mankind, in the minds of their adherents.\n\nHe further charged religious leaders to use religion as instrument to foster unity and oneness, rather than to promote discrimination, hate and disharmony.\n\nHe also urged media practitioners to continue to play a pivotal role in reversing the trend of insecurity by imbibing and practising responsible journalism, which according to him will go a long way in preserving societal peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking, the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, said the special Ramadan Iftar programme was a symbolic one, being the very first to be hosted by his administration.\n\nHe noted that the programme was in appreciation of the fervent prayers, solidarity and support his government has enjoyed from the Muslim community in the last two years.\n\nWhile describing the theme of the Iftar programme as apt and instructive, especially when considering recent challenges to security and unity not only in Nigeria, but around the world in general, Abiodun urged the people, irrespective of their religious persuasion, to always engage only in acts that promote security, peace and unity of Nigeria\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cneither of the two major religions in the country supports banditry, insurgency, kidnapping or rebellion against the State.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that \u201cthe leaders and followers; government and people, have the responsibility towards the security and unity of our nation. Otherwise, our actions and inactions without responsibility towards one another become threat to national security and unity.\u201d\n\nHighlighting steps taken by his administration to restructure and reinvigorate security mechanism in Ogun, Abiodun said that the Security Trust Fund was reconfigured and made private sector led, adding \u201cwe made huge investments in patrol vehicles and communication equipment for our security agencies in the state and initiated regular meeting of the State Security Council that had been in limbo before the inception of our administration.\u201d\n\nHe also said his administration had created initiatives to fully and productively engage the hitherto restive youth via the development of Ogun State Job portal, a database of unemployed or underemployed youth, Anchor Borrowers Scheme and FADAMA GUYS.\n\n\u201cIn my inaugural speech about two years ago, I made a commitment that ours is an administration that will observe all elements of good governance \u2013 that we will be fair, just, equitable, open, transparent, accountable, inclusive and obey the Rule of Law. Two years down the line, I am proud that even our worst critics will readily admit that we are a promise keeping administration with manifest delivery of electoral promises across the state. It is also generally acknowledged that we have been even-handed in our dealings with all parts of the state and the strata, regardless of religious belief, political persuasions and ethnic affiliations.\n\n\u201cAgain, I reiterate that I may have been elected on the platform of a great party, All Progressives Congress (APC, of the Christian faith and from a part of our state, I am and will continue to act as Governor of all good people of Ogun State. This is an element of the tripartite covenant between me and God on one hand, and between me and good people of Ogun State who have entrusted me with the mandate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined the Muslim faithful to take full advantage of the Holy Month, particularly the last ten days, to harvest the bountiful divine benevolence, seek forgiveness and pray for security and unity of the country.",

          "text": "Nigerians on Twitter have started a #JusticeforOmolara campaign after it was reported that a woman, Omolara Omoyajuwolo, died from suspected overdose of injections from nurses at an Ogun State hospital.\n\nNigerians are recounting instances where the nation\u2019s healthcare system has disappointed them, leading to dashed hopes and loss of lives.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Freestuv1/status/1391279137646649344?s=20\n\nThe hashtag \u2018#JusticeForOmolara\u2019 is trending with over 5,000 tweets.\n\nIt all began when a close friend of the deceased narrated how Omolara who had ulcer, died.\n\nAccording to the narrator, Omolara had complained of peptic ulcer pain and immediately went to the hospital to get treatment. She was tested, injected and treated for malaria.\n\nThe friend said, \u201cMy friend Lara was feeling some type of ulcer attack as she claimed on her phone status and she went to the hospital where she tested positive also for Malaria. According to her, she was given some injections and then she went back home.\n\n\u201cI got to Lara\u2019s place at past 10pm. She had tried to eat and vomited, she was sweating profusely. I started to clean, she vomited again. I went to her neighbour so we could go back to the hospital since she wasn\u2019t getting better, she was breathing hard too.\n\n\u201cWe got to Beachland Hospital, Arepo (Ogun State) and she saw the same doctor that attended to her initially. I excused them but I heard him say \u2018I\u2019ll have to admit you.\u2019 I saw a nurse there giving her some injections through her hands (the way they give drips). Lara was so uncomfortable; she kept on insisting that she couldn\u2019t lie down because she was not breathing well.\n\n\u201cSomehow, Lara lost consciousness, a doctor came in and said she (the new doctor) didn\u2019t know it was this kind of case (meaning it was critical) and then asked that she be placed on oxygen.\n\n\u201cI made efforts myself and at some point I went to the emergency room to get the oxygen myself. I almost lifted it alone before one of the nurses came to give me aid and eventually another collected it from me. She was placed on oxygen.\n\n\u201cAt almost 1am, they said they needed to refer her (to another hospital). They said I needed to get someone to come and pick us up. I approached the first doctor that attended to her as he was writing the referral letter and tried to ask some things, he didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cI thought they would let us go with the oxygen, a nurse only brought it to the car door and put it in Lara\u2019s nostrils for a while, I even thought she was gonna go with us. They left us and told Lara\u2019s neighbour to move with the \u2018highest speed\u2019.\n\nREAD ALSO: How Nigerian soldiers apprehend 10 suspected Boko Haram in Kano Mosque\n\n\u201cThey placed her head on my laps and asked me to raise my laps, the windows were wound down as they advised.\n\nWhen we got to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, the doctors at the medical emergency announced that Lara was dead and they filled a form stating \u2018BID\u2019 (Brought in dead). She died on my laps and in my arms.\u201d\n\nThe friend lamented that she believed Omolara\u2019s health was mismanaged and should be investigated.\n\nShe called on Nigerians to help amplify her case to the appropriate authorities.",

He was sacked in August of 2019 following allegations of\n\ncorruption in NDDC under his leadership.\n\nSources at the NDDC conversant with the deal told Pointblanknews.com that Mrs. Amaechi had through her Non for profit organization, Empowerment Support Initiatives, ESI, received a N70billion contract from the agency to train Niger Deltans in skills such as Tailoring, Soap making, Carpentry and others.\n\nAfter the award of contract to ESI, sources told Pointblanknews.com that Mrs Amaechi\u2019s wife received N48billion.\n\nMrs. Amaechi\u2019s ESI said it trained of over 2000 women and youths drawn from the twenty-there LGAs of RIVERS STATE and non-indigenes in COLD PROCCES SOAP MAKING, trained 100 women drawn from the 23 LGAs RIVERS STATE in elaborate fashion Designing in the following areas: Patterns and cuttings, Sewing, Finishing, Fashion &Designing, Colours, Packing, General Management of Business.\n\nOther training ESI claimed was done includes: Elaborate skills Training programme in Fashion Designing Facilitated by a renowned Fashion Designer, Ade Bakare Couture for the following artisans in the fashion industry: Sewing and tailoring, Hat Making & Millinery, Bead Making, Fashion Illustration, Fashion Modelling.\n\nMrs Amaechi\u2019s ESI was a major contractor with the NDDC and she used Brambaifa who was nominated for the acting MD position in NDDC by her husband to collect several contracts running into billions most of which were never done, a source at the agency told pointblanknews.com.\n\nWhile one source said the N48billion was paid to ESI in split payment of N4billion monthly, another source at the Finance Department of the NDDC told pointblanknews.com that the N48billion was paid in installment payment of N4billion weekly.\n\nA report of the scandalous contract has now been tabled before theAttorney General and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami, who in turn is alleged to have used it to threaten the Transport Minister.\n\nAmaechi and Governor Ahmed Elrufai of Kaduna state are both eyeing the Presidency and Vice Presidency in 2023. They belong to a rival group in\n\nthe All Progressive Congress, APC, that is opposed to the Malami group.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ogun govt vows to wield big stick against illegal developers in the state\n\nSources told Pointblanknews.com that the report of the N48billion contract from the NDDC is now being used to silence Amaechi and torpedoed his ambition.\n\n\u201cAmaechi now runs to Tunde, Buhari\u2019s PA to help him lobby Malami so his wife is not prosecuted.\n\nThis is why Amaechi no longer talks tough or says anything to his supporters about 2023 or his ambition.

          "title": "ICYMI: Catholic bishops write Buhari, say coup plot propaganda [Letter]",
          "text": "In case you missed it, the open letter of Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria to President Muhammadu Buhari, on the state of insecurity in Nigeria, is hereby reprinted by P.M.News.\n\nTitled Urgent call to the Federal Government to be open to criticism in addressing the pervading insecurity in Nigeria, the letter was signed by Augustine Akubeze, archbishop of Benin City, who doubles as the President, Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria.\n\nIn the letter, the bishops advised Buhari not to waste his time focusing on the allegation that some religious and political leaders are plotting a coup.\n\n\u201cWhile we reject any call for the destabilisation of Nigeria or military takeover, we nonetheless say to the Federal Government of Nigeria, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, there is no need to focus your energy, time and resources in any form of propaganda against religious leaders who disagree with your performance\u201d, the bishops said.\n\nThey advised that government should rather focus on keeping the citizens safe and suggested the need for a security summit.\n\nRead the full letter\n\nOn behalf of Catholic Bishops of Nigeria ,I greet all Nigerians. at home and in the diaspora. Thank you all for your patience regarding the expectations of rapid development promised by various democratic governments.\n\nSince we returned to democratic rule on 29 May 1999 after several failed military dictatorship, many Nigerians who experienced the brutality of the military are aware that a return to such days is not the prayer or desire of Nigerians.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Nigeria, through the leadership of the CBCN, has spoken several times about the need for us to ensure that our democracy works for every Nigerian and not for only a few privileged politicians or those connected to them.\n\nWe have, like other Nigerians, seen broken promises made by political leaders. The members of the CBCN, like other religious leaders, have spoken against what we -considered Government failure concerning the constitutional obligation to protect the lives and properties of Nigerians; to work for the welfare of everyone, to protect freedom of religious expression; to protect everyone against discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds or any other forms of discrimination. All these are entrenched in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nEvery Nigerian is a stakeholder in the affairs of the country. Every Nigerian has the right to express themselves in a manner that does not incite people to violence or chaos whenever they perceive that the elected Government is failing. A Nigerian does not need to be a registered political party card-carrying member before speaking about the failing economy, the daily killings and kidnappings of students, older men and women; babies and infants; people being killed in IDP camps and even in their homes by insurgents.\n\nEvery reasonable Nigerian is sick to the stomach to read or hear of a Governor running from insurgents who want to kill him in the State where he is constitutionally the chief security officer. Nigerians are tired of hearing of bandits taking youths in the University and executing some of them, while others are kept to be used to bargain for ransom. The insecurity is leading to a daily loss of lives and properties in every part of the country. These facts are indisputable. A country where students are no longer safe in schools nor farmers safe in their farms does not have a future to look to.\n\nEvery reasonable Nigerian is sick to the stomach to read or hear of a Governor running from insurgents who want to kill him in the State where he is constitutionally the chief security officer. Nigerians are tired of hearing of bandits taking youths in the University and executing some of them, while others are kept to be used to bargain for ransom.\n\nIn the midst of all these, the Presidency recently stated that some religious leaders and some Nigerian politicians are plotting to destabilise the country. The spokesperson for the Nigeria Army noted that there is no plan by the military to take over democratically elected persons. While we reject any call for the destabilisation of Nigeria or military takeover, we nonetheless say to the Federal Government of Nigeria, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, there is no need to focus your energy, time and resources in any form of propaganda against religious leaders who disagree with your performance.\n\nThere is no need to spend so much of your time trying to blackmail anyone who criticises your Government. We speak out because we do not want Nigeria to collapse. We are not speaking out for the APC Government to fail. We are speaking out so that Nigeria will not fail. APC is not the owner of Nigeria; Nigeria is owned by Nigerians irrespective of political affiliation. APC Government must learn to listen to every Nigerian, both political actors in other parties and non-political actors in Nigeria and the diaspora. It is not out of place to call for a security summit in whatever form it may take as long as it leads to the unity, peace, justice, progress and protection of Nigerians.\n\nThe Federal Government must be transparent with every Nigerian in the struggle to revive our economy, industrialise the nation, objectively deal with corruption and significantly reduce the high level of insecurity and unemployment.\n\nIn every democracy, the welfare of the citizens is of great concern to the President. From time to time, Presidents address the people and give an account of the state of affairs in the country. Presidents of countries grant interviews to the media who are the watchdogs of democracy. But in Nigeria, we hardly hear directly from our President. Most of the time, we hear from \u201cthe Presidency.\u201d Nigerians did not elect presidential media spokespersons.\n\nNigerians do want to hear directly from their President and hear words that are matched with actions.\n\nTo every religious leader, let us not use inflammatory words that distort the real message we are sending to this Government. We must be united in the fight for our common destiny as a people. It must be clearly stated to the Federal Government that if they continue to ignore the constructive criticisms and recommendations of Nigerians from every sector, the country will collapse and become ungovernable. We are speedily getting there. Police stations are being burnt, our gallant military men and women are being killed, barracks are attacked, IDP camps are attacked, farmlands are invaded, youth unemployment is at its highest, private sectors are not giving enabling environment to thrive, and appointments to offices are not reflective of our diversities; the complaints are almost endless \u2013 could the sounds signalling a collapsing nation be louder than this?\n\nIn Nigeria, the Catholic Church wants the Federal Government to call for a meeting of all stakeholders to have a sincere discussion on the way forward. Such discussions must seek how to implement the much talked about restructuring and devolution of power down to the local government level.\n\nLet us continue to pray to God to grant the Federal Government and other State actors the wisdom and courage to bring peace and justice to every Nigerian. No Government leader should watch the breakdown of law and order in Nigeria. It is our collective obligation to make Nigeria successful. As religious people, we entrust Nigeria to the hands of God and pray that we may respond to the voice of God calling us out of this crisis.\n\nMay God bless Nigeria and keep her safe. Amen.\n\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n\nAugustine Akubeze,\n\nArchbishop of Benin City\n\nPresident, Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria",

          "text": "By Nimot Adetola Sulaimon\n\nYoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, (aka Sunday Igboho) has mocked Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, over the sudden death of his son, Pastor Dare Adeboye.\n\nSunday Igboho said he would not sympathize with Adeboye over the demise of Dare because the General Overseer does not support the Yoruba nation.\n\nIgboho did not mince words when he rained curses on any leader or Pastor who refuses to support the secession agenda, saying God will kill their children and wives.\n\nHe said this during a live Facebook broadcast with his media aide, Olayomi Koiki, on Saturday night.\n\nKoiki had asked the activist to send some words to Adeboye through the live video, to sympathise with him over the death of his son.\n\nBut Igboho appeared infuriated by Koiki\u2019s request as he asked if the man of God had declared his support for the Yoruba nation.\n\n\u201cHas Baba supported the Yoruba nation that we will now be greeting him? We don\u2019t need to greet Adeboye. What is my own with that? We are not doing church here. This is not religion.\n\n\u201cPastor Adeboye didn\u2019t speak about the Yoruba nation.

Up till now, it has not been easy. If the case has been concluded we will try and see if we can put a closure to that chapter and we will just mourn her till maybe when I and my wife will die.\n\n\u201cBut the case is still on. I don\u2019t even know when the next hearing will be. My wife is so disturbed because of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you have an open wound that is not healing. If the case is concluded, our minds will be at rest,\u201d he said at an event organised by the Kogi State Government and unveiling of a cinema movie project in Tolulope\u2019s honour.\n\nMr Arotile stressed that if only justice can be served as soon as possible, their minds will be put to rest.\n\n\u201cTo show that you cannot just kill a serving officer, a pilot in the Air Force Base premises and the case is being treated as nobody.\n\n\u201cYou know our normal judicial service system, the case keeps dragging on\u2026that is a problem for us,\u201d Mr Arotile lamented.\n\nThe NAF had earlier in July 2020 released its preliminary report on the death of Tolulope in a car accident at their base in Kaduna.\n\nThe Force in the report revealed that Ms Arotile was killed by her friend who mistakenly hit her with his vehicle.\n\n\u201cUpon recognising their schoolmate, Arotile, after passing her, Mr Adejoh, who was driving, reversed the vehicle, ostensibly in an attempt to quickly meet up with the deceased, who was walking in the opposite direction. In the process, the vehicle struck Flying Officer Arotile from the rear, knocking her down with significant force and causing her to hit her head on the pavement. The vehicle then ran over parts of her body as it veered off the road beyond the kerb and onto the pavement, causing her further injuries,\u201d air force spokesperson, Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement containing the report.\n\nThe air force after the release of the preliminary investigation handed over the suspects Nehemiah Adejoh, Igbekele Folorunsho, and Festus Gbayegun to the at the NAF Base Kaduna.\n\nThe news of Arotile\u2019s death in July 2020 shook the nation, leaving many saddened by her demise at a prime age.\n\nThe NAF later immortalised Arotile in September by naming a Pilot\u2019s Crew Room after her.",

          "text": "Bayern Munich already have their eyes on a decade of Bundesliga dominance after winning the league title for the ninth successive season on Saturday, celebrating their success with a 6-0 thrashing of Borussia Moenchengladbach.\n\nRobert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick to leave him on 39 league goals this season \u2014 one short of Gerd Mueller\u2019s all-time Bundesliga record \u2014 as the champions swept Gladbach aside at the Allianz Arena.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to show on the pitch that we are German champions,\u201d said Lewandowski, who will \u201ckeep stepping on the gas\u201d in chasing Mueller\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cToday was a great game, we played really well and scored a lot of goals.\u201d\n\nThe emphatic victory leaves Bayern 10 points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig, whose 3-2 loss at Borussia Dortmund sealed Bayern the title, with two games left.\n\nThe players learned they were champions again while still warming up following Dortmund\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cIt was a bizarre situation. We were just getting ready, when we realised that we were champions,\u201d said Bayern captain Manuel Neuer.\n\nBoard member Oliver Kahn has alread challenged Bayern to secure a 10th title in a row.\n\n\u201cWe watched the Leipzig game together, the atmosphere was great,\u201d said Kahn. \u201cYou don\u2019t get used to it, it\u2019s an incredible achievement.\n\n\u201cNow we can do something next season that no team in the world has ever done: become champions 10 times in a row.\u201d\n\nThe only blot on a near-perfect night for Bayern was a red card for Tanguy Nianzou for a clumsy tackle 15 minutes from time.\n\nBayern wasted no time in hitting their stride, Lewandowski finding the bottom corner of the net with just under two minutes gone.\n\nKingsley Coman struck the post before Jamal Musiala\u2019s pass picked out Thomas Mueller to slot in his 11th league goal of the season, then Lewandowski volleyed home his second on 34 minutes.\n\nKingsley Coman made it 4-0 before the break, then won a penalty which Lewandowski converted in the 66th minute to leave him one goal short of Gerd Mueller\u2019s historic mark, before Leroy Sane added a late sixth.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann, the 33-year-old coach who will leave Leipzig to replace Flick at Bayern next season, offered a terse \u201ccongratulations on a deserved title\u201d to his future employers.\n\n\u2013 Sancho double \u2013\n\nEarlier, England winger Jadon Sancho netted twice as Dortmund\u2019s win lifted them into the Champions League places, but Eintracht Frankfurt can retake fourth spot if they beat Mainz on Sunday.\n\nEven without injured striker Erling Braut Haaland, Dortmund were 2-0 up early in the second half thanks to goals from Marco Reus and Sancho.\n\nLeipzig fought back through a Lukas Klostermann header and Dani Olmo\u2019s equaliser, only for Sancho to grab the winner.\n\nThe two clubs meet again on Thursday in the German Cup final at Berlin\u2019s Olympic Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe showed a lot of morale, the game had absolutely nothing to do with the final in Berlin, but of course we want to win on Thursday too,\u201d said Reus.\n\nDortmund hope to have Haaland back from a thigh problem before the final, and even with their top-scorer watching from the stands, the hosts still raced into the lead after less than seven minutes.\n\nReus span out of Lukasz Piszczek\u2019s pass, sprinted behind the defence and took a beautiful back-heeled ball from Thorgan Hazard before sweeping his shot past Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.\n\nDortmund goalkeeper Marwin Hitz did not come out for the second half after being injured colliding with his centre-back Manuel Akanji just before the break and was replaced by Roman Buerki.\n\nDortmund doubled their lead just six minutes after the interval with a superb piece of skill from Sancho, who cut inside after a Raphael Guerreiro pass and fired in off the far post.\n\nThe visitors pulled a goal back on 63 minutes when Emil Forsberg floated in a corner and Klostermann steered his header past Buerki.\n\nLeipzig drew level when South Korea striker Hwang Hee-chan broke clear of Dortmund defender Mats Hummels and squared for Olmo who tapped home from close range.\n\nHowever, Sancho snatched all three points when he flicked the ball to Guerreiro, took a return pass and slotted in to hand Bayern the title.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The death toll in a horrific bombing at a girls\u2019 school in the Afghan capital has soared to 50, many of them pupils between 11 and 15 years old, the Interior Ministry said Sunday.\n\nThe number of wounded in Saturday\u2019s attack has also climbed to more than 100, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian.\n\nThree explosions outside the school entrance struck as students were leaving for the day, he said. The blasts occurred in a mostly Shiite neighborhood in the west of the capital. The Taliban denied responsibility, condemning the attack.\n\nThe first explosion came from a vehicle packed with explosives, followed by two others, said Arian, adding that the casualty figures could still rise.\n\nIn the capital rattled by relentless bombings, Saturday\u2019s attack was among the worst. Criticism has mounted over lack of security and growing fears of even more violence as the U.S. and NATO complete their final military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack targeted Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic Hazaras who dominate the western Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood, where the bombings occurred. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims\n\nThe area has been hit by violence against minority Shiites and most often claimed by the Islamic State affiliate operating in the country. No one has yet claimed Saturday\u2019s bombings.\n\nThe radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan\u2019s Shiites. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nSoon after the bombing, angry crowds attacked ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He had implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.\n\nBloodied backpacks and schools books lay strewn outside the Syed Al-Shahda school. In the morning, boys attend classes in the sprawling school compound and in the afternoon, it\u2019s girls\u2019 turn.\n\nResidents in the area said the explosion was deafening. Naser Rahimi told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, and immediately thought that the sheer power of the blasts meant the death toll would almost certainly climb.\n\nOne of the students fleeing the school recalled the attack, the girls\u2019 screams of the girls, the blood.\n\n\u201cI was with my classmate, we were leaving the school, when suddenly an explosion happened, \u201c said 15-year-old Zahra, whose arm had been broken by a piece of shrapnel.\n\n\u201cTen minutes later there was another explosion and just a couple of minutes later another explosion,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was yelling and there was blood everywhere, and I couldn\u2019t see anything clearly.\u201d Her friend died.\n\nOutside the Muhammad Ali Jinnah Hospital, in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood dozens of people lined up to donate blood, while family members checked casualty posted lists on the walls.\n\nMost of the dozens of injured brought to the EMERGENCY Hospital for war wounded in the Afghan capital, \u201calmost all girls and young women between 12 and 20 years old,\u201d said Marco Puntin, the hospital\u2019s programme coordinator in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a statement following the attack, the EMERGENCY Hospital said the first three months of this year has seen a 21 per cent increase in war-wounded.\n\nIS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.\n\nEven as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.\n\nEarlier the group took responsibility for the targeted killing of three women media personnel in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.\n\nThe top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some \u201cbad possible outcomes\u201d against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.",

          "text": "The disturbing security situation in Nigeria appears to have turned two governors against each other as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom have thrown caution to the wind, attacking each other over the security situation in the country.\n\nNasir El-Rufai fired the first salvo, ostensibly in support of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he claimed Governor Ortom only uses the insecurity in his state to attack the Buhari-led administration as a way to cover up for his own failure.\n\nBut an obviously agitated Ortom immediately fired back and came down heavily on his Kaduna State counterpart, accusing him of not only misleading President Buhari to gain favours, but also one of the real enemies of the country.\n\nEl-Rufai, who first hit at Ortom while responding to a video, which featured Ortom addressing protesters after some killings in Benue State, during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group, claimed he no longer took his Benue colleague seriously.\n\n\u201cI did not hear what Governor Ortom said (in the video) but I know him and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, El-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating El-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his state several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.",
