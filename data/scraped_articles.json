I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that it was satisfying to see Christians breaking fast and, in some cases, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithful during the Ramadan fast.\n\n\u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities. These are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d added.\n\nThe President also urged Nigerians to keep observing all COVID-19 prevention measures and celebrate responsibly.",

          "title": "Better service conditions for health workers\u2019ll stop poaching \u2014FG",
          "text": "The Federal Government has restated its resolve to improve the conditions of service of Nigerian health workers in order to retain their services within the country.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige said this on Tuesday after a meeting between the Presidential Committee on Salaries, relevant stakeholders, health sector professional associations and trade unions on the Issue of hazard allowance and retirement age for health sector workers in government health establishments.\n\nBriefing journalists on the outcome of the meeting, held at the Presidential Villa banquet hall in Abuja, Ngige said they made progress and ironed out issues on the permanent hazard allowance and retirement age for doctors and other health workers.\n\nAccording to him, part of the measures to retain the health workers is giving them better conditions of service, including the increase in hazard allowance and their retirement age.\n\nNgige said, \u201cWe have taken their proposal. The government side will firm up its own proposal and we are reconvening June 1 so that we can have an agreed hazard allowance for health workers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe also discussed the issue of retirement age for health workers, being that we want to keep our health workers here in Nigeria. A lot of people are coming here to poach and take away people we have trained at very great cost. It takes a lot of fund to train a medical doctor, nurse or even a laboratory technologist or physiotherapist. So, we want to retain them here.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the health professionals could be retained for a longer time by increasing their retirement age to 65 for regular health workers and doctors, and 70 years for consultants.\n\nThe minister said in principle, the government agreed to the proposal of the health workers and to put up the necessary machinery in motion for its actualisation.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is something that will not happen in one day. It has to go from the Council on Establishments to Federal Executive Council and the National Assembly, being something that needs legislation. We are making progress. The health workers are happy and we, in the government side are happy also. We need them to keep our health system alive.\n\n\u201cNobody in government is opposed to the proposal. It is a proposal that is realistic. It is a proposal that we all agreed to last year when COVID-19 erupted. Remember that we were even calling back people who are retired. We delayed retirement age by six months for health workers so that we can fight COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is not yet over. Who knows what will happen tomorrow. We are not praying for any other pandemic but we have to be battle ready at all times health-wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have of course done a lot of stock up. We have rehabilitated a lot of health facilities and they are now in top form. We have molecular laboratories all over the place. Every state has one. We have isolation centres, Intensive Care Units, oxygen plants all over the place and good storage facilities for drugs and vaccines and a lot of research is going on too in the area of pharmacy and allied biochemistry. The pandemic also has its bad sides but it has also woken up Nigeria from slumber in its health sector.\u201d\n\nThe President of Nigeria Medical Association, Prof Emmanuel Ujah and his counterpart in the Joint Health Sector Unions, Josiah Biobelemoye, expressed optimism that they would reach an agreement capable of giving Nigerians quality healthcare services.\n\nOthers at the meeting included the Minister of Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, the Director General of Budget Office, Dr Ben Akubueze, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Abdulaziz Mashi and his Labour and Employment counterpart, Peter Tarfa.",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy James Ogunnaike, Abeokuta\n\nAs the much anticipated local government elections in Ogun State gather momentum, Chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC), Mr. Babatunde Osibodu has assured the people of the state that the Commission will not compromise its integrity.\n\nSpeaking in Abeokuta, the OGSIEC boss said members of the Commission are people of impeccable character, whose integrity will reflect in the conduct of the Council polls, assuring that the outcome will be a true reflection of the wishes of the people.\n\nOsibodu said, \u201cI want to once again assure the good people of Ogun State that our firm resolve to organise a council poll that will be totally devoid of any form of manipulation or interference cannot be overemphasized. Our motivation for taking this task is service to Ogun State and to contribute our quota in deepening the democratic values in Ogun and Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur loyalty is to the constitution, Ogun State Electoral Law, and to the good people of Ogun State. The forthcoming elections will be one- man, one- vote, there is no external force anywhere that will influence us. Our motivation for accepting this task is service to the people and nothing more\u201d, he clarified.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is made of people of integrity, who had for decades, proven their mettle across different strata of human endeavours. We are also following the law and due process and this we will hold very dearly in the course of the forthcoming local government elections in Ogun State\u201d, he noted.\n\nMr Osibodu noted that over 10,000 ad hoc staff would be engaged by the Commission, urging those interested to keep monitoring the media for updates, saying that the application would be done online.\n\n\u201cWe shall be engaging the services of more than 10,000 ad hoc staff for the forthcoming local government elections in Ogun State who will serve as Electoral Officers, Presiding Officers and Poll Officers, among others. This is in our drive to make the process seamless and free of hitches\u201d, he stated.\n\nHe explained that the Commission was not involved in the expansion of polling Units, Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), stating that such power resides only with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the National Assembly is expected to give legislative backing to the polling units expansion.\n\nWhile dissociating OGSIEC from a fake timetable that was on social media a few weeks ago, he advised the electorates and general public to be wary of content from the social media, disclosing that any information that emanates from the Commission will be communicated through the appropriate means involving pressmen.\n\n\u201cWe will not be distracted in our poise to deliver a credible election. We work with our timing and the provisions of the law. Whatever does not emanate from us should be totally disregarded\u201d, Osibodu added.\n\nOn the actual days of notification of election, the Chairman revealed that the 90 days duration popularly held in some quarters was exclusive to INEC, just as he stated that the Ogun State Electoral Law, 2007 stipulates not less than 30 days notice of election but the Commission extended it to 85 days.\n\nHe posited further that \u201cthe Commission is empowered by the Ogun State Electoral Law, 2007 to prescribe a non-refundable deposit from male aspirants, who have scaled the primaries, reiterating that the reason for giving female aspirants waivers was to encourage women participation in politics and provide a level playing ground.\n\nHe said the number of political parties participating in the local government elections would be determined after the various primaries, while urging them to be guided by the rules, as OGSIEC will monitor all party primaries, emphasising that only parties can obtain the form for qualified candidates and not individuals.\n\nThe OGSIEC boss allayed the fear of violence during the election, saying, the Commission has been interfacing with the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), and other security agencies in order to ensure the security of lives and property.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

The buses are expected to serve as an alternative means to get into streets that cannot be readily accessed by the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system.\n\n4. The \u2018last mile buses\u2019 will ply inner roads and safely get commercial passengers to their final destinations.\n\n5. The state will be deploying over 500 of these buses to alleviate the pain associated with the restriction of motorcycle and tricycle operations in its first phase.\n\n6. The introductory of this initiative will also generate employment opportunities for Lagosians, including the commercial motorcyclist operators, who will be employed as operators of the \u2018last mile\u2019 buses.\n\n7. The state will keep rolling out the \u2018last mile\u2019 buses till about 5,000 of them are spread within the state.\n\n8. The introduction of the \u2018last mile\u2019 buses is part of the measures taken by the state government against the security breaches and menace of Okada riders, kidnapping, armed robbery, cult clashes and violent assaults in the state.\n\n9. This initiative is aimed at curbing haughty display of lawlessness and criminality within the state.\n\n10. This initiative is also aimed at curbing incessant accidents as the Lagos police boss said Okada accounted for 83% of cases of avoidable fatal vehicular accidents in Lagos between January and early this month.",

          "title": "Disquiet in NAMA over secret recruitments",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nThere is a massive air of suspense in the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) over the recent shortlisting of about 35 candidates to be trained and recruited as Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) with insiders alleging that majority of the shortlisted candidates were from northern part of the country and almost 18 allegedly from Katsina State.\n\nDaily Sun exclusively learnt that the recruitment process was not only said to be lopsided but also shrouded in secrecy following management\u2019s inability to advertise the vacanciesin line with the law establishing the Federal Character Commission which mandates that vacancies for positions in the Federal Civil Service be advertised in one Southern and one Northern paper for a period of six weeks.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that this was the first time such recruitment of ATCOs in particular was happening in NAMA. The source further said the workers were told that management was able to get approval from the Federal Character Commission because it was allegedly told that what was being done was \u2018not a recruitment but replacement.\u2019\n\nSections 14.3 and 14.4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) requires that there shall be no \u2018predominance of persons from a few states or ethnic or other sectional groups\u2019 in the Federal Government and its agencies. But sources within the agency alleged that it was the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, that sent in the list of the candidates that were shortlisted and accused him of running a \u2018one man show\u2019 by exerting undue control over the six agencies under his supervision.\n\n\u201cAmong those were shortlisted for training as ATCOs, only one or two were from the South East, about three were from the South West, while 18 were from Katsina where the Minister comes from. The remaining recruits were from the rest of the northern states,\u201d a source told Daily Sun.\n\nBarely two years ago, the aviation minister was accused of being responsible for a similar lopsided recruitment into the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) when the agency needed security officers in all airports especially Lagos, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Abuja.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that at the time, FAAN had concluded interviews in all the airports and wanted to give priority to those who were already working as causal staff in the different states because they were used to the terrain.\n\nBut an insider told Daily Sun that after FAAN had concluded the interviews for the candidates, \u201c the minister\u2019s list suddenly emerged from the blues with majority of candidates on the list from the north and about 400 from Katsina alone.\n\nUnfortunately, those interviewed by FAAN who were expecting their employment letters were jettisoned.\n\nAccording to them, although the minister\u2019s candidates didn\u2019t go through any interview, they were given appointment letters and told to camp. After they were redeployed to different states from Katsina, most of them couldn\u2019t cope. How can you carry a level four officer from Katsina to Port Harcourt, how would they cope financially? Most of them returned to Katsina and they are there doing nothing. They just go to their farms and collect salaries at the end of the month because Katisna doesn\u2019t have a busy airport. FAAN had to continue overusing those who were at the airports where we needed people.\u201d\n\nIn his response, AviationMinistry\u2019s Director of Media and Publicity, James Odaudu, categorically denied the allegations leveled against Sirika, telling Daily Sun that the minister is a stickler for due process and was neither responsible for recruitment into agencies nor ensuring that vacancies in NAMA are published in national dailies.\n\nMeanwhile there have been strong concerns over evaluation process in NAMA as the shortlisted candidates in NAMA was conducted on April 12 at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) and the result of the exercise has already been released. Though it is still being kept under wraps, insiders within the agency allege that the evaluation was faulty and didn\u2019t follow the due process that would ensure that very competent people are selected as ATCOs.\n\nOne of the issues raised is that most of those recruited are far above the age of 27 required for the position of a cadet in the Air Traffic Control Department. A source told Daily Sun that in the employment manual, it was stated there that a cadet should not be more than 27 years.\n\n\u201cIf they employ cadets at 25 and they go to Zaria for training for two years, by the time they are through, they will be around 27 or 28 but instead Human Resources employed people that are over 30 years old and by the time they are through with training, they will be about 35 to 37 years. Those who drew up that policy did it because a cadet is supposed to be a trainee. You don\u2019t get someone who by the time he is through with NCAT, will have been 35 to come and train under someone who is 27 years old. This is a critical department that deals with the safety of people\u2019s lives. You don\u2019t bring in elderly people that would not fit to do the job. That is just one of the many criteria of the evaluation process that was not met,\u201d the source said.\n\nDaily Sun also reliably learned from another senior management staff who is not authorised to speak on such matters, that the Nigerian Air Traffic Control Association (NATCA) and the Human Resource department have been at loggerheads over staff welfare and recruitment. The body wrote a letter to the management of the agency, expressing concern over the secretiveness of the entire recruitment process and was very worried that considering the very sensitive job of an ATCO (Air Traffic Controllers are responsible for directing the safe movement of aircraft arriving and departing from airports), the Association needed to be involved in the evaluation to ensure that the candidates meet all necessary requirements and only the best hands are selected.\n\n\u201cThe questions the HR should be asked are what were the criteria for the evaluation? Were proper aero medicals carried out to ensure that they are mentally and physically fit? Who conducted the evaluation? Was a committee which includes experienced ATCOs set up? Why was NATCA not involved in the process as had been the tradition in the past? Because of the safety implications of air travel and the very sensitive duties of ATCOs, the recruitment should have been made open so that more people can apply and the best shortlisted.\n\nTypically, the pass mark for ATCOs in any examination is 75 percent and even if candidate scores 74 percent, the person would be considered to have failed but they just orchestrated the evaluation process in such a way that will make it easy for most of the shortlisted candidates to scale through.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf has said former President Olusegun Obasanjo, controversial Islamic cleric, Sheik Gumi and himself negotiated the release of the 27 abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kagara, Kaduna State.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on Arise TV yesterday, he said the team ensured the release of the students where the Federal Government failed.\n\nYusuf, a professor of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation said no ransom was paid for the release of the students.\n\n\u201cThe first and only negotiations that Sheik Gumi and Obasanjo got involved in, Obasanjo was emphatic that no ransom will be paid and we succeeded in doing that where the government failed. No money exchanged hands in the negotiations, no shot was fired and no life was lost. We did the negotiations and got to get these students released.\n\n\u201cThis is what our rural folks have been passing through for years now, negotiating to get their folks out, selling whatever they have, thanks to the inefficiency of our government. If anyone\u2019s loved one is taken, he will do whatever it takes to get the person out. That is what we have been going through for years, but it is making the news now because it is getting closer to the cities,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nHe also said the bandits want genuine peace because they are tired and that he has learned from several meetings with the bandits that they are willing to listen to religious leaders. He added that banditry is a social issue and should be treated as such. He also added that although there\u2019s a role for the military in the fight against banditry, it won\u2019t make the problem go away.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is what we find out, in all the five states we went in, they listen to clerics. In Niger State, they gathered in force to a meeting of war commanders, from six states, in the forest. There\u2019s a role for the military in all of these. Without the military, the North West would have been overrun by Boko Haram, the North Central will be overrun by these bandits, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) will overrun the South East, there will be warlords all-over South West.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for the military but if anybody tells you there\u2019s a military solution to this conflict, he\u2019s either dishonest or he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. There\u2019s no military solution to this problem. Banditry is a social problem and not a military one. We are increasingly militarising what is essentially a social problem. We are dropping a million-dollar bomb on people we should be providing water for.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Want appointments to reflect federal character\n\n\u2022Urge Buhari to address nation on insecurity\n\nBy Omon-Julius Onabu\n\nGovernors of the 17 southern states under the aegis of the Southern Governors Forum have called on the federal government to convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency to address widespread agitations among Nigerians for greater inclusiveness in governance.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency,\u201d they said in a communique at the end of their meeting yesterday in Asaba, the Delta State capital.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country and end to open grazing in the Southern parts of the country to curb the excesses of armed herders.\n\nIn the 12-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors stressed the need to review appointments into federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character and the heterogeneity of the Nigerian population.\n\nThey said in the communiqu\u00e9, read by the Chairman of the forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, that they had resolved to foster cooperation among the Southern states and the nation at large.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added that the governors reviewed the situation in the country and deliberated on the current security situation, agitations/restructuring, prospect for inter-state collaboration and partnerships as well as on the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTheir conclusion: \u201cWe affirm that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness, and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nObserving that the incursion of armed herders, criminals, and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security, the governors said open grazing has to stop.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria,\u201d they said, noting that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South.\n\nGiven this scenario, they said, it has become imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South, including cattle movement to the South by foot.\n\nThe governors also recommended that the federal government should support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nThey added that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance the commitment to and practice of true federalism.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is a need to review appointments into the federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogeneous.\u201d\n\nThey expressed concern over the continued gridlock on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway and the chokehold, it exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.\n\nTo ease the gridlock, the governors recommended the activation and establishment of ports in other states of the federation to create new jobs and promote socio-economic activities in the country.\n\nThe governors also expressed concern over the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and suggested greater coordination and cooperation between the federal and state governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\nThey further \u201cexpressed very grave concern on the security challenges currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr. President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people.\n\nBesides Akeredolu, other governors at the meeting were Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State;; Chief Willie Obiano of Anambra State; Senator Duoye Diri of Bayelsa State; Chief Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; Mr. Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; and Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nOthers are: Prince Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State; Mr. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; and Chief Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\nHowever, Prof. Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State were absent, while Mr. Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) and Senator Hope Uzodimma (Imo State) were represented by their deputies.\n\nACF Backs Ban on Open Grazing, Supports Restructuring\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has endorsed the position of the southern governors\u2019 forum on the ban on open grazing of cattle.\n\nSpokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe stated this while reacting to the outcome of the governors\u2019 meeting in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\nHe however said before a decision should be taken on restructuring, Nigerians should first agree on whether the country should remain one before deciding on what structure to adopt.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the ban of open grazing, I don\u2019t think there is much problem here with the stand of the ACF.\n\n\u201cAt our last National Working Committee meeting in Kaduna, the National leader of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria spoke to us at length and he said he and his organisation have decided that the only way forward and that is in the interest of MACBAN, is to embark on ranching and that they were waiting for governments policy on this\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nHe stressed further that, \u201cIf MACABAN wants open grazing banned, not only in the southern part of Nigeria but all over Nigeria, who are we to say otherwise?\n\n\u201cWe are therefore in support of the stand of MACBAN and the Southern state governors.\u201d\n\nHe however said, on the issue of dialogue and restructuring, \u201cthe ACF has always believed in this if the aim of the dialogue is to promote the unity and progress of the whole country.\n\n\u201cOur forum will dialogue with any state and group of people that share our cherished ideals of unity, justice, peace and progress\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nOn restructuring, he said \u201cthe ACF believes that before we make a decision on this, we should agree on whether Nigeria should remain one country before deciding on what structure Nigeria should take.\n\n\u201cOur position on this is informed on the facts that some of the advocates of restructuring are at the same time advocating the dissolution of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAre they believers in Nigeria at all? We must all agree to let Nigeria be before we move forward.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abacha\u2019s $311m refund intact, says Orji\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), manager of Nigeria\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), yesterday announced its audited results for its 2020 financial year, reflecting a strong financial performance and consistent implementation of strategic infrastructure investment programmes for the year.\n\nThe results showed that despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year under review, the NSIA recorded 343 per cent growth in its total income, which rose to N160.06 billion in 2020, up from the N36.15 billion in the previous year.\n\nAlso, excluding devaluation gain of N51 billion, the NSIA made a core income of N109 billion compared to N33.07 billion in 2019.\n\nIn addition, it achieved 33 per cent growth in net assets to N772.75 billion, compared with the N579.54 billion it achieved in 2019.\n\nNSIA Managing Director, Mr. Uche Orji, said at a virtual media briefing yesterday that the organisation received an additional contribution of $250 million and provided the first stabilisation support to the federal government of $150 million withdrawn from the Stabilisation Fund, in the year under review.\n\nSimilarly, the NSIA received $311 million from funds recovered from late Gen. Sani Abacha from the United States Department of Justice and Island of Jersey for funding of Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) projects such as Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 adversely affected logistics around infrastructure projects, especially the toll road projects, and the presidential fertiliser initiative. In response to COVID-19, NSIA partnered Global Citizen, a not-for-profit group, to form the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund. Separately NSIA acquired and distributed oxygen concentrators to 21 teaching hospitals as part of corporate social responsibility, in addition to staffing support to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19,\u201d Orji said.\n\nGiving a highlight on the activities of Nigeria Infrastructure Fund (NIF), he said projects under construction in the country had reached major milestones across domestic infrastructure projects in motorways, agriculture, and healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, in 2020, there were improved contributions from subsidiaries/affiliates such as Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company (InfraCredit), Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) and Family Homes Funds Ltd (FHFL).\n\nThe NSIA, he said, invested additional capital into NG Clearing, the first derivative clearing house in Nigeria to maintain NSIA\u2019s shareholding at 16.5 per cent following the company\u2019s rights issue of 2020.\n\nOrji said the NSIA in 2020 launched its Nigeria Innovation Fund to address investment opportunities within Nigeria in information technology with an immediate pipeline that included data networking, data centres, software, and services as well as agri-tech and biotech.\n\nIt also made progress on developing the ammonia and diammonium phosphate production plants in partnership with OCP in the review year, as it selected Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom as the venue after an extensive review of several other locations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the year under review, COVID-19 adversely impacted NSIA key infrastructure projects, with significant disruptions to the supply chains and logistics of NSIA\u2019s key projects. NSIA maintained its three-pronged investment approach: direct investments, co-investment with partners, and creation of financial institutions to fill critical institutional voids in the infrastructure landscape. In 2020 the Authority recorded significant progress on all fronts.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the Authority has invested significantly in crucial sub-sectors of the financial landscape with the intention of bridging critical voids that otherwise constrain investments and smooth operations in the sector.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the access roads to the Second Niger Bridge, 2A and 2B, 17.5 kilometres (Km) each (totaling 35km), were added to PIDF scope of work. \u201cThese had initially been part of scope expected to be carried out by the Federal Ministry of Works but owing to several challenges they have been unable to commence the projects leading to a transfer to the NSIA. The original scope of NSIA\u2019s section was 10.7KM of bridge and road, bringing the entire project to more than 45Km.\n\n\u201cAs of year-end 2020, the original scope of 10.7km Second Niger Bridge is at 53 per cent completion with a completion target of 2022. The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is at 66 per cent completion and is expected to be completed in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe initial scope of the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway is at 66 per cent completion. However, please note that the scope of the project has been expanded from the rehabilitation of 92.5km along the three sections of the road to the full reconstruction of the entire stretch of 375km, as directed by Mr. President; this has extended the completion date. The NSIA is exploring options to shorten the completion timeline for the project.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA ran the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) from December 2016 to December 2020, adding that the operator company \u2013 NAIC-NPK \u2013 has now been spun off to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI).\n\n\u201cThe Authority\u2019s role in the programme has shifted upstream. NSIA\u2019s role is limited to importation, storage, and the wholesale of raw materials to blenders. In essence, blenders are expected to build the capacity to actively participate in the sub-sector.\n\n\u201cOver the period it ran, 42 blending plants were enlisted under the programme while a total of 30 million 50kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 fertiliser were made available to the Nigerian farmers. Beyond serving a proof of concept for import substitution in the fertiliser space, the programme led to the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the agriculture value chain including in logistics, ports, bagging, rail, industrial warehousing, and haulage touchpoints amongst others. It also enabled the country to conserve foreign exchange that would have otherwise been used for subsidy payment,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on his outlook for 2021, he said the NSIA would raise fund by issuing a Sukuk bond.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAlthough NSIA believes the market is unlikely to repeat some of the performance of 2020, it is more likely that a broader market recovery will occur with economies opening unlike the case in 2020 in which technology stocks drove market performance.\n\n\u201cIn the Future Generations Fund, we expect to allocate more capital to venture capital, global equity markets, and increasing exposure to European equities where we had been underexposed in 2020. NSIA believes that the broad opening of the markets will provide a comprehensive lift to equities.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the Innovation Fund is expected to be very active as we see opportunities in data centers, data networking, software, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and many others.\n\n\u201cNSIA expects to complete concession, capital raise and operationalisation of the three PIDF road projects: Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway.\n\n\u201cDespite concerns around new waves of COVID-19, the Authority remains confident that with widespread vaccination programmes, global economies will continue to reopen and create more opportunities to create value by the NSIA.\u201d\n\nOrji also shed more light on the NSIA\u2019s financial performance when he appeared yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe explained that some of the NSIA\u2019s portfolios were up by as much as 50 per cent in dollar terms in 2020, predicting that although the financial technology sector ruled the market last year, there will be a broader profit ecosystem this year as countries continue to open up on the back of increasing COVID-19 vaccine jabs.\n\nAccording to him, the body has been aggressive in terms of its focus on international equities, private equity investments, venture capital and direct investments in the international market, where much of the profits came from.\n\nHe said with the exception of just one or two portfolios, every single asset class made substantial returns to the NSIA last year, with net profit of N108.9 billion.\n\nHe predicted a broader recovery for the equity side of the investments this year, saying that although stock market growth in 2020 was largely anchored on technology, activities in 2021 will be driven by aviation and the industrial sectors as the world opens up again.\n\nUche stated that fixed income should be closely watched by investors, except for the impact of inflation, which he predicted would make interest rates go up and make fixed income instruments fall.\n\n\u201cMy view is that on the balance of risk, we are more likely to see interest rates go up than go down,\u201d he added, noting that venture capitalist funds are also being explored by the organisation.\n\n\u201cOn the average, we had almost 30 per cent returns in dollar terms and we are going to be more aggressive in venture capital,\u201d he said.\n\nUche stated that the NSIA is also investing in fintech, software services, data networking as well as biotech and pharmaceuticals.\n\nBesides, the NSIA has also intervened in the diagnostics and radiology centres in Kano and Umuahia and the cancer centres at the Lagos Nigeria University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).\n\nIt is also discussing with the University College, London, to develop pharmaceutical industries in Nigeria.\n\nOn the Abacha loot, he stated: \u201cThe Abacha fund was $311 million that was returned to Nigeria by the US Department of Justice and Island of Jersey and the agreement was to spread the money in equal measures across three projects.\n\n\u201cThese are the Lagos-Ibadan Road, Abuja-Kano Road and the Second Niger Bridge. Each of them will get $103million-$104 million. To spend the money, we have been required to have external auditors aside from our in-house auditors as Deloitte to monitor the disbursement of that fund.\n\n\u201cA civil society group, CLEEN foundation has been appointed by the Ministry of Justice and also with the US government to also supervise the disbursement of the fund. So, you can imagine that every single pair of eyes possible are overlooking how these funds will be disbursed.\n\n\u201cThe fund is still there intact. Not a dime has been spent. It is being held in our accounts with the central bank.\u201d\n\nHe added that another \u20ac4.2 was being expected to be repatriated, which the authorities have agreed should come to the NSIA to be used for the three projects.\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA is planning to invest more in healthcare sector this year, with the ramping up of infrastructure in Abuja and an eye on 20 such centres nationwide.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nAn indigenous firm, UTM Offshore Limited, has signed a deal with Japan Gas Corporation (JGC), a leading international Engineering Design, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm, to establish a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility, the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\nThis followed the issuance of licence by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to establish the FLNG facility.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited took a major step to actualise the project yesterday, signing virtually, a landmark preliminary front end engineering design (Pre-FEED) agreement with JGC.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the Pre-FEED scope would be completed within four months from commencement date.\n\nUTM has also engaged Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) of the UK to provide owner\u2019s engineering services on the project.\n\nKBR is to provide due diligence on the JGC scope by conducting a third-party review of all deliverables from JGC during the Pre-FEED.\n\nSpeaking at the virtual signing event, the Managing Director of UTM Offshore Limited, Mr. Julius Rone, said JGC Corporation came highly recommended given the several similar projects the firm had undertaken across the world.\n\n\u201cWhat UTM is doing is largely novel. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria and we are very excited about this trail-blazing project: The opportunity to build from the scratch, the first floating liquefied natural gas facility in Nigeria is humongous. That is why we cannot afford to settle for less hence our resolve to contract JGC Corporation, one of the leading firms in the LNG Construction sector in the world, to provide the Pre-Front End Engineering Design Services for this first Floating LNG facility in Nigeria,\u201d Rone said.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited is pioneering the development of the FLNG facility in collaboration with LNG Investment Management Services (LIMS), a subsidiary of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe facility, a newly-built vessel, will receive gas feedstock from an existing offshore facility, treat it to required LNG standard, liquefy the gas, store the LNG and offload to LNG carriers.\n\nAccording to Rone, the floating LNG, when fully completed shall have an LNG production capacity of 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa), Turret and Mooring System, Gas pre-treatment modules, LNG production modules, living quarters, self-contained power generation and utilities as well as capacities for LNG storage and offloading.\n\nAt the landmark agreement signing event, Rone thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for creating an enabling environment for indigenous firms like UTM Offshore to equitably operate in the very sensitive and competitive upstream sector of the petroleum industry.\n\nHe said that the resolve of UTM Offshore to embark on the huge project is steeped in the National Gas Policy of the Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nRone said: \u201cAt UTM Offshore, we completely agree with Mr. President that given Nigeria\u2019s potential of about 600 trillion cubic feet of gas, the commodity has the enormous potential to diversify our country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe also agree that the rising global demand for cleaner energy sources has offered Nigeria an opportunity to exploit gas resources for the good of the country.\n\n\u201cWe thank the president for making gas development and utilization a national priority to stimulate economic growth, further improve Nigeria\u2019s energy mix, drive investments, and provide the much-needed jobs for our citizens in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, for tenaciously driving Mr. President\u2019s vision in the petroleum sector, particularly the gas policy.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to key players in the national petroleum industry, notably the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, and the Director of Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Mr. Sarki Auwalu, for their support for the FLNG project.\n\nAccording to him, other partners and critical stakeholders that are supporting the FLNG project include Afreximbank, NAPIMS, Templars, Vitol, Yahaska Energy Services Limited and the government of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI am particularly thankful to the visionary Governor of Delta State, His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who from Day One, believed in our dream of building the first Floating LNG in Nigeria and has been of immense support since then.\n\n\u201cWe cannot thank him enough. Indeed, we are assuring all our partners and stakeholders that we will not let them down,\u201d Rone said.\n\nAuwalu, who attended the event virtually lauded Rone and his team for blazing the trail in building Nigeria first Floating LNG. He said: \u201cIt is a historic event today as UTM Offshore working with our support is actualizing Mr. President vision not just for gas and the diversification of our economy.\n\n\u201cMr. President has promised to migrate Nigeria to gas and that is what UTM Offshore is doing with the decision to build and operate and FLNG. It is a tortuous process but I can confirm that UTM Offshore has met all the requirements and that is why DPR gave the firm license to proceed with the building of the FLNG.\n\n\u201cAt DPR we have been monitoring closely what UTM is doing and we are very happy that they are working with the best firms and consultants in the world, in fact, first-class and globally renowned firms are working with UTM Offshore to actualize this FLNG. DPR shall continue to guide and encourage UTM on this project.\u201d\n\nAn executive of JGC Corporation of Japan, Mr. Koji Sakrai, praised the vision and tenacity of Rone and his firm, pledging the commitment of his company to deploy the latest and cost-effective engineering design and constructions modules in undertaking the project and assured that the task would be completed within schedule.\n\nPresent at the agreement signing were the representatives of the GMD of NNPC, Mr. Abubakar Umar; representatives of Vitol, Mr. Chibuzor Ifeanyi; while Mr. Steve Brown also of Vitol joined virtually.\n\nAn Executive Director, Afrexim Bank, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna, joined virtually, while Mr. Peter Olowononi and Mrs Ngozi Kalu-Mba, also from the bank attended the event.\n\nSpecial Adviser on Investments to the Delta State Governor, Mr. Paul Nma, represented the governor, while Dr. Yahuza Kassim, who made a detailed presentation on the FLNG project represented Yahuza Energy Services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Reaffirms faith in God\n\nBy Chiemelie Ezeobi\n\nGeneral Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has broken his silence over the death of his son, late Pastor Oluwadamilare.\n\nThe third child of the family, Pee Dee, as he was fondly called, died last Wednesday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State, where he lived with his family and operated as the Assistant Pastor in charge of Region 35.\n\nThe 42-year-old, who fathered three daughters with his wife, Temiloluwa, was buried on Tuesday after a farewell service at the Youth Centre, Redemption Camp, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway .\n\nIn a video posted on his different social media platforms, Pastor Adeboye said \u201cwe lost a General but we didn\u2019t lose God. One man down, we regroup and advance!\u201d\n\nUrging Nigerians not to cry over the demise of his son, he rather called for prayers for his widow, mother, children, siblings and the entire family.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to thank each and every one of you, for this massive show of love, not just for Dare but for me, my wife, the widow, the children, the siblings\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful, I am only bringing you this brief message not just to thank you but to let you know that by the special grace of God, we are loved of God and because we are loved of God, we are more than conquerors.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that God who knows the end from the beginning, knew long before the foundations of the world that what has happened is going to happen.\n\n\u201cAnd because His word is forever settled, He said all things work together for good to them that love God. We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for good as individuals, as families and as a denomination.\n\n\u201cCry if you wish but don\u2019t cry for Pastor Dee (as Dare is fondly called) because he is resting in glory. Cry because you are the one still fighting the battle.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has caught a glimpse of heaven will not be crying for Pastor Dee because there is no comparison between heaven and earth. But then fight courageously because, on the resurrection morning, we shall meet again.\n\n\u201cIn one of his sermons, Dare himself said God does not need a visa to pay you a visit or to do whatever He wants to do in your life.\n\n\u201cAnd I have told you before, death is not a function of age. Young people die, old people die, children die. And it is not about how long you live, it is how well.\n\n\u201d Even Jesus Christ himself died at the age of 33. John the Baptist never lived to be 34 and yet he was the greatest.\n\n\u201cWe have lost a champion. You would agree with me on that. Let us consider him a seed that we have sown and let\u2019s get ready for a special harvest.\n\n\u201cI want us to join our forces together and produce many champions like Damilare that would go round the whole world and shake the world for the Lord Jesus. That is how we can honour his memory.\n\n\u201cThe church of God is marching on. It doesn\u2019t matter what the devil is thinking now. The devil was rejoicing the day the Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross but he never knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cThe devil was rejoicing when Job lost all his children but if only he knew what was coming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, tears poured as Pastor Dare was committed to mother earth after the farewell service.\n\nAmong the dignitaries on ground were Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide aka Winners\u2019 Chapel, David Oyedepo; his wife, Faith; Pastor David Oyedepo Jr; and Senior Pastor Covenant Christian Centre, Pastor Poju Oyemade; as well as thousands of worshippers and well wishers who connected physically and virtually.\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Despite $33 million Q1 revenue, Jumia\u2019s share price may take another nosedive after recent results",
          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "text": "Almost a month after Uber and Bolt drivers under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA) umbrella held a strike in Lagos, Uber has raised its prices. At the time of the strike in April, the President of PEPDA, Idris Shonuga, said one of the reasons the drivers were striking was the pricing of the rides.\n\nHe argued that the fare prices had become so low it was difficult for drivers to make ends meet and likened driving for cab-hailing services to a type of systemic poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a complaint that we\u2019re hearing from ride-hailing drivers worldwide. In March 2021, drivers made landmark progress after winning a lawsuit forcing Uber to classify them as workers instead of independent contractors.\n\nThat distinction is essential because classifying drivers as independent workers allows Uber and Bolt to avoid paying insurance, paid leave, and other benefits.\n\nThe victory of Uber drivers in London has led to a global push for a similar reclassification with drivers in South Africa and Nigeria planning class-action lawsuits against Uber and Bolt. For now, Uber drivers will take the small victory of raised prices.\n\nIn a statement to driver-partners, Uber said, \u201cWe remain committed to providing a reliable earning opportunity for driver-partners, as well as a reliable and affordable service for riders. With this in mind, starting 11th May 2021, we are increasing prices on UberX by about 13%.\u201d\n\nBetween 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Mondays, and 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Tuesdays through Friday, Uber riders will now pay a base fare of N237, minimum fare of N538; N70 per kilometre and N12 per minute. These fares are up from the previous minimum fare of N500, N200 base fare, N50 per kilometre and N11 per minute.\n\nAt other periods, riders will be charged a minimum fare of N575; a base fare of N255, N75 per kilometre and N12.5 per minute.\n\nThere are reports that the drivers are unimpressed with the changes seeing as one of their demands was that Uber reduce its commission from 25% and give them a say in deciding the fees.\n\nThe President of PEPDA wasn\u2019t available to speak on the phone at the time of this report.",

          "title": "Maviance raises $3m from MFS Africa to digitize financial services across Central Africa",
          "text": "Maviance, a Cameroon-based company providing digital financial services like agency banking and bulk bill payments, has raised $3 million (\u20ac2.5 million) in equity financing.\n\nThe investment is solely from MFS Africa, the cross-border fintech company connecting mobile money providers like MTN to banks like Ecobank across over 34 countries in Africa.\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s investment gives it an undisclosed minority stake in Maviance.\n\nMaviance\u2019s flagship product is Smobilpay, a platform that integrates payments solutions from banks, mobile money operators and telecoms operators. Smobilpay is connected to GIMAC, the interoperability switch of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) \u2013 the central bank of the Central African region.\n\nBecause it is a business-to-business company, Smobilpay may not be familiar with consumers. But the platform serves over 500,000 unique customers a month, according to the company.\n\nJerry Cheambe, Maviance founder, believes the pandemic has helped increase business owners\u2019 appetite for digitising payments. Cameroon is a country of 26.88 million people. Mobile connections increased by 11% to 26.6 million between January 2020 and January 2021 while internet penetration is at 34%.\n\nWith this seed funding, Maviance will expand Smobilpay\u2019s national footprint in Cameroon to serve more consumers and to move into Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Maviance will be building new products but they won\u2019t go to market within the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cOur journey now is to become a regional company, providing cross-border services within the CEMAC region. We want to be a catalyst for interoperability,\u201d Cheambe says.\n\nHe adds that Maviance chose to go with MFS Africa because they bring money, industry knowledge, a product suite and a pan-African network of fintechs and businesses of various sizes to the table. The deal took over a year, from contact to close.\n\nThe appeal for both companies is to collaborate on building digital financial services in the Central African economic region\u2019s 6 countries: Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nMaviance was founded in Germany in 2008 by Jerry Cheambe and Michael Flach. They launched Maviance Cameroon in 2012, at a time when mobile money looked unlikely in the country.\n\n\u201cI remember saying at one point that mobile money will not work in Cameroon because it was just not happening,\u201d Cheambe says to TechCabal.\n\nTen years later, the landscape has improved enough for Maviance to be raising a large seed round.\n\n95% of Maviance Cameroon\u2019s 20-person staff are based in Cameroon. Cheambe is based in Germany where he oversees Maviance Germany, which operates independently of the Cameroonian venture.\n\nAnother strategic move by MFS Africa\n\nMFS Africa has been on a roll of deals over the last 12 months.\n\nIn June 2020, the South Africa-based company acquired Beyonic, a Tanzania-based payments company, in a cash and shares deal that paid out at least 4x returns for Beyonic\u2019s investors. Last month, MFS Africa led a $2.3 million seed round in Numida, a credit provider for small businesses in Uganda.\n\nWith Maviance in the mix, MFS Africa continues a conscious push to be Africa\u2019s largest hub for digital financial services.\n\nAs with the Beyonic deal, the Maviance team was in the process of raising money when MFS Africa approached.\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, says Maviance has been on MFS Africa\u2019s radar for some time. What convinced him to initiate investment conversations with Cheambe?\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of the asset \u2013 what they have built on the ground \u2013 the ability to work with them and the shared vision of the founder,\u201d Okoudjou says to TechCabal.\n\nMFS Africa was already present in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, working with mobile networks MTN and Airtel. But MFS Africa can rely on Maviance to cover the region and carry out integrations much faster.\n\nThough MFS Africa had scanned the market for other possible partners, the Maviance team had a long-term focus on building solid foundations. It is a minority investment but \u201cobviously both Jerry and I know that there is a possible path forward together,\u201d Okoudjou says.",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew Episode!

Justice Esther Edigin for her contribution to the peace and development of the state, pledging that his government will sustain ongoing reforms in the judiciary.\n\nObaseki made the pledge when he received Justice Edigin who was on a valedictory visit to the governor at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nEdigin, who will be retiring on Monday, May 17, 2021, was sworn-in as the seventh substantive Chief Judge of Edo State on Friday, November 22, 2019, following the retirement of Hon. Justice Esohe Ikponmwen from the state\u2019s public service.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cWe have been very consistent, as a government, about the judiciary. The Judiciary is the anchor on which our democracy rests and as such must be treated and given its due place in our democracy.\n\n\u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to cover more grounds as desired in terms of judiciary transformation in Edo State. The Executive is currently going through that process as we have reforms to show; the legislature is also pushing for a very hard transformation and it will be our joy carrying the judiciary joins in this trend to ensure the transformation and modernization of the judiciary system.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki said his administration will continue to cooperate and work with the judiciary to make it more effective and efficient in discharging its responsibilities.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are dealing with a new world and nobody expected it as we were caught napping. Various institutions and states rely solely on one major source of resources. This is not good for us; it should be about our collective survival and not individual survival; we either sail or sink together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make Edo State the judiciary hub of this zone. As a government, we want to thank you for your services to Edo State. We will continue to reform the Judiciary system,\u201d he reassured.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Judge commended Governor Obaseki for the cordial relationship and cooperation with the Judiciary.\n\nShe said: \u201cl am here today to pay you a valedictory visit as part of events marking my disengagement from the Judiciary and Government of Edo State.\n\n\u201cI will be retiring next week, Monday, May 17, 2021. I want to thank the Edo State Government for the cooperation with the Judiciary. The government facilitated the construction and handover of 12 modern Courts to the Judiciary.

          "text": "The Edo Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may be poised for a showdown with Governor Godwin Obaseki over his alleged plan to dissolve the party executive at all levels in the state.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Mr Obaseki had on May 8, hosted a meeting of state party leaders at the Government House, Benin, with a proposed agenda to dissolve the PDP executives at all levels in the state.\n\nFollowing the proposal, the state chairman of the PDP, Tony Aziegbemi, and the Secretary, Hillary Otsu, wrote a letter on behalf of the elected officials to the national leadership of the party.\n\nIn the letter, which was made available to NAN, the expanded State Working Committee of the party rejected the proposal by Mr Obaseki to dissolve \u201ca legitimately elected executive\u201d.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cThe expanded State Working Committee and Local Government chairmen of the Edo State PDP reject in its entirety, the proposal to dissolve the legitimately elected executive committee members of the PDP at the Ward, Local Government and State levels.\n\n\u201cWe also condemn totally, the convening of such a meeting aimed at ambushing our State Chairman, who is constitutionally empowered to call such a meeting.\u201d\n\nThe party executives noted that only three old PDP members: Raymond Dokpesi, Tom Ikimi and Mike Oghiadomhe, were in attendance, as against 10 members from Mr Obaseki\u2019s team that decamped from the APC to PDP.\n\n\u201cWe hereby reiterate to the National Executive Committee of our party that the issue of dissolution of executive committees in Edo State is subjudice and it will be an act of contempt of court to revisit it.\n\n\u201cThe genesis of this looming crisis results from the acquiescence of the National Working Committee members who negotiated Mr Obaseki\u2019s movement to the PDP.\n\n\u201c(The committee did not) reach a verbal or written agreement on the integration of the new members, vis a vis, the sharing of appointments, after the elections had been won.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, condemn Governor Obaseki for re-appointing his former Secretary to the State Government (SSG) without any consideration for the \u2018legacy PDP\u2019 he joined.\n\n\u201cTo this end, they have consistently sang a tune of \u2018harmonisation\u2019 ever since Obaseki was sworn in, now that he has the \u201cyam and the knife\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved strongly that if any harmonisation must take place, it must start from the Governor\u2019s office, where his Deputy Governor should resign and a deputy nominated from the old PDP is sworn in.\n\n\u201cThis can be a spring board for broad harmonisation across the state party organs.\n\n\u201cThe proposed dissolution and, or, harmonisation are designed to hold Edo people and the PDP to ransom by the Obaseki-led administration. We will not accept this.\n\n\u201cEdo people voted for PDP and Godwin Obaseki to deliver the dividends of democracy to them.\n\n\u201cIf he wishes to appoint only his friends and former APC colleagues in his cabinet and sundry positions and leave out the legacy PDP members, so be it.\n\n\u201cWe, the state PDP leadership will not accede to any form of harmonisation that has no backing or interpretation in our party constitution.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe state party leadership said the governor was being misled by some groups of politicians in the state.\n\nIt was difficult to get Mr Obaseki\u2019s comment for this report as the governor was yet to appoint a spokesperson since his re-election.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "United Kingdom High Court has ordered JP Morgan Chase, the bank in the middle of the Malabu Oil and Gas scandal, to release more documents to the lawyers representing Nigeria, a major victory for Nigeria\u2019s federal government.\n\nNigeria had asked the UK court to force the United States bank to disclose more records ahead of a trial in which JP Morgan stands accused of enabling the misappropriation of almost $900 million in state funds.\n\nThe court on Tuesday, granted the Nigerian application to secure records from top US executives and compliance officers involved in signing off $875 million in payments between 2011 and 2013 relating to the controversial OPL 245 oil licence deal.\n\nLawyers representing Nigeria said last week that there had been \u201cserious issues\u201d with the US bank\u2019s approach to disclosure, adding that its focus on documents and interactions between staff in Europe was \u201cunduly narrow.\u201d\n\nDelivering the order, Justice Neil Calver said: \u201cA key issue in these proceedings is what JPMC knew and when it knew it,\u201d a report in yesterday\u2019s edition of Financial Times quoted him as saying.\n\nCalver ruled that certain US compliance documents, the significance of which JP Morgan played down at last week\u2019s hearing, were \u201clikely to be relevant to the case on gross negligence.\u201d\n\nThe trial, according to ThisDay, is due to start next February after the bank failed in a 2019 attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed.\n\nThisDay reports that the 2011 deal was an attempt to end a multi-year battle over the ownership of the lucrative OPL 245 oil licence. However, it ensnared European oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Eni in corruption investigations in Italy.\n\nThe licence, in the years prior, was shuffled back and forth between Shell and Malabu, a Nigerian oil company backed by a former Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete, that was first awarded development rights in 1998, when he was still serving under the late Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha (rtd).\n\nA Milan court in March cleared the oil companies and their senior and former executives of any wrongdoing, and Etete of corruption charges.\n\nBut Nigeria is pushing ahead with its case in London against JP Morgan and seeking compensation of $875 million-plus interest from the bank for facilitating two payments in 2011 totalling $801.5 million and one in 2013 for $74.2 million.\n\nThe country alleged that it was a victim of a \u201cfraudulent and corrupt scheme\u201d involving bribes paid to former and current Nigerian politicians and oil executives through the transfer of funds via Malabu accounts.\n\nJP Morgan had argued that it received sufficient approvals from Nigerian authorities before allowing the transfer of funds from a government account to those controlled by Etete.\n\nNigeria had also argued that JP Morgan breached its duty of care by going ahead with payments out of the government account despite having reasonable grounds to believe they were intended to defraud it. JP Morgan, the government said in court, \u201ctook the irrevocable step of paying vast sums away to Malabu\u201d.\n\nIt highlighted that JP Morgan had not only notified the UK\u2019s Serious Organised Crime Agency of the proposed payments, it had filed four \u201cSuspicious Activity Reports\u201d in 2011.\n\nA US-based compliance officer for JP Morgan also raised a red flag in 2013, saying in a memo revealed in court that \u201cin light of Malabu\u2019s reported connection to the alleged Nigerian corruption scheme, there would be a great risk presented if JPMC continues to process wires involving Malabu.\u201d\n\nThe memo was intended to prepare Pamela Johnson, the bank\u2019s global head of financial crime compliance, for a meeting with then Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Matt Zames, indicating the matter had escalated to the highest ranks of JP Morgan.\n\nThe bank is now obliged to share further documentation linked to Johnson and other top US executives, including Lester Pataki and John Gibbons.\n\nIn previous hearings, even as the bank said it had \u201cno responsibility\u201d to look behind any payment instructions, the judge said this was not consistent with the agreement the bank had with its client.\n\nfter the ruling, Financial Times quoted a representative of the Nigerian government to have said: \u201cIt is high time JP Morgan gave a clear and unambiguous account of exactly how the decisions to make these huge payments were made when it was on notice that to pay out risked its customer, Nigeria, being defrauded.\u201d\n\nLast week, fresh documents on the long-standing legal dispute between the federal government and Malabu Oil & Gas showed that JP Morgan may have been alerted by its internal control system that the transfers were questionable.\n\nA report by Bloomberg indicated that JP Morgan Chase & Co. was warned by its compliance team over the \u201cgreat risk\u201d of corruption just days before it made the last of three transfers that totalled $875 million to Etete.\n\nThe federal government had alleged that most of the $1.3 billion purchase price for the licence for the offshore oilfield known as OPL 245 was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen under previous administrations.",

          "text": "By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah |\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has affirmed that Nigeria\u2019s extremely bright economic future, which he said cannot be aborted despite current challenges.\n\nOsinbajo stated this on Tuesday while touring SecureID company\u2019s premises, a first in sub-Saharan Africa and one of the three such cutting-edge facilities on the continent, with top prime global certifications for smart card manufacturing .\n\nAccording to him in a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, despite challenges confronting the nation, he expressed optimism that the issues will be resolved.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe economic future of our nation is extremely bright. Yes, we have challenges today and they may look daunting. But let me assure you that these issues will be resolved. The march of this nation to its manifest destiny as Africa\u2019s leading economic power will not be aborted. We are more than able to overcome.\u201d\n\nAn impressed Prof. Osinbajo said the Buhari administration in \u201cfollowing the recommendation of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, has determined that manufacturing will be our main focus in bringing about dynamic growth, jobs and exports.\n\n\u201cThis will mean retooling our business environment for greater competitiveness, especially with the take off of the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are rethinking our tax regimes, sorting out external and internal trade issues, getting our regulatory authorities; SON, NAFDAC, and even Customs, to see their roles more as business facilitators rather than policemen or revenue generators. Our environment must be friendly for local businesses first, foreign investments will follow enthusiastically.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCommenting on the efforts of the administration to position the country as a leading economic beacon on the continent, the VP also stated that the Buhari administration was ramping up efforts in improving the country\u2019s infrastructure and digital space.\n\nHe said, \u201caside from the work we are doing with other infrastructure such as rail, roads and power we are committed to a plan of democratizing broad band connectivity. Our programme, which we have reiterated in our Economic Sustainability Plan, is broadband connectivity for all by 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy launched the National Broadband Plan which is designed to deliver data download speeds across Nigeria of a minimum 25mbps in urban areas and 10mbps in rural areas, with effective coverage available to at least 90% of the population at affordable prices by the target date. Broadband connectivity is as important as electricity in the digital age unlike electricity we do not have to make several mistakes before getting it right.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the efforts of the founder and Managing Director of SecureID, Mrs Kofo Akinkugbe, Prof. Osinbajo described SecureID facility as a place of history, innovation and creativity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis world-class manufacturing facility is reputed to be the first certified smartcard manufacturing plant in sub-Saharan Africa, the only smart card production and personalization plant in West Africa and one of only six on the continent and one of only 80 in the world.\n\n\u201cThe facility serves 21 countries across Africa and is fully certified by major commercial card companies \u2013 VISA, Verve and MasterCard. SecureID has shown that this country can be at the cutting edge of development in technology and digital enterprises. The world in which companies like SecureID operates, providing comprehensive end-to-end payment, identity management and digital security solutions is one that thrives on innovation.\n\nContinuing, the VP said, \u201cthe company has in these few years of her existence provided notable innovative offerings to the financial services sector, telecommunications, government, education, healthcare and private enterprises. Equally remarkable is the fact that with this facility, the company can produce all the payment cards, SIM cards, loyalty cards and the various identity management cards (residency cards, voter registration cards, drivers\u2019 license and national identity cards) required here in Nigeria, with capacity to spare.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations also for your successes in getting the certifications that will help to meet the demands of customers, such as Global System of Mobile Applications (GSMA), Visa International, MasterCard Incorporated, Verve, Card Quality Management (CQM), GH-link (for cards to be used in Ghana) and ISO 9001/2015 for Smart Card Manufacturing and Personalization of credit and debit cards.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we must also congratulate SecureID for earning the GSMA certificate last year; this is a world class security requirement for SIM card manufacturing and personalization. Your rapid expansion is also worthy of commendation, especially as you have added a number of subsidiaries, one of which is the digital arm of the business: SID Digital, while the other is involved in transport payment infrastructure. This has put the company in good stead to provide services ranging from identity management to tax collection, school management systems, health management systems, digital cards for the banks and, of course, e-ticketing for all forms of transportation, including road, rail and water.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier at the event, the founder of SecureID, Mrs. Kofo Akinkugbe, highlighted the significance of the Vice President\u2019s visit, noting that the VP has come to see some of the much-touted potential being realized. She added that SecureID was a good entrepreneurial story of an abiding faith in God and the nation, proving the viability of investing and staying in the course.\n\nAkinkugbe commended the federal government for establishing institutions and agencies to support and encouraged start-ups, MSMEs and other enterprises that had offered assistance to the company.\n\nIn his remarks, the representative of the Bank of Industry said he was excited to partner with SecureID, being a pioneer of world-class status in the industry, as well as making world class products, while generating foreign exchange earnings and creating jobs.\n\nOthers who spoke at the event were the Corps Marshall, Federal Road Safety Corps, Boboye Oyeyemi; Deputy Managing Director, First Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Gbenga Osoba.\n\nAccompanying the Vice President were the Deputy Chief of Staff to the President, Office of the Vice President, Mr. Ade Ipaye; Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada; representative of the Governor of Lagos State, His Lordship, the Anglican Bishop of Lagos State, Bishop Humphrey Olumakaiye and other government functionaries.",

There is no significant third party impact,\u201d Eni stated.\n\nHowever, an environmental rights group, Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) said that the incident which discharged crude and associated gas had severely polluted the environment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Non-Governmental Organisation said that a visit to the spill site showed pictorial evidence of the crude spreading beyond NAOC\u2019s right of way as nearby vegetation were withered as a result of the crude impact.\n\nAccording to a field report on the spill incident signed by Mr Alagoa Morris, Head of Field Operations at ERA/FoEN, the Idu fields was notorious for frequent spills caused by equipment failure.\n\n\u201cThe people of Egbebiri in Biseni kingdom have experienced several oil spills over the years. And all the oil spill incidents documented by the Environmental Rights Action/ Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) in this community environment have occurred as a result of equipment failure and on Wellheads.\n\n\u201cERA/FoEN has had cause to visit the environment of Idu Well 5 and 11 located within the same place in the past and it has always been Idu Well 11 spewing crude oil into the environment.\n\n\u201cAvailable records from ERA/FoEN indicate that there has been previous oil spills from this particular Idu Well 11 operated by Agip.\n\n\u201cBefore concluding this Field Report, ERA/FoEN confirmed that Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) was carried out on Sunday, 9th May, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is why the official Spill Reference No 2021/LAR/028/058 is indicated in this report; sourced from the JIV report. Cause of spill was attributed to equipment failure,\u201d ERA/FoEN stated.\n\nThe report quoted a resident of the community simply identified as Georgie as saying that the spill incident of May 7 spilled oil from around 10 p.m till about 8 a.m the next day before the leak was stopped.\n\nAccording to ERA/FoEN, the residents said that the level of damage was enormous.\n\n\u201cYou can see the level of damage all over ,we don\u2019t know what to do. But for now we are calling on relevant agencies to ensure that prompt action is taken so as to prevent the spill spreading to the water bodies in the environment.

          "text": "Agency Report\n\nThe Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) said that they had killed two senior Hamas chiefs, Hassan Kaogi, head of the Hamas military intelligence security department, and his deputy, Wail Issa.\n\nIDF said the intel chiefs were killed by Israeli fighter jets, tweeting \u201cLooks like our intel was better.\u2019.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll was 36 on Wednesday morning, with ten children among the dead.\n\nFive Israelis are believed to have been killed in the conflict, in the most intensive aerial exchanges for years.\n\nIsrael carried out hundreds of air strikes in Gaza into Wednesday morning, as the Islamist group and other Palestinian militants fired multiple rocket barrages at Tel Aviv and Beersheba.\n\nOne multi-storey residential building in Gaza collapsed and another was heavily damaged after they were repeatedly hit by Israeli air strikes.\n\nOther strikes targeted what the military said were rocket launch sites, Hamas offices and the homes of Hamas leaders.\n\nIt was the heaviest offensive between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war in Gaza, and prompted international concern that the situation could spiral out of control.\n\nU.N. Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland tweeted: \u201cStop the fire immediately. We\u2019re escalating towards a full scale war. Leaders on all sides have to take the responsibility of de-escalation.\n\n\u201cThe cost of war in Gaza is devastating & is being paid by ordinary people. UN is working w/ all sides to restore calm. Stop the violence now,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGazans homes shook and the sky lit up from Israeli attacks, outgoing rockets and Israeli air defence missiles intercepting them. At least 30 explosions were heard within a matter of minutes just after dawn on Wednesday.\n\nIsraelis ran for shelters or flattened themselves on pavements in communities more than 70 km (45 miles) up the coast and into southern Israel amid sounds of explosions as interceptor missiles streaked into the sky.\n\nIn the mixed Arab-Jewish town of Lod, near Tel Aviv, two people were killed after a rocket hit a vehicle in the area.\n\nLod and other mixed towns have been gripped by angry demonstrations over the Gaza violence and tensions in Jerusalem.\n\nHamas\u2019s armed wing said it fired 210 rockets towards Beersheba and Tel Aviv in response to the bombing of the tower buildings in Gaza City.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military says that around a third of the rockets have fallen short, landing within Gaza. It actually estimated the rockets at 1,050, fired in 38 hours across central and southern Israel.\n\nFor Israel, the militants\u2019 targeting of Tel Aviv, its commercial capital, posed a new challenge in the confrontation with the Islamist Hamas group, regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States.\n\nThe violence followed weeks of tension in Jerusalem during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, with clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters in and around Al-Aqsa Mosque, on the compound revered by Jews as Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.\n\nThese escalated in recent days ahead of a \u2013 now postponed \u2013 court hearing in a case that could end with Palestinian families evicted from East Jerusalem homes claimed by Jewish settlers.\n\nViolence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, where a 26-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli gunfire during stone-throwing clashes in a refugee camp near the city of Hebron.\n\n\u2018A VERY HEAVY PRICE\u2019\n\nThere appeared no imminent end to the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that militants would pay a \u201cvery heavy\u201d price for the rockets, which reached the outskirts of Jerusalem on Monday during a holiday in Israel commemorating its capture of East Jerusalem in a 1967 war.\n\nThe outbreak of hostilities led Netanyahu\u2019s political opponents to suspend negotiations on forming a coalition of right-wing, leftist and centre-left parties to unseat him after an inconclusive March 23 election.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid has three weeks left to establish a government, with a new election \u2013 and another chance for Netanyahu to retain power \u2013 likely if he fails.",

Some have even gone as far as suggesting a truncation of the democratic order, a clearly treasonable stance.\n\n\u201cWell, I am here today to assure all Nigerians that while the government acknowledges the security challenges we face at this time, from terrorism to kidnapping, banditry and farmer-herder conflict, it is definitely not overwhelmed and indeed it has the wherewithal, as you will see in the days ahead, to confront the challenges headlong and restore law and order, peace and security.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the most difficult things to do, for a democratically-elected government, is to use the instruments of coercion against its own people. For example, while the nation\u2019s military have superior firepower over the rag tag band of Boko Haram and ISWA, the terrorists most often than not operate among the populace, either in our villages or towns, hence the military, in tackling them, is usually careful to avoid collateral damage.\n\n\u201cThe same applies to the kidnappers who abduct our school children. Usually, the location of the kidnappers is not unknown to security forces, but they still have to exercise caution in order not to hurt the same children they are trying to rescue. Despite these inhibitions, the security forces have the wherewithal to decisively tackle the challenges,\u201d he added.",

The witness put the range at 40metres and said that even at that range it can still do maximum damage if it hits someone.\n\nOn further cross-examination by counsel to the Lagos State Government, Abiodun Owonikoko (SAN), the counsel asked the witness; \u201cWe had a General (from the Nigerian Army) testify before the panel that the AK 47 could cause damage even up to 350m? Do you agree?\n\nThe witness answered in the affirmative.\n\nThe Petitioner\u2019s counsel, Adebola Lema has adopted his final written address and asked the panel to take note of the inconsistency in the answer given by the witness as to the maximum range of the Ak 47.",

          "text": "When Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine is unloaded in countries around the world, hundreds of millions of doses will come with the label \u201cMade in China.\u201d\n\nChinese companies have made agreements over the past month to manufacture more than 260 million doses of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, which has been approved for use in more than 60 countries, including a large number of developing nations such as Mexico, India and Argentina.\n\nThe deals are symbolic of how China and Russia\u2019s international vaccine goals are increasingly aligned, as they assist developing countries neglected by their traditional Western partners who have been accused of hoarding shots.\n\nDuke University research shows that while some countries, such as Canada, the UK and New Zealand, have bought enough vaccines to cover their population more than three times over, the vast majority of countries have barely got doses for half their citizens, including some of the nations worst hit by Covid-19.\n\nBobo Lo, an expert on China-Russia relations and former deputy head of mission at Australia\u2019s embassy in Moscow, said both Moscow and Beijing saw an opportunity for geopolitical gains in the pandemic, winning favor and influence for their autocratic systems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s useful to them to point out that the West is being selfish in limiting the distribution of vaccine to developing countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a really convenient narrative for both Beijing and Moscow.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a welcoming ceremony on November 14, 2019 in Brasilia, Brazil.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a welcoming ceremony on November 14, 2019 in Brasilia, Brazil.\n\nThere is also a darker side to Moscow and Beijing\u2019s vaccine cooperation. In recent months, Russian disinformation efforts have tried to undermine confidence in US and UK vaccines, such as those made by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, according to Judyth Twigg, professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nChina has done the same, with state-run media hyping up reports of deaths from US and European-made vaccines.\n\nFormer diplomat Lo said both Russia and China had an interest in discrediting the US-led world order, particularly Beijing, which is keen for a chance to burnish its own reputation and promote itself as the leader of the global south.\n\n\u201c(China is saying), \u2018We understand you, we\u2019re not an imperial power like the Western powers \u2026 we\u2019re just here to help,'\u201d he said.\n\nRussia was the first country to announce it had produced a viable Covid-19 vaccine in August 2020, named Sputnik V after the country\u2019s history making satellite launch in 1957.\n\nInitial doubts over its effectiveness were tempered by a study published in the Lancet in February, which found in preliminary results that the vaccine had 91.6% effectiveness.\n\nNow, hundreds of millions of doses of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, along with China\u2019s Sinovac and Sinopharm shots, are making their way around the world, despite only Sinopharm being accepted into the World Health Organization\u2019s COVAX initiative. Neither Sputnik nor Sinovac has been approved by the WHO.\n\nIn Latin America, traditionally an area of US influence, countries such as Argentina and Chile have been buying up large numbers of Russian and Chinese shots to fill the gaps in their vaccine rollouts.\n\nAccording to Duke University\u2019s records of vaccine procurements, Argentina has placed orders for 30 million doses of Russia\u2019s Sputnik vaccine and 4 million doses of Sinopharm. To date, Argentina has not been able to strike a deal for the US Pfizer vaccine, although it has ordered 23 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s shot.\n\nIndonesia, a longtime US ally in southeast Asia, turned to China to order more shipments of Sinovac after its AstraZeneca order was delayed by a year due to the outbreak in India, according state-run Antara News Agency. To date, Indonesia has bought more Sinovac vaccines than any other country, at least 125 million doses, according to Duke University.\n\nThe second largest buyer of Sinovac is Turkey, a \u201ccritical regional partner\u201d for the US, according to the State Department. Turkey purchased 100 million doses of the Chinese-made shot, and started administering the first doses in January \u2014 it took four more months for US-made Pfizer shots to arrive. Ankara even sent hundreds of thousands of excess Sinovac doses of the drug to Libya.\n\nRussia\u2019s RDIF sovereign wealth fund said in February there had been requests for more than 2.5 billion doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. At the same time, Sinopharm said it had received orders for 500 million doses, according to the state-run tabloid Global Times. Meanwhile, Sinovac was being asked to deliver 450 million doses, and was planning to transfer the technology to manufacture the drug to 10 countries to assist in a rapid rollout, Reuters reported.\n\nMost of Russia and China\u2019s vaccine deliveries have been sold rather than donated, but an analysis by Think Global Health found that 63 out of the 65 countries Beijing had donated vaccines to so far were part of Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nChina isn\u2019t just producing its own vaccines \u2014 it is also helping to produce Russia\u2019s. By April 19, three privately-owned Chinese companies had struck major deals with Russia\u2019s RDIF to produce 260 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine \u2014 60 million by Shenzhen Yuanxing Gene-tech Co, 100 million by TopRidge Pharma and 100 million by Hualan Biological Bacterin Inc, according to the Global Times.\n\nThe deal is partially the result of inadequate manufacturing capacity in Russia. In January, the RDIF warned of delays of up to three weeks for countries waiting for their doses.\n\nChina\u2019s ability to manufacture vaccines for other countries, including Russia, is partially due to having the Covid-19 outbreak almost completely controlled within its borders and rapid upgrades to the country\u2019s manufacturing capacity.\n\nIn March, Sinopharm announced plans to create up to 3 billion doses per year, making it the biggest coronavirus vaccine producer in the world, according to state-run media. Sinovac said it was aiming to ramp up its annual capacity to 2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has been forced to cut deals with international suppliers to reach its delivery goals for Sputnik \u2014 in April, the RDIF announced 20 manufacturers in 10 countries would be making the shots.\n\nChina and Russia have had a rocky relationship over the past century, despite both being large Asian nations with a long history of Communist rule. There have been border clashes, political hostages and a famously long-running chilliness between Russian leader Joseph Stalin and China\u2019s Mao Zedong.\n\nBut in recent years, under Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, the two countries have developed a tight bond built on mutual geopolitical interests. In 2019, amid growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, Xi described Putin as his \u201cbest and bosom friend,\u201d while Putin said relations were at an \u201cunprecedented level.\u201d\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has strengthened those bonds further, with Russian ambassador to China Andrey Denisov saying in April 2020 that the two countries would fight the common enemy \u201chand-in-hand.\u201d \u201cAs we did in World War II,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an opinion piece in China Daily on April 7, China\u2019s ambassador to Moscow Zhang Hanhui said: \u201cThe more the world changes, the more chaotic it is and the more significant the great friendship between China and Russia is.\u201d\n\nThe cooperation has caused rising concern for some Western leaders. Speaking on March 25, French President Emmanuel Macron warned Russia and China could use their vaccines to exert influence over the developing world, in \u201ca world war of a new type.\u201d\n\nThomas Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Council for Foreign Relations, said many developing nations were \u201cdesperate\u201d for vaccines.\n\nBut Bollyky said while there might be some concern from the US government over any political influence China and Russia might be gaining from their rollouts, at the end of the day \u201cthe world needs more vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy only concern with the China vaccine and Russia\u2019s vaccine is they still haven\u2019t released the underlying clinical trial data too assess their safety and effectiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer diplomat Lo said while it was hard to know if the closeness would remain in the long term, for now both Xi and Putin were being brought together by the growing Western opposition to their governments. Under President Joe Biden, the US has increasingly focused on building coalitions of friendly nations to put pressure on Beijing and Moscow.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, the US is so evidently, for both Moscow and Beijing, the clear and present danger,\u201d he said.\n\nChina and Russia have denied they are engaged in vaccine diplomacy. Speaking at a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on March 23, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said both countries were engaged in \u201chumanitarian work.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike some major countries that are hoarding the vaccines for their own interests, we want to see more people immunized. Our hope is for the world to beat the pandemic as soon as possible,\u201d Wang said.\n\n\u201cFor China and Russia, our choice is not to benefit only ourselves, but rather to help the whole world.\u201d\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University\u2019s Twigg said China and Russia knew they had a very limited window in which to offer their vaccines to the developing world before Western nations caught up.\n\nQuestions have already been raised by some world leaders over Russia\u2019s motivations behind its rapid rollout of the Sputnik vaccine to developing countries.\n\n\u201cWe still wonder why Russia is offering, theoretically, millions and millions of doses while not sufficiently progressing in vaccinating its own people,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference in February. \u201cThis a question that should be answered.\u201d\n\nTo date, only 5.9% of Russia\u2019s population has been fully vaccinated. China said it had administered over 300 million doses of the vaccine as of May 7, but it isn\u2019t clear how many of those are first or second shots.\n\nEven if Russia and China can work quickly to vaccinate the developing world, some experts doubt their efforts will have the desired long-term political payoff.\n\nTwigg said the global rollout is still in its infancy and any number of developments, including Biden\u2019s to waive vaccine patent laws, could change the current vaccine landscape. By the end of the pandemic, she said most nations are likely to have inoculated their populations with a variety of vaccines from a number of countries.\n\n\u201cA year or two, or three, from now, the places where Russia or China got there first, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to remember,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN",
          "summary": "According to Duke University\u2019s records of vaccine procurements, Argentina has placed orders for 30 million doses of Russia\u2019s Sputnik vaccine and 4 million doses of Sinopharm.\nAt the same time, Sinopharm said it had received orders for 500 million doses, according to the state-run tabloid Global Times.\nChina and Russia have had a rocky relationship over the past century, despite both being large Asian nations with a long history of Communist rule.\nEven if Russia and China can work quickly to vaccinate the developing world, some experts doubt their efforts will have the desired long-term political payoff.\n\u201cA year or two, or three, from now, the places where Russia or China got there first, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to remember,\u201d she said.",
