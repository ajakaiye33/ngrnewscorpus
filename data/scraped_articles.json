Somalia is no longer the same today, because of war.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to even witness war throughout my lifetime, because we knew what we lost in Yoruba race during the 2020 #EndSARS protest.\n\n\u201cOn our part as YAF members, we want to warn sternly that we won\u2019t allow any group or individual to turn the Southwest into a theatre of war.\n\n\u201cOur Yoruba brothers involved in this evil enterprise or plot to destabilise the Yoruba race should retrace their steps to avoid dire consequences.\n\n\u201cWe recorded huge losses in the southwest during the #EndSARS protest in terms of burnt property worth trillions of naira, not to talk of valuable human lives destroyed due to the violence that followed the EndSARS.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, police, and men of the Nigerian army and other security agencies should take urgent steps to stop the Yoruba independence agitators and freedom fighters before they set the entire country ablaze\u201d.\n\nAnimashaun urged the federal government to display its political will by propelling the Department of State Services, military, and the police to activate their machinery against these elements in the southwest before the situation escalates.\n\nHe said if actions are not taken swiftly to checkmate the rising violent tendencies of the agitators, the southwest will be immersed into unprecedented cataclysm.\n\nAnimashaun added that; \u201cThese agitators were being emboldened by the recent spate of attacks on security infrastructure and personnel in the Southeast, especially the attacks on police stations and killings of innocent policemen.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that the masterminds of this violence are bent on throwing Nigeria into chaos to put governments at both state and federal levels into violence to enable them execute their respective evil plans for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that these elements have begun to mobilise their members in the southwest for the next phase of their so-called agitation for Yoruba indepedence and self determination by engaging in more violent protests and bloody confrontations with government.\n\n\u201cBut should they refuse to take our modest advice to desist from their devilish plans and unpatriotic activities in Yorubaland, they should be prepared to face dire consequences as we would no longer fold our arms and allow them destroy our peace, economy and social wellbeing\u201d, the YAF boss stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Sorlebari Sampson, over alleged anti-party activities during the April 17th, Local Government Council elections in the state.\n\nThe party also stated that it was considering the option of taking the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission, RSIEC, and other agencies of government responsible for the conduct of the polls in the state for deceiving and extorting money from unsuspecting candidates\n\nADC in a communique issued by the State Working Committee of the party in Port Harcourt, yesterday, noted that part of the reason for the suspension was that the chairman adjudged the LG elections as free, fair, and credible when the process was actually questionable.\n\nIn the document signed by Eke E., Secretary, Richard U. INEC Liaison, Victor Chukure, State Legal Adviser, Emmanuel Deinma, State Youth Leader, Ogbanga Sherry, Welfare Officer, Irene Jumbo, Woman Leader, and Egila Lucky man, Publicity Secretary, the SWC of the party urged the deputy Chairman to take over the role of chairmanship pending completion of investigations.\n\nALSO READ: Police parade 71 suspects in Delta\n\nReading the communique, Luckyman, stated that the chairman of the party in the face of the local government council elections in the state sold out the party for personal gains.\n\nLuckyman said: \u201cIn accordance to the party constitution in Article 16 Page 45 on Discipline of Members, the State Working Committee of our great party hereby suspends the Party Chairman, Amb.

They have deceived the people and have flouted the provision of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe House of Assembly should do the needful, maybe impeachment.

          "title": "What we owe each other",
          "text": "By Segun Gbadegesin\n\nThese are trying times. Insecurity has become the unfortunate norm and tension is understandably high. Between the rulers and the ruled, there is a deep-seated mistrust. One-time partners have suddenly become bitter adversaries. Before we approach the precipice of national existence, it is a good time to remind ourselves about what we owe each other. But to come to terms with what we owe each other, we must first understand what we have in common. What binds us together such that it demands of each of us specific obligations toward the other?\n\nWhat we have in common is not a common ethnicity. Neither is it a common citizenship. Nor is it a common religion. While some of us have each of these in common, each is also a basis for differentiation in other respects. Citizens are different from aliens in respect of their relationship to the nation. But there is something that a citizen has in common with a resident alien. And there is something an Orisa worshipper has in common with a Muslim even when they differ on account of the Being they worship.\n\nOur common humanity is what binds us together despite the artificial differences of ethnicity, nationality, or religion. The same blood runs through our veins. We share the dualism of body and soul. In addition to being commonly susceptible to physical and emotional pain and suffering, we also possess in common the distinctive quality of dignity which makes us objects of respect. We have the ability to think and plan our future and we have the inbuilt capacity to empathize with others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, while everyone readily concurs that he or she is endowed with every quality in the foregoing characterization of our common humanity, not everyone acts in ways that show or demonstrate that he or she recognizes the humanity of others. If we all did, we would not have the unfortunate cases of inhumanity of humans against fellow humans. We would not have kidnappers dehumanizing other human beings. We would not have killer herders maiming farmers and destroying their crops for the sake of cows.\n\nThe crux of what we owe each other is the recognition of our common humanity, its essential character, its basic needs and requirements, and the willingness, when we are able, to help facilitate its triumph over handicaps and obstacles. And since most of us claim allegiance to one or another religion, it is important to underscore the fact that this demand of recognition is the least common denominator of all religions.\n\nBut it is not just the monopoly of religion. It is also at the heart of every humanistic ethos.\n\nWhat does such a recognition entail? What are we required to avoid doing or to do when we recognize the common humanity of others? Both religious and secular ethics settle on these two broad categories: things we must not do and things we must do. For don\u2019ts, we are enjoined not to kill, steal, or defraud others, etc. For do\u2019s, we are enjoined to help others in need. Perhaps, for reason of enforceability, our laws and statutes focus on the former rather than the later. We don\u2019t generally have laws enforcing the obligation of charity.\n\nLet us admit that a general observance of the don\u2019ts in our legal system would serve us well as it ensures a peaceful and stable society, which in turn may enhance our individual ability to take care of ourselves without needing the charity of others. This is why the enforcement of those laws are of prime importance and why a society in which they are not, must be deemed as violating the requirement to recognize and respect our common humanity. It is also why we are gravely disappointed when our elected officials fail in their responsibility to enforce the law, thus endangering our common humanity.\n\nWhen laws that are supposed to enforce citizens\u2019 obligation to refrain from harming other citizens are trampled upon and government feigns ignorance or appears helpless, citizens are at the mercy of criminals as their humanity is abused and disrespected. We just heard about the pain of parents losing their job-seeking young daughter to a rapist-killer! It hurts and demeans us all.\n\nWe have an obligation to speak out in protest. We owe the young victim a duty in virtue of the common humanity we share to not let her killers escape justice. Furthermore, we owe each other the obligation to struggle to prevent a future occurrence. When we hear of protests motivated by systemic injustice in other climes, it is this obligation that individuals rally to discharge. Our common humanity beckons us to similar conduct. It may be misconstrued by governments as illegitimate or hostile, but that is their take. Ours is respect for the common humanity that they sometimes despise.\n\nAs important as the duty to refrain from harming others is, it doesn\u2019t exhaust our moral obligations. Importantly, we have an obligation to help others. This is especially important in the time and era that we find ourselves with many people hurting through no fault of their own. And just as the duty to refrain from harming others, the duty to help is also common to all ethical traditions.\n\nIn African traditional religions, as in almost every known religious tradition, emphasis is placed on kindness, not just to relatives but also to strangers. In the Orisa tradition of the Yoruba, Orunmila admonishes his followers to be kind because kindness begets kindness. We are assured that the calabash of a kind person doesn\u2019t break. The dish of a kind person doesn\u2019t crack. Instead, a kind person will have an abundance of wealth and children. In other words, there is no regret in practicing kindness.\n\nZakat is a core obligation in Islam. Muslims are required to help the poor and needy in proportion to their means. They are urged to be liberal in giving because whatever good they send off before their souls, they shall find it with Allah, echoing the Biblical injunction to Christians to provide for their house in Heaven by giving to the needy here on earth.\n\nIn the Christian faith, Jesus Christ personified this attitude to humanity with his own ministry of teaching, healing, and compassion. He did not just focus on evangelization. He deliberately sought after the welfare and wellbeing of people. Whenever he saw his followers in pain or in need, he had compassion over them. It was this compassion that led him to feed 5000 people and 4000 people on different occasions.\n\nJesus also taught compassion. With the parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus established charity as a requirement for the faithful, insisting that our neighbors are not necessarily those living next door to us. They are whoever crosses our path and needs our help. As we also see in that parable, we don\u2019t have to have a common ethnicity or religion. The Levite who bypassed the robbery victim was of Jewish origin and faith as the victim. The Good Samaritan, on the other hand, was of a different faith. Yet he was used by God to come to the aid of a Jew because he saw in him a common humanity.\n\nOn their part, secular philosophers of various persuasions are united in their embrace of charity as our moral obligation. We are to act in such a way as to bring about the most good or happiness. Lack of basic needs detracts from human happiness. Not knowing where the next meal will come from is stressful. Many children face such predicaments for no fault of their own. If we are endowed, we have an obligation to help those less endowed.\n\nAnd should anyone feel unmotivated to help others, he or she must remember that by having such a mindset, he or she is signaling to others to have the same mindset. The problem is that since no one knows the future, everyone soon need the help of others, but will not get it because others would have shared her or his uncaring mindset.\n\nMake the world better for humanity. Lend a hand to those in need.",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigeria needs to get the ongoing linking of SIMs to National Identification Numbers (NIN) right, saying it would determine the success of the ongoing war against insecurity.\n\nThe President stated this during the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration at the State House in Abuja.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, the President said proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and ability to conveniently access a database will provide impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to fully participate in the ongoing synchronisation of the NIN with SIM cards across the country, saying it would provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening of the economy.\n\nRead Also; NIN registration deadline now June 30 with 54m enrolled\n\n\u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President said the launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was quite timely and would support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe NIN is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN.

Camillus Ejike Mbaka of the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria violently broke into the diocesan cathedral church and desecrated the holy alter of sacrifice.\n\n\u201cOver and above this, they brutally vandalised the diocesan bishop\u2019s residence, the cathedral parish house and the secretariat building complex.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I hereby declare and call for a one week union of prayer in reparation and atonement for this heinous act against our central place of worship and the sanctity of the church.\n\n\u201cThe prayer begins from Friday 7th May to Friday 14th May 2021. Every parish, chaplaincy and religious community in the diocese is obliged to participate in this holy activity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn addition to the traditional May devotion prayers (like daily benediction), the following prayers are to be offered for this purpose:\n\n\u201c(a) Five decades of the Holy Rosary, (b) Act of reparation in the Most Blessed Sacrament, (c) Psalms 51 and 23.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you to remain sober and keep the diocese in prayer.

So, I am telling you the truth about what happened.\n\n\u201cWhen Bishop asked me to go and take you people back to Adoration, I asked him what happened now because you told me that I am going to stay away and silent for 30 days?\n\n\u201cThen, he said I should go first and tell you people to go because things are getting worse.\n\n\u201cThis is why people should understand how God works. I never disobeyed the church. People are busy misquoting me doing everything to close this ministry but by the grace of God they cannot do anything.\u201d\n\nMbaka said Onaga summoned him over his recent comments concerning the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu and his connection to the presidency.",

The alleged movement of the bandits caused a stir in the FCT forcing many schools in Bwari to be hurriedly shutdown, with messages sent to parents to pick up their wards from hostels in the area.\n\nA private university owned by the Catholic Church, Veritas, and a polytechnic located close to Bwari have all shutdown and students ordered to go home.\n\nActing Secretary of Education for the FCT, Leramoh Abdulrazaq, assured that security measures have been put in place to ensure the safety of schools.\n\n\u201cThe police, Department of State Security, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, air force, and even the army, as we speak, are in schools that are in session to ensure adequate security,\u201d he said.\n\nBut residents of the attack prone communities appear not to take Abdulrazaq assurances seriously as it was learnt that some parents in the area have refused to send their children to school, pending when security situation would improve.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that residents are taking extra steps to boost their personal security.

In the coming days, residents will see more movement of security agents. There will be stop and search operation too. Bwari which has become a major flashpoint for kidnappers and bandits in FCT will be thoroughly policed. The government can\u2019t wait and allow terrorists to overrun Abuja.

          "title": "Buhari: NIN Registration Essential for Winning War against Insecurity",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday described National Identification Number (NIN) registration by Nigerians as key to win the ongoing war against insecurity.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Nigerians to fully participate in the ongoing synchronisation of NIN with SIM cards as it will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy.\n\nThe president, at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration at the State House, Abuja said proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database would provide the impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\nHe assured the nation that his administration is fully committed to the safety of Nigerians, adding that linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid national planning and budget preparations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was timely as it would support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies align with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security and anti-corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe digital economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 per cent double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 per cent. This is truly commendable.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the digital economy sector provided online options for activities hitherto restricted to offline channels, while minimising the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors, and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe also said the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe federal government embraced institutionalising online meetings through the approval of the national policy on virtual engagements in federal public institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce, is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the president added.\n\nBuhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past.\n\n\u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Pantami had appreciated the president for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nAccording to him, NIN Registration has recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, with over 12 million of them enrolled within six months.\n\nHe said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that could be used in various transactions, adding that the NIN and SIM card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 per cent of the target audience.\n\nPantami stated that the buoyancy of the telecoms sector has given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world class SIM card manufacturing company sited in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Extends \u2018Naira 4 Dollar Scheme\u2019 to Sustain Gains",
          "text": "\u2022Again, Emefiele opposes maize importation, tasks youths on agriculture\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday extended indefinitely its \u2018Naira 4 Dollar Scheme\u2019 introduced to encourage remittances from Nigerians in the Diaspora.\n\nThe CBN, in a circular posted on its website, said the initiative initially expected to end this month would continue until further notice in order to sustain the gains of the scheme.\n\nAlso yesterday, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said the bank would continue to resist the importation of maize into the country.\n\nThe CBN had in a circular dated March 5, 2021, signed by Mr. A.S. Jibrin, on behalf of the Director, Trade and Exchange Department stated that the \u2018Naira 4 Dollar Scheme,\u2019 which became effective in March, would end tomorrow.\n\nWith the initiative, all recipients of Diaspora remittances through CBN\u2019s licensed International Money Transfer Operators (IMTOs) are paid N5 for every $1 received as remittance inflow.\n\nThe CBN, in the circular, had said: \u201cThe CBN shall through commercial banks, pay to remittance recipients the incentive of N5 for every $1 remitted by the sender and collected by the designated beneficiary.\n\n\u201cThis incentive is to be paid to recipients whether they choose to collect the United States dollar as cash across the counter in a bank or transfer same into their domiciliary account. In effect, a typical recipient of Diaspora remittances will at the point of collection, receive not only the USD sent from abroad, but also the additional N5 per USD received.\u201d\n\nBut the CBN, in the latest circular shifting the deadline said: \u201cFurther to the CBN circular referenced: TED/FEM/PUB/FPC/01/003 dated March 5, 2021, on the above subject matter, which was originally scheduled to end on May 8, 2021, we hereby announce the continuation of the scheme until further notice.\n\n\u201cAll aspects of the operationalisation of the programme remain the same. Please take note and ensure compliance.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had highlighted the benefits of the scheme, saying that it was expected to attract Diaspora remittances through the official foreign exchange channels as well as support forex stability in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele had said it would offer Nigerians in the Diaspora a convenient way to send remittances, adding that it would also aid Diaspora investments.\n\n\u201cOur policy on the administration of remittance flows is aimed at increasing the transparency of remittance inflows, reducing rent-seeking activities, and providing Nigerians in the Diaspora with cheaper and more convenient ways of sending remittances to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we believe that this new policy measure will encourage banks and financial institutions to develop products and investments vehicles geared towards attracting investments from Nigerians in the Diaspora. We have no doubt that these changes can help to finance a future stream of investment opportunities for Nigerians living abroad,\u201d he had said.\n\nAgain, Emefiele Opposes Maize Importation, Tasks Youths on Agriculture\n\nIn another development, Emefiele yesterday expressed the bank\u2019s continued opposition to the importation of maize into the country.\n\nAccording to him, maize farmers currently have what it takes to close the over 4.5 million metric tonnes demand gap.\n\nHe said with over 50,000 bags of the commodity readily available as well as other aggregated quantities across the country, the farmers were sending a message that \u201cwe can grow enough maize to meet the country\u2019s demand.\u201d\n\nEmefiele, during the unveiling of the first maize pyramid and the launch of 2021 maize wet season farming in Katsina State also challenged the youths to embrace agriculture.\n\nHe assured them that the central bank is ready to support farmers to better their lots and contribute to the nation\u2019s economic development.\n\nHowever, while reiterating the apex bank\u2019s opposition to the importation of maize, Emefiele stated that it would further, resist attempts by those who seek to continually import maize into the country.\n\nHe said the maize unveiled at the ceremony would be sold to reputable feed processors and that this would impact positively on current poultry feed prices.\n\nJustifying the bank\u2019s continued strategic intervention in the value chains of focal crops, he said the CBN was leading the revolution \u201cbecause the impact of our monetary policy measures would be limited, if the monetary authority in collaboration with the fiscal authorities failed to address some of the structural constraints that limit productivity in key sectors of our economy such as agriculture.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the bank\u2019s intervention is in line with its mandate and aims at ensuring price stability as well as improved availability of staple food items.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN and Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) sought to increase the targeted hectarage for 2021 to 500,000 hectares from the 2020 target of 250,000 hectares.\n\nHe added that to achieve the target, the apex bank resolved to introduce the use of contiguous land, high yielding seeds, mechanisation, leveraging technology for land mapping and monitoring as well as expanding the Strategic Maize Reserve (SMR).\n\nEmefiele said, so far, the bank had released 100,000 metric tonnes of maize to the market, through the major producers and urged all stakeholders to sustain the current efforts to galvanise agricultural production to meet the requirements of Nigeria\u2019s growing population.\n\nHe said the country could not continue to dwell on the neglect of past years, if it was determined to realise the national target of producing what Nigerians eat and eating what is produced in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, he expressed the belief that youths could leverage their talents, along with technological tools to improve farm productivity and delivery of agricultural produce to markets.\n\nEmefiele said while agriculture offered benefits for the youths, the central bank had put in place measures to improve access to credit for youths interested in farming under the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) as well as the Agri-Business Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme(AGSMEIS).\n\nHe added that groups of youths with contiguous land for farming are eligible to seek the bank\u2019s support through its prime anchor arrangement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CBN will not only provide access to credit for these youths but will also provide guarantees that their products will be purchased by a prime anchor at agreed prices.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Governor of Katsina State, Hon. Bello Masari, said that the state had suffered a setback in agriculture as over 60,000 hectares of farmlands were uncultivated due to banditry that has hindered farmers from gaining access to their land.\n\nHis counterpart from Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari at the occasion, however, reassured the farmers, processors and other value chain participants of the support of government towards ensuring that they perform optimally.\n\nHe said the availability of inputs such as high yield seedlings and fertilisers were being made available to farmers adequately in addition to prompt off-taking of produce.\n\nAlso, Governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Badaru Abubakar, however, recalled with nostalgia that the historical groundnut pyramids he read about in history books were \u201ctoday being seen physically in rice and maize across the country through the help of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe encouraged the youths to take advantage of the CBN support schemes and embrace agriculture for wealth creation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nThe Senate yesterday assured the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, the service chiefs, Acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Alkali Usman, and heads of intelligence agencies, of its readiness to ensure that they have all they need to tackle the worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, gave the assurance while welcoming the security chiefs to a closed-door meeting with senators over security challenges facing the nation.\n\nThe meeting, which was in response to last week\u2019s summoning of the CDS and service chiefs by the Senate lasted for about four hours.\n\nEarlier, Lawan had told the security chiefs that they were doing their best in providing security for Nigeria and Nigerians in an extremely difficult situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe parliament is ever ready to make the necessary interventions required. The Senate and by extension, the National Assembly is ready to give expeditious consideration to whatever the supplementary budget is presented by the executive in this regards because the environment must be stabilised for Nigeria to be a hub of foreign and local investments.\u201d\n\nHe identified poor funding of the military as hindering the ability to surmount resurgence of insurgency and banditry.\n\nHe told the service chiefs that they haven\u2019t achieved the optimum, which can be attributed to inadequate resources; hence the essence of the meeting, to brief the lawmakers on what they think will help them and other security agencies to perform better.\n\nLawan, however, commended the security agencies for fighting the security challenges nationwide, saying that some personnel in the process lost their lives.\n\nHe said: \u201dWe appreciate what you are doing because we know that you are doing your best with what you have at hand. I want to assure you and everyone that the challenges we face are taken seriously and extremely by the parliament. Hardly a day passes without this Senate discussing one security incident or the other. And it has been so for many years, not only this session.\n\n\u201dWe pray that at the end of this interaction, we will see better ways and means of providing the necessary provision of resources to enable our armed forces to continue with national case to provide national security that we need to protect the lives and property of citizens to stabilise our environment for the economy to receive better investments for this country; to be a hub for investments that will provide employment opportunities to our teeming youths.\u201d\n\nThe Senate spokesperson, Senator Ajibola Basiru, told reporters after the executive session, that the service chiefs briefed the senators on the state of security in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the security chiefs gave an analysis of their various corporation and activities, the topography across the six geopolitical zones, the complexities and challenges that are being faced and the ways they believe that the parliament can work together with the executive and heads of security agencies to curb insecurity.\n\nHe said the lawmakers also thanked the service chiefs for their forthrightness, and pledged commitment to ensure all necessary legislative and appropriation support to all the relevant agencies.\n\nHe said: \u201cAfter listening to the briefings, I personally became upbeat that a lot of work had gone into addressing the problem of insecurity and from the various perspectives that were brought into the discussion which is very frank, clear and without any form of duplicity, it became very clear that Nigerian security agencies are not only looking at the internal dimension of the challenge we have, but we also look at all ramifications both in terms of the political context, economic context and international context to the development.\n\n\u201cThere were even perspectives as to what happened recently in Chad was also considered. So it is a very thorough discussion and I also believe that the forthrightness of the leadership of the security agencies showed the seriousness that they attached to that exercise.\n\n\u201cSo, I believe that going forward, the confidence has been built between the security chiefs on one hand and the Nigerian parliament on the other hand and that would be a good signal of what we expect in the future.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the discussion concerning the supplementary budget and how much the parliament is likely to approve, Basiru said no figure was mentioned, adding that the legislature is awaiting a supplementary budget request.\n\nHe said: \u201cFirst of all, we didn\u2019t talk about money or figure; we spoke on general challenges and requirements for us to have efficient and effective security. The details on the supplementary budget can be worked on by the ministry of finance and the relevant committees of the National Assembly. Everybody knows security is a serious matter and just like the Senate president said last week, we are committed to ensuring appropriate funds for that. We can\u2019t delve into figures now until the relevant arm of government does the needful, so we are ready to receive the supplementary budget request.\n\n\u201dOn synergy among the various agencies, we don\u2019t have any doubt about that, there\u2019s synergy among them. For security, you feel the impact when there are breaches, nobody will give you credit when there are breaches. We have a tremendous report to show that a lot has gone into stemming the tide of insecurity in Nigeria, and it\u2019s due to that synergy and efforts. There\u2019s a need for improvement and we are committed to that.\u201d\n\nBesides Irabor, others at the meeting were Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru (Chief of Army Staff); Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu (Chief of Naval Staff); and Vice Marshal Isiaka Alao (Chief of Air Staff).\n\nThe rest were the Acting IG, Usman Baba, the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Munguno (rtd); Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd); Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ahmed Rufai Abubakar and the Director-General of Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Biden And 100 Days \u201cAmerica\u2019s House Was On Fire\u201d By Chido Nwangwu",
          "text": "President Joe Biden loves to paint and persuade with bold strokes on the canvas of public policy.. He likes to paint big picture of the possibilities and power of the United States. On April 28, 2021, he assessed the country at the joint sitting of the U.S Senate and House of Representatives, fo make the point that just before and shortly after he took over, \u201cAmerica\u2019s house was on fire.\u201d\n\nFor those who might have, willfully, forgotten, he was hinting at the massive disruption of regular living, more than one half of a million deaths and other devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially, its decimation of small business and wider economic insecurity that came with it.\n\nIndeed, \u201cAmerica\u2019s house was on fire\u201d, at the time, regarding the issue of COVID-19 because of the truancy, incompetence and lies told to Americans by our former, impeached President, Donald J. Trump. Here is the contrast; according to Biden: \u201cWhen I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected.\n\nSenior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%.\n\nAnd, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\u201d\n\nWithout any doubt, \u201cAmerica\u2019s house was on fire\u201d, in part, because Mr. Trump instigated and inflamed most of the desecration and destruction which took place on January 6, 2021 as an armed attack, an insurrection at the U.S Capitol by his supporters and foot soldiers. Yes; as in most cases regarding the direction and vitality of this country, America triumphed.\n\n\u201cNow \u2014 after just 100 days \u2014 I can report to the nation: America is on the move again,\u201d Biden said, adding that the U.S. is now \u201cturning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden's first words dramatized part of the trail of overcoming and moving forward to greater, unfold in chapters of history when he said:\n\n\u201cMadame Speaker.\n\nMadame Vice President.\n\nNo president has ever said those words from this podium, and it's about time.\u201d\n\nChido Nwangwu\n\nYes; for the first time in the history of the United States, two women were in the immediate line of succession to the presidency, the most powerful position in the world!\n\nFor proper record and identification: \u201cMadame Speaker is Nancy Pelosi, and Italian American.\n\nMadame Vice President is Kamala Harris, a Black woman.\n\nI believe and think that it is important to share with you the very significant text of his introductory comments; he spoke to the spirit and resilience of America. Here:\n\n\u201cMy fellow Americans.\n\nWhile the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different - a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in.\n\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world.\n\nTo declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities.\n\nTonight, I come to talk about crisis - and opportunity.\n\nAbout rebuilding our nation - and revitalizing our democracy.\n\nAnd winning the future for America.\n\nAs I stand here tonight - just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration.\n\n100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis.\n\nThe worst pandemic in a century.\n\nThe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nThe worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\n\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again.\n\nTurning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.\n\nLife can knock us down.\n\nBut in America, we never stay down.\n\nIn America, we always get up.\n\nAnd today, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew.\n\nChoosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness.\n\nAfter 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff.\n\nWe are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again.\n\nWe have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America.\u201d\n\nA critical segment of Biden\u2019s plan to ensure that America neither quits nor stays down is a relatively expensive yet important $4 trillion infrastructure, child care and early education agenda. Predictable denunciation came from the Republican party leadership and activists who called the price tag \u201csocialism\u201d and unrealistic tax-and-spend plan. Biden insists he wants to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, water pipes and other technology-related and environmentally progressive investments. \u201cFor too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis\u2026. Jobs. Jobs.

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions.

CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "Is there a ride-hailing service in Gabon? Yes, Gozem just launched there this week.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Emeka Ajene and Raphael Dana, Gozem operates an app that offers transportation, logistics, e-commerce and financial services in primarily-francophone African countries.\n\nGozem is aiming to be the super app for Africa and is modelled after the success of Gojek and WeChat in Southeast Asia and China respectively. While it is only one of many super app candidates in Africa, geographic expansion is a signal of strong intent.\n\nUntil the rollout in Gabon, Gozem was only available in cities across Togo and Benin, offering motorcycle taxis, tricycle taxis, and delivery of groceries, gas bottles, and meals.\n\nThe company says it has more than 500,000 registered users who have completed more than 2.5 million trips since inception.\n\nGabon will be Gozem\u2019s first operation outside of West Africa. The Central African country\u2019s population is under 2.5 million with almost 75% under the age of 30.\n\nScreenshots of the Gozem app. Image source: Gozem.\n\nThe ride-hailing feature is the only service Gabonese users will find on the app at the moment and it is only available in Libreville, the capital city.\n\n\u201cOur immediate focus is on providing a high-quality, reliable taxi service in that city, and then expanding the range of services we offer to Libreville\u2019s population,\u201d Ajene, Gozem co-founder and CEO, said to TechCabal.\n\nLaunching a taxi service in Gabon helps the company \u201cdiversify away from our beginnings as a 100% motorcycle-taxi oriented platform.\u201d\n\nWith Libreville in the mix, Gozem now operates in 10 cities across West and Central Africa. Ajene notes that most are not capital cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed an in-house capability to operate effectively in secondary cities in the region and there are one or two additional cities that you might ultimately see Gozem operating in in Gabon,\u201d he said.\n\nOne point of curiosity in this expansion is that Gabon is a smaller country by population compared to Togo (~8 million) and Benin (~ 12 million). Ajene acknowledges that but explains that purchasing power is another consideration that bears on expansion plans.\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita,\u201d Ajene said.\n\nIndeed, Gabon\u2019s 2020 GDP per capita was estimated to be $7,185, more than thrice the sum of Benin\u2019s $1,259 and Togo\u2019s $690.\n\n\n\nGozem\u2019s ride-hailing offering will work in Gabon like a standard app-enabled taxi booking service. Users download, sign up and input their destination to request rides. Driver accepts and the fare is calculated by distance. Users can pay in cash, with Airtel Money or Moov Money, or by credit card.\n\nRaphael Dana, Gozem co-founder, says the launch responds to the needs of the Gabonese population and aligns with Gozem\u2019s long-term plan to organise transport and commerce in Africa around the ongoing smartphone and internet revolution.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to consolidate our status as the premier super app in Africa, and this expansion to Central Africa, our first foray outside of West Africa, also allows us to prepare our upcoming expansion to Cameroon,\u201d Dana said.\n\nThe expansion to Cameroon is on the calendar for this year; DR Congo is also being explored. Beyond moving into new countries to enable taxis however, Gozem plans to make its other verticals compete with incumbents in the markets they currently operate.\n\n\u201cWe have robust food & e-commerce delivery verticals, we\u2019re beginning to see a significant impact coming from our vehicle financing vertical as well, and our plans for our full-service wallet are still on track,\u201d Ajene said.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nComments",

As it were, its focus is currently on Francophone African markets.\n\nResidents of Libreville \u2014 Gabon\u2019s capital \u2014 can now access digital ride-hailing services on the Gozem app, as the service is not yet available outside the city.\n\nGozem\u2019s operations initially spanned only cities in the Republic of Benin and Togo \u2014 two West African countries. Both have a larger population than Gabon\u00b4s 2.5 million populace. Per TechCabal, the startup\u2019s CEO and Co-founder, Emeka Ajene, stated the reason for focusing on Gabon:\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ride-hailing service will carry out operations similar to Uber and Bolt. Charges will be based on the distance covered. Payment can be made with cash, credit cards, Airtel Money, or the Moove Money Fintech platform.\n\nSince its launch in 2018 and early beginnings in Togo as a motorcycle ride-hailing startup, Gozem has made its ambition to be Africa\u2019s no.1 super app very clear. Today, the app has diverse verticals in electronic transportation, food delivery, eCommerce, logistics, and financial services, with customers\u2019 needs the determinant of further expansion.\n\nGozem is not the first African-based startup with super app ambitions. Startups like OPay in Nigeria and CanGo in Central Africa began with similar aspirations.\n\nCanGo unexpectedly shut down in January 2020, while certain challenges peculiar to the Lagos State market proved to be a stumbling block to OPay, which dropped the ambition and focused on fintech.\n\nGozem\u2019s Central African launch proves it is as dogged today in the pursuit of its vision as it was when it started. Time will tell if it will record success as a super app.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAre you building a startup business within Port Harcourt but struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

The future of Edo State is very bright; our citizens must not lose hope in this Government. All we need to do is to look inward and organise ourselves.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t have strong institutions, as godfathers, in the past, replaced the institutions. It\u2019s not godfathers that determine the way a state or system should be run but the people and the institutions.\n\n\u201cWe must have strong institutions that will make the system work without depending on any godfather to determine the way things are done.

Government can\u2019t be singlehandedly hijacked by some persons.\u201d\n\nNoting the role of Edo women in ensuring socio-economic development in the state, Obaseki said: \u201cThe women are the pillar which our society rests and if not for them I may not have been Governor for a second term as they are the ones helping to confront the \u2018Lions and Tigers\u2019 threatening to distract our government from working for the people We have no choice but to work for Edo people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe campaigned against godfathers during the September election and we won to push them out of the system.

          "title": "Police detention facilities overcrowded as judiciary workers\u2019 strike continues",
          "text": "Yunusa Agali and nine others have been detained by the police in Abuja since their arrest for burglary and theft on March 26 and 27.\n\nThe 10 of them have now spent over a month in a notorious detention facility, commonly referred to as \u2018Human Abattoir\u2019 which was used by the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other police tactical units.\n\nThe police have refused to grant them administrative bail, saying the offence is not bailable.\n\nThe police were supposed to promptly prefer charges against them and arraign them before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nThe Nigerian Constitution provides that no suspect can be held in custody for more than 48 hours for any reason. Suspects should either be released on bail or arraigned in court within the stipulated period.\n\nThe suspects could not be arraigned because courts across the country have been shut down since April 6 due to a strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\nMr Agali\u2019s lawyer, Bala Dakum, told PREMIUM TIMES that he could have also gone to court to file a fundamental rights enforcement suit for his client and ask for bail, were the courts open.\n\nHe expressed frustration about his inability to secure his client\u2019s bail through any legal means for over one month.\n\n\u201cAll the odds are against a suspect at this time. You are completely at the mercy of the police and other arresting authorities, who have earned a reason to keep suspects in custody as long as they wish.\n\n\u201cThey have no court to take the suspect for arraignment as prescribed by the constitution, and the suspect too has no court to go to assert his fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nAnother crime suspect, Usman Maidabo from Bauchi State who was arrested on April 13 by the police and remanded at the SWAT detention facility at Area 3 in Abuja, over alleged disappearance of seven persons, has not been able to secure his bail.\n\nSure of his innocence, Mr Maidabo, the leader of a vigilante group in Nabardo, Bauchi State, travelled down to Abuja on April 13 to submit himself for police interrogation.\n\nBut since then, his situation has remained like that of Mr Agali and the nine others.\n\nThe situation of prolonged detention of crime suspects due to the lingering strike action by judiciary workers is not peculiar to the police, as the State Security Service (SSS) is equally involved.\n\nIn a letter dated March 22, 2021, Rickey Tarfa, a lawyer to some members of bureau de change operators who were nabbed by operatives of the service on allegations of terrorism financing, threatened to sue the agency over the continued incarceration of his clients.\n\n\u201cThe fact of their continued detention for about two weeks now without being charged to court or released on administrative bail is a negation of the extant provisions of Section 35 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended),\u201d Mr Tarfa, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, said in his letter addressed to the Director-General of the SSS.\n\nBut Mr Tarfa has not been able to make good his threat to take legal action for the release of his clients while the security service continues to hold on to them.\n\nOvercrowded detention\n\nThe situation at many police detention centres has worsened since the ongoing JUSUN strike began.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis reporter had the opportunity to join a monitoring team dispatched by the Administration of Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee (ACJMC) to tour some police detention facilities within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on April 27.\n\nAt the Police Divisional Headquarters at Nyanya, a suburb of Abuja, the detention facility was brimming with suspects and was an eyesore.\n\nAlthough the facility was monitored under strict supervision of police officers with the visitors barred from going in with phones or cameras, dozens of suspects were seen screaming from their crammed cells overlooking the facility\u2019s hallway.\n\nOn one occasion, they were seen surging towards the divisional police officer (DPO) as he crossed into another office in the building.\n\nEven if one were visually impaired, the pungent smell oozing from the cells was enough to tell of an overcrowded detention facility calling for decongestion.\n\nThe situation was equally chaotic at the Kabusa police station, Apo in Abuja located in a densely populated area with low-income earners.\n\nCrime suspects were seen crammed in a cell while their relatives declined to speak to PREMIUM TIMES as they wore long faces at the police counter as their efforts to secure bail were unsuccessful.\n\nDifferent strokes\n\nLed by Moyo Olufemi, an administrative officer at ACJMC, the monitoring team visited the Police Divisional Headquarters at Wuse Zone 3, an area in the Abuja city centre, where they interacted with police officers on duty to ascertain how they were coping with the issue of congestion at the cells.\n\nMr Olufemi said the visits had become necessary in view of the lingering strike by court workers and the attendant impacts on criminal justice dispensation.\n\n\u201cWe are touring police detention facilities in line with the ACJMC mandates to ascertain the challenges being faced by the police in detaining crime suspects given the fact that courts across the country are shut due to the strike action by judiciary workers. The ACJMC seeks to understand first-hand the impacts of the strike on the police with a view to finding an interim measure of addressing the challenges of congestion in police cells,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ACJMC team also visited the Police Divisional Headquarters at Garki, which is also located in the heart of Abuja.\n\nSimilarly, the team visited the Police Divisional Headquarters at Apo.\n\nThe condition of the detention centres at the police stations visited by the team in the Abuja city centre is in sharp contrast with that of the suburbs of Nigeria\u2019s capital city as the latter were overcrowded.\n\nFor instance, as of the time of the visit to the Garki police station, there were only 14 detainees, comprising eight suspects who were originally arrested by the division, and six brought to the division from the Federal Criminal Investigation Department.\n\nPolice officers speak on worsening conditions\n\nThe police had in the wake of the JUSUN strike directed its divisions and formations to avoid unnecessary detention of suspects.\n\nIt also recommended dispute resolution mechanisms in deserving cases to avoid detention of suspects for petty crimes.\n\nBut despite this, police officers who spoke with our correspondent painted a picture of a widespread congestion of police detention facilities across the country.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with our correspondent, the officer in charge of the legal department of the FCT police command, James Idachaba, said police detention facilities were overcrowded with crime suspects due to the closure of the courts.\n\n\u201cWell, the negative impacts of the ongoing strike by judiciary workers on police detention facilities cannot be overemphasised. You know police activity is 24 hours of everyday; since we cannot stop our operations by way of arrest and investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nAs an interim solution to the problem, Mr Idachaba said the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali, directed that only suspects arrested for serious offences should be detained.\n\n\u201cSo, what we are trying to do is to comply with the Inspector General of Police\u2019s and Commissioner of Police, FCT\u2019s directive that only suspects with serious offences like kidnapping, violent crimes like armed robbery, culpable homicide, rape and the likes are to be detained because we don\u2019t have power to release those ones on bail,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice officers also told the ACJMC team during the tour of the detention facilities in Abuja that they collaborate with nominal complainants to resolve minor offences such as theft by granting bail to suspects.\n\nThey said that they transfer crime suspects in violent crimes such as armed robbery, culpable homicide and kidnapping to detention facilities of the FCID, which is located at Area 10 in Abuja.\n\nSuggesting that the current worrisome state of many detention centres would likely remain till the end of the ongoing strike, Mr Idachaba said, \u201cWe have no other option but to continue to keep them until the courts open for the purpose of proper prosecutorial procedures.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOur facilities are overwhelmed but we cannot stop arresting criminals, we cannot stop investigating and we cannot stop carrying out our police activities; we must do our job.\n\n\u201cSuspects with minor offences are not in our facilities; as soon as the preliminary processes are done, they are granted bail.\u201d\n\nAnother police prosecuting lawyer, Oladiran Ayodele, who is based in Lagos, shared Mr Idachaba\u2019s concerns about the overflowing police cells in different parts of the country.\n\nHe pointed out that crime suspects cannot be held beyond 48 hours without being charged to court as provided in the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, except for capital offences where a court order would be required to further keep a suspect for the purposes of investigation.\n\nSpeaking on the prolonged strike, Mr Ayodele said it had brought Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system to a standstill with the attendant effects being criminals roaming the streets freely.\n\n\u201cThe danger in all of this is that criminals roaming the streets freely, because if we (police) arrest them, we cannot charge them to court within the stipulated time by the constitution as a result of the court shutdown,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the situation has led to an increase in crime rate across the country.\n\n\u201cFor instance, since the strike commenced, someone was defrauded of N3 million, and the alleged fraudster switched off his phones. We want to get the person arrested and also get an order from the court to freeze the person\u2019s account. But with the court closure, it would give the criminal the opportunity to squander the money, the proceeds of crime. It is a serious issue,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the strike has forced on the police a situation whereby suspected criminals are being released without facing charges.\n\n\u201cThe effect the JUSUN strike has had on police detention facilities is that the constitution is very clear; you cannot detain someone for more than 48 hours at most, depending on the distance of the court from the detention centre. If the distance of the court is within one kilometre, then you can only detain a suspect for only 24 hours. However, a reason the police would detain a crime suspect for more than 48 hours is if the person committed a capital offence such as armed robbery, murder and so on.\n\n\u201cSo, once suspects are arrested, they are granted bail because courts are not open; the doors of our courts are locked. So, our reason for detaining is to charge suspects to court if they are found to be culpable of the offence. Now, the strike action has affected Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system. Criminals are walking the streets freely and committing more crimes.\u201d\n\nHuman rights community expresses concerns\n\nAn expert in the criminal justice sector, Uju Agomoh, said the strike action had plunged Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system into another major crisis even as the courts were yet to recover from the lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMrs Agomoh, who is the founder/Executive Director of Prisoners\u2019 Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA), a non-governmental organisation committed to criminal justice reforms, said the strike is a \u201chuge challenge for Nigerian Correctional Service already battling with issues of huge percentage of restive awaiting trial persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot taking them to court may be the reason for increased restiveness leading to more custody management problems.\n\n\u201cWorst hit in all these is the Nigerian police whose cells are allegedly overflowing with arrested and detained persons because there are no courts to arraign these persons,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said the \u201chuge challenges\u201d for the criminal justice system \u201cstares us in the face and the need to apply all recommended solutions to the identified challenges becomes much more imperative.\u201d\n\nThe police at the different divisions have resorted to granting administrative bail to persons arrested for petty crimes and who are able to provide sureties, Mrs Agomoh observed, but quickly added that \u201cit is obvious that there is need to do more in terms of fundamentally dealing with issues of arrest and detention in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nProffering solutions to the issue, she said it was time for the country and the police in particular \u201cto creatively look at what the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial measures says about pre-trial detention being a measure of last resort.\n\n\u201cIf we have this as our default system in our legal system, we will not be having a serious crisis like the one presented by the ongoing JUSUN strike,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother human rights lawyer, Frank Tietie, said the ongoing strike also presents unscrupulous police officers an avenue to extort crime suspects.\n\n\u201cWith the strike action by JUSUN, nothing has changed. The police have always made bail very difficult. They have always exercised their right to grant administrative bail but often in abusive terms; abusing the provisions of the Police Act and the constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recalled that even when the courts were in operation, \u201cthe police operated the bail system much without the intervention of the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough it is clearly stated that bail is free, the police see bail in general practice as an opportunity for financial enrichment.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think that the courts being on strike have affected that clich\u00e9 of bail is free, because bail has never been free. The only difference is that much more would be paid by detainees in police custody for their bail. Police officers that have been generally involved in bribe-taking; bribe in exchange for bail are the ones who are benefitting at this time,\u201d he added.\n\nACJMC\u2019s \u2018extrajudicial\u2019 intervention\n\nAccording to Tunde Dawodu, Executive Secretary, ACJMC, efforts were being put in place to reduce the crisis of overcrowded police detention centres.\n\nHe told PREMIUM TIMES that his committee was engaging heads of courts with a view to finding \u201cextrajudicial\u201d ways of dealing with the problem.\n\n\u201cWe are engaging with heads of courts, particularly magistrates in terms of what interim measures we can put in place to deal with the emergency.\n\n\u201cWe have appealed to heads of courts to ensure that they come up with something outside the strike.\n\n\u201cThere are suspects that are on remand and their cases have not been reviewed, the heads of courts need to take extra steps to get it done extra-judicially,\u2019 Mr Dawodu explained.\n\nThe ACJMC, established by the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, is tasked with far-reaching statutory roles to ensure a fair and smooth operations of the criminal justice system.\n\nSection 470 of the law, for instance, charged the committee with the responsibility of ensuring effective and efficient application of the Act by the relevant agencies.\n\nSubsection (1) of Section 470 also mandates the committee to \u201censure that criminal matters are speedily dealt with; congestion of criminal cases in courts is drastically reduced.\u201d\n\nIn addition, it orders the committee to ensure \u201ccongestion in prisons is reduced to the barest minimum; persons awaiting trial are, as far as possible, not detained in prison custody; and the relationship between the organs charged with the responsibility for all aspects of the administration of justice is cordial and there exists maximum co-operation amongst the organs in the administration of justice in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNBA\u2019s position\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, the 1st Vice President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), John Aikpopo-Martins, who is the co-chair of the Human Rights Committee of the body of Nigerian lawyers, said the association had yet to monitor congestion at police stations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have not directed our members to monitor the prisons and other detention facilities. However, the NBA leadership will direct members to monitor police stations across the country with a view to rendering pro bono (free legal services),\u201d he said.\n\nDays after speaking with our reporter, the NBA Human Rights Committee chaired by Mike Ozekhome, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, directed its members to regularly visit police stations to see suspects detained for minor offences were granted bail.\n\nThe directive was contained in a memo signed by the committee\u2019s secretary, Bernard Onigah, and addressed to all NBA chairmen and vice-chairmen.\n\n\u201cYou should intervene and ensure that suspects involved in minor offences and petty crimes are granted bail on liberal terms, pending the calling off of strike by JUSUN,\u201d the memo dated April 28 read in part.\n\n\u201cYou should work closely with the Divisional Police Officers and police counsel to ensure the protection of the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and also provide advice to the police when necessary and needed.\n\n\u201cThis exercise is to continue throughout the duration of the strike as further directed by the chairman,\u201d it added.\n\nAfter a meeting with the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Muhammad, last week, JUSUN vowed to continue the strike until its demands are met.\n\nCrippling strike\n\nThe nationwide strike started on April 6 to press for the judiciary\u2019s financial freedom from the executive.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported that the strike has stalled the trial of 47,416 inmates held in pre-trial detention across the correctional services\u2019 facilities in the country.\n\nThis figure constitutes about 72 per cent of the total 65,781 inmates in the country\u2019s correctional facilities as of April 6 when the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) posted the last update on its website.\n\nThe correctional services would not accept any inmate without a court order, a condition that saves it of additional burden of congestion during the court strike, but the protracted industrial action dampens the prospect of government\u2019s efforts to reduce overcrowding mainly constituted by awaiting trial inmates in the facilities.\n\nThe strike, which entered its fifth week on Tuesday, has no end in sight, as government authorities, particularly state governors, who are the main target of the strike, have not held any meeting with the leaders of the striking union after the last scheduled one failed to hold.\n\nSection 121(3) of the Nigerian constitution provides that heads of various courts and legislature at state levels should receive their monthly allocation directly from the consolidated revenue account of the federation, but governors would rather receive the funds meant for their states and only release money to the other arms of government as they please.\n\nThe governors have remained defiant in disobedience to a couple of court judgments delivered in 2014 ordering the government to comply with the constitutional provisions.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in May 2020 signed an executive order for the enforcement of the constitutional provision but failed to commence its implementation after the 36 state governments rallied themselves against it.\n\n\u201cMy appeal to the state governors is that they should ensure that the judiciary is completely autonomous. There is a court judgment as well as a presidential order to that effect (the Executive Order 10). So, the judicial arm of government should be financially independent,\u201d Mr Ayodele, a lawyer in the police legal department, said.",

Nigeria\u2019s Zenith Bank Plc and Access Bank Plc are among suitors that have expressed interest, alongside other African rivals such as Morocco\u2019s Attijariwafa Bank, the people said.\n\nMiddle Eastern banks and private equity suitors have also shown interest, according to the people. Some potential buyers have indicated they may acquire all of Atlas Mara\u2019s remaining assets in Africa, which would include its Zimbabwe unit, the people said.\n\nAtlas Mara has been working with Rothschild & Co. to consider options for its Union Bank stake, Bloomberg News has reported. No final decisions have been made, and there\u2019s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people told Bloomberg.\n\nRepresentatives for Atlas Mara and Zenith Bank didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attijariwafa Bank Managing Director Ismail Douiri and a representative for Access Bank declined to comment.\n\nA deal could bring down the curtain on Atlas Mara\u2019s African foray after Diamond, a former Barclays Plc chief executive officer, misjudged competition on the continent and overpaid for acquisitions. The company said on Wednesday that it\u2019s secured regulatory approval for the sales of its businesses in Botswana and Mozambique and received interest in other assets, without elaborating.\n\nAtlas Mara also said it completed a planned restructuring proces, and extended a standstill agreement with its creditors to May 17 to complete necessary documentation.

You know they threatened to kill all of them (students) after a particular deadline but after talking to them, they are now lowering their bar.\n\n\u201cSo, we are thankful they have stopped killing. And we are still negotiating with them. I hope this Afaka case will also encourage them to know that there is hope in negotiation and release the children.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his role in the release of the 27 Afaka students, Gumi said: \u201cThe role myself and former President Olusegun Obasanjo played in the release of the 27 Afaka students is the role of mediators because the fight is not between us and them but between the bandits and the government.\n\n\u201cWhat we understand is that these people were trying to attack the government by attacking the government institutions and taking innocent children.\n\n\u201cHaving understood that, we came to the conclusion that this is not a hopeless situation. We can really go in and negotiate for the release of these children which we did after so much ups and downs.\n\n\u201cBut in the long run, a conclusion was reached and these children are out. So, we are happy that all of them are out and none were killed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the reported swap of a bandit for the students, Sheikh Gumi said: \u201cI cannot confirm that but I can quote the Governor of Kaduna when the children of Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cHe said it is the duty of the government to use whatever means possible to save the lives of Chibok girls. This is a general rule that life is more precious. Now, I am happy that 27 lives have been saved.\u201d\n\nThe Afaka parents were led by their chairman and spokesman, Usman Abdullahi and Friday Sanni.\n\nThey thanked the Islamic cleric and begged him to help convey their appreciation to former President Obasanjo who worked alongside the cleric to bring back their children from captivity.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians to participate in the ongoing synchronization of National Identification Number (NIN) with SIM cards across the country, as it will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy.\n\nThe President stated this at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration in Abuja.\n\nHe said \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari noted that proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database will provide an impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\n\u201cThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was quite timely and will support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies were in full alignment with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security, and anti-corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Digital Economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 percent double-digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, the ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 percent. This is truly commendable,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the digital economy sector provided online options for activities that were hitherto restricted to offline channels while minimizing the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe added that the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government embraced institutionalizing online meetings through the approval of the National Policy on Virtual Engagements in Federal Public Institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements, and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the Policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past: \u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe assured that his administration was fully committed to the safety of Nigerians and linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid in national planning and budget preparations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy appreciated the President for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nThe minister noted that the NIN Registration had recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, adding, \u201cwithin six months over 12 million enrolled.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr Pantami said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that can be used in various transactions, assuring that the NIN and Sim card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 percent.\n\nHe said the buoyancy of the telecoms sector had given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health, and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world-class sim card manufacturing company in the country.",

          "title": "Ethiopia Replaces Head of Interim Government in War-torn Tigray",
          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s federal government has replaced the head of the interim administration of Tigray, a region racked by more than six months of catastrophic conflict.\n\nMulu Nega had held the position since November, shortly after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military campaign against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), the northern region\u2019s ruling party that had dominated national politics for decades.\n\nMulu was replaced by Abraham Belay, who had been serving as minister of innovation and technology in the federal government, Abiy\u2019s office said in a Twitter post on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe appointment is a result of a six-month performance review of the role,\u201d Abiy\u2019s spokeswoman Billene Seyoum said. Abraham is a member of Abiy\u2019s Prosperity Party.\n\nAbiy said on November 4 he was sending troops into Tigray after accusing the TPLF of orchestrating attacks on federal army camps. The TPLF, which was at the helm of Ethiopia\u2019s governing coalition for nearly 30 years until Abiy took office in 2018, denied responsibility and said the reported attack was a pretext for an \u201cinvasion\u201d by federal forces and allied troops from neighbouring Eritrea.\n\nAfter federal troops took the regional capital Mekelle in November, Mulu set about trying to establish an interim government even as fighting raged elsewhere in the region.\n\nIn an interview in February, he said he knew Mekelle residents had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about his presence in the office formerly occupied by their overthrown leaders.\n\nHe said he was happy in the job but did not want to stay on for long, and that he was planning to leave after elections are held in Tigray. The region will not take part in national elections planned for June 5 and it is unclear when voting will happen there.\n\nThe conflict is believed to have killed thousands of people, if not more and displaced more than one million, including some 60,000 who fled to neighbouring Sudan.\n\nIncreasing reports of mass killings, rape and widespread hunger have prompted international alarm and pressing calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops, who have been implicated in some of the worst attacks on civilians documented so far, including brutal gang rapes. Eritrea denies involvement in atrocities.\n\nOver the weekend, Abiy\u2019s Council of Ministers approved a resolution classifying the TPLF as a \u201cterrorist\u201d group, dealing a blow to the prospect of peace talks.",

          "text": "A former Ugandan child solider who became a commander in a notorious rebel group has been jailed for war crimes.\n\nDominic Ongwen, now 45, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for crimes including murder, rape and torture.\n\nHe is the first former Ugandan child solider to be convicted and sentenced by the International Criminal Court.\n\nOngwen was abducted by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group when he was nine years old and eventually became a feared commander.\n\nHe was convicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in February on 61 of 70 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nThe crimes relate to attacks on four camps for internally displaced people in Uganda in 2004. More than 4,000 victims provided testimony in the case, which was heard in The Hague.\n\nOngwen was found guilty of sexual slavery, forced marriage and the rape of seven women who were abducted and placed into his household. These charges were in addition to murder, attempted murder and torture.\n\nAt the height of his time with the LRA, Ongwen \u2013 known as White Ant because his surname means \u201cborn at the time of the white ant\u201d \u2013 was the commander of the Sinia brigade and one of the most feared fighters in the rebel movement.\n\nHe turned himself in to US forces in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2015 \u2013 and they later handed him over to the Ugandan army.\n\nThe LRA was formed more than 30 years ago, operating in Uganda and neighbouring countries.\n\nLed by Joseph Kony, it became notorious for abducting thousands of children to use as soldiers or sex slaves, and for mutilating civilians.\n\nIn 2005, the LRA was forced out of Uganda by the army and the rebels went into what is now South Sudan. They eventually set-up camp in the border area with the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThey later moved to CAR where they acted more like a criminal outfit engaging in poaching and illegal mining.",

          "text": "A Chinese rocket, thought to be out of control, is set to crash back to Earth this weekend.\n\nSpace agencies are tracking debris from the Long March 5B, which last week launched the main module of China\u2019s first permanent space station into orbit. The roughly 100ft long stage, said to be the size of five buildings, would be among the biggest space debris to fall to Earth.\n\nExperts expect it to fall to Earth on Saturday buts ay it is impossible to know where exactly it will land as its speed makes it too unpredictable.\n\nChina\u2019s space agency has yet to say whether the rocket is being controlled or will make an out-of-control descent. But the Global Times newspaper, published by the Chinese Communist party, has claimed the rocket\u2019s \u201cthin-skinned\u201d aluminium-alloy exterior will easily burn up in the atmosphere, posing an extremely remote risk to people.\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University, said that the debris is most likely to fall in the ocean as that\u2019s what makes up most of Earth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people should take precautions. The risk that there will be some damage or that it would hit someone is pretty small \u2014 not negligible, it could happen \u2014 but the risk that it will hit you is incredibly tiny.\n\nThere is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area, as in May 2020, when pieces from another Chinese Long March 5B rocket rained down on the Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings, though no injuries were reported, McDowell said.\n\n\u201cAnd so I would not lose one second of sleep over this on a personal threat basis,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cThere are much bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s first space station, Tiangong-1, crashed into the Pacific in 2016 after Beijing confirmed it had lost control. In 2019 the space agency controlled the demolition of its second station, Tiangong-2, in the atmosphere.\n\nIn March debris from a Falcon 9 rocket launched by US company SpaceX fell to Earth in Washington and on the Oregon coast.",
