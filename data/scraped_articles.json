          "title": "Insecurity: A new leadership ethos is required",
          "text": "There is unanimous agreement that the cascading level of insecurity with boarding schools and universities reportedly closing down in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja for fear of attack has reached emergency proportions. Given that Niger State, the FCT\u2019s neighbour, now warehouses under duress Boko Haram settlements and flag, and with security institutions appearing overwhelmed, grandstanding is no longer possible or credible. Please note that tragedy such as the kidnap of one\u2019s relation or friend is overwhelmingly personal rather than governmental. Given that political marketing is increasingly sophisticated, it is possible for government\u2019s spokespersons to convey the appearance of normalcy even when all hell breaks loose.\n\nSo, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, can afford to tell us that kidnapping and banditry are state rather than federal offences. But those whose children are forced to vegetate in the kidnappers\u2019 den or who survive the murderous escapades of bandits will have a different perspective. A logical follow-up to Mohammed\u2019s statement would be to ask whether the states under the current security architecture possess the wherewithal to combat rising cases of kidnapping and banditry. Were there to have been a state police that is well-funded, the distinction between federal and state offences will not be merely academic. But alas! Years of dithering and dilly-dallying have continued to postpone the policy.\n\nOnly on Wednesday, the threat of a possible attack by Boko Haram on the National Assembly, hitherto unimaginable, took on a new dimension as some National Assembly members received notice from the dreaded terrorist organisation of such an attack. As The PUNCH (Thursday, May 6, 2021) narrated it, quoting a National Assembly member, \u201cI am already moving out of here. I will only be around when there is a major reason to do so. Nowhere is safe in the country anymore\u201d. If, as was noted earlier in this write-up, tragedy is personal, then, no one in the country today can or should rely on vague assurances that all is well. For, obviously, too many places that were believed to be secure have been violated by attacks of the insurgents or kidnappers. For example, knowing that I shuttle often between Ibadan and Ijebu Ode, several relations and friends have sent me urgent messages warning of the danger and folly of taking that road in view of the activities of killer-gangs.\n\nUndoubtedly, if anyone gets into a mishap, it might then be too late to regret taking official assurances seriously, especially in a situation where state governors with the paraphernalia of security have escaped assassination by the whiskers. However, this is the situation in which Nigeria finds itself today with no one seemingly able to provide solutions beyond tepid proclamations that all will be well. In search of answers to burning questions, many have zeroed in on what has been called a leadership crisis and how we got to this slippery crossroads, a replica of the famed forest of ghosts in Yoruba mythic literature. For instance, a few days back, a strange posting appeared on the platform of the Nigerian Political Science Association (South West) referring to a statement made by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), published in The Nation Newspaper of June 2, 2013, calling on the former President Goodluck Jonathan administration to stop the killing of and clamp down on members of the Boko Haram. Entitled, \u2018Buhari faults clampdown on Boko Haram members\u2019, the report reads in part \u201che (Buhari) accused the government of killing and destroying their (Boko Haram) houses while the Niger Delta militants are given special treatment\u201d.\n\nIt is possible that Buhari has denied making such a statement or indicating that he was misquoted. If this is indeed the case, then his publicists have a job to do to correct the impression that Buhari, only a few years ago spoke in defence of the sect. Be that as it may, one of the pertinent inferences is that civil society is rummaging anxiously, combing every nook and cranny to see why Nigeria has landed itself in the current terrible mess. Whatever answers are offered, there must be a fresh zeroing in on our political leadership in order to understand the depth of the current crisis given especially the often stated axiom that Boko Haram has to do with ideology and religious belief, and that some officials are sympathetic to their cause, however that cause is defined. Any fruitful inquiry will include the search for an explanation of the gap between official rhetoric and laidback action pinpointing why it has taken this long to bring down the insurgency in the North-East, banditry and kidnappings in nearly every part of the country. There is, for example, the theory that those who benefit from the surge in military spending and the associated feature of slush pay and overnight contracting will find every reason to prolong the war in order to reap maximum profit.\n\nClearly, the phenomenon of splendidly rich Generals feasting on enhanced defence spending did not end with the Jonathan administration; it has continued to flower under the current regime, especially when viewed in the context of the recent disclosure by the Minister for Finance, Zainab Ahmed, on the floor of the Senate that the defence budget has been given high priority in the release of funds. In this regard, persistent attention has been focused on the use of obsolete equipment by our soldiers in contrast to Boko Haram and the bandits which brandish superior firepower. Indeed, one of our senators said recently, \u201cI can be quoted, I have toured the military formations and I have yet to see a brand new AK47\u201d. Allegations of sabotage apart, has anyone bothered to find out the drivers of the unrelenting underequipping of our security institutions in the face of mortal threats?\n\nLeadership centred on getting results will not stop merely at budgetary allocations; it will monitor continuously to see whether the allocations are being gainfully and prudently utilised. The lack of monitoring capacity sometimes bordering on amnesia has constituted a huge drawback to the organisational culture of our institutions. Was it not a week or so ago that the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission published the astonishing discovery that several projects in the budgetary allocations of the last few years were duplicated? How about the recent disclosure that the military budgetary spending had not been audited in the last decade? There are also the futile efforts of the Auditor-General of the Federation to get our public institutions to answer queries raised by his department.\n\nPrayers are good but the Holy Books tell us that prayers in the absence of hard work will not avail. If our current travails must end quickly, we must learn to build a new leadership ethos in place of the current recycling of indolent habits and what political scientists Patrick Chabal and Jean-Pascal Daloz once called the \u2018instrumentalisation of disorder\u2019, in which the state is deliberately criminalised in order to yield windfall gains for those who hold it hostage.\n\nFinally, a new leadership culture must of necessity leverage the power and pedigree of our civil society to renew a state in search of a compass, redirection and fulfilment of the social contract.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said that the state is working out a partnership with the Lagos State Government on rice production, which may see about N10bn investments over the next four years.\n\nInaugurating the state\u2019s agricultural subsidy scheme in Ilorin on Wednesday, Abdulrazaq said at least 10,000 farmers would have access to various subsidised inputs at 50 per cent of the market prices, which he noted aligned with the government\u2019s strategic plan for food security and sustainable development.\n\nThe governor told farmers that the intervention became necessary to compensate for their loss to the COVID-19 pandemic during the last farming season and to boost food production in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis initiative is part of the administration\u2019s sustained efforts to use agriculture to drive economic growth and food security in the post COVID-19 pandemic era. I assure you that mechanisms have been put in place, especially reliable data, to ensure that these inputs get only to the intended farmers.\n\n\u201cThis programme is basically to improve productivity. We have to bring this subsidy, because our farmers went through a lot of hardship last year with COVID-19. So, we needed to step in to enable them to get fertilisers, improved seedlings and herbicides to boost production.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about food security in Kwara State, but in Nigeria as a whole. Farmers are farming largely without any problem in Kwara. We only need to support them. The aim is to achieve food security in Nigeria, not just in Kwara, from animal husbandry to all other facets of agriculture.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cWe have the land. We are negotiating with some states, especially Lagos. Lagos has arguably the biggest rice mill in Nigeria today, but it doesn\u2019t have land. We want to take advantage of that and we are talking in that direction to have a MoU. And then, the Federal Government is working with us. We are working on the special agro processing zone to be located in Lata, which will see the investment of about N10bn going to agriculture in the Edu and Patigi local government areas alone in the next two to four years; so we need to scale up what we are doing in those areas.\n\n\u201cThis subsidy scheme gives our farmers easy access to certified seeds, assorted fertilisers and herbicides for the 2021 planting season at 50 per cent of the market prices.\u201d\n\nHe urged the farmers to make good use of the opportunity to have a more rewarding farming experience this year, adding that the efforts would lead to better outcomes and improved livelihood across the state.\n\nKwara State House of Assembly Committee Chairman on Agriculture, Ojo Olayiwola, commended the state government for placing high premium on the agricultural sector with several support schemes to farmers in the state.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The conflicted notion that the Buhari government might have been in sympathy with the Boko Haram sect have necessitated the aggressiveness that spawned other violent regional groups to action. The Boko Haram is operating with sophisticated military weapons. They seem to have escalated their insurgency from herdsmen killing of local farmers and raping their women to kidnapping of college students and demanding humongous ransom for their release.\n\nThe Southeast and Southwest are also boiling with the actions of militarized groups killing security officials, citizens and burning police stations. Vigilante groups in the Southwest are fighting to stop the marauding Fulani herdsmen from coming into their communities. The herdsmen are notorious for letting their cows devour crops and killing and raping farmers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nActivist groups in the Southeast have mobilized to create a counterforce to defend what they believe is their regional interest. Their operatives attack military personnel and policemen and outgun and kill them. There have been numerous instances of navy officials and police men being killed by these unknown gunmen. They attack police stations and burn down their buildings.\n\nThis atrocious level of violence is taking place currently in the country and the presence of government is not seen by the people. Most highways that are littered with checkpoints by police men and other military forces are deserted. Not that the people miss the corrupt officials who are mostly at the checkpoints to collect bribe, there is still a need for the law enforcement officials to checkmate crime.\n\nNigeria has suffered historically from myopic ethnic and religious leadership but never a time in her existence as a country has bigotry prevailed on the people like it is presently. The president is outrageously insensitive to the reflection of the federal character policy.\n\nThe country appears to be out of control of the government. The president has failed to set a leadership that will trickle down to the annals of the regional administrations. His perceived ethno/religious bias has impacted on his ability to administer a fair leadership. It might even be argued that the administration has enabled violence in the country by its failure to go after the killer herdsmen and the insurgent Boko Haram sect. The general ineptitude of the administration has made it possible for the flow of automatic weapons into the country and to the hands of angry groups who are protesting against poor governance and it has crippled the power of the government to protect the citizenry.",
          "summary": "Where it started mostly in the North-east with the violence by the Boko Haram Islamic sect, it is now occurring in different parts of the country.\nThe conflicted notion that the Buhari government might have been in sympathy with the Boko Haram sect have necessitated the aggressiveness that spawned other violent regional groups to action.\nThe Boko Haram is operating with sophisticated military weapons.\nThe Southeast and Southwest are also boiling with the actions of militarized groups killing security officials, citizens and burning police stations.\nIt might even be argued that the administration has enabled violence in the country by its failure to go after the killer herdsmen and the insurgent Boko Haram sect.",

You know they threatened to kill all of them (students) after a particular deadline but after talking to them, they are now lowering their bar.\n\n\u201cSo, we are thankful they have stopped killing. And we are still negotiating with them. I hope this Afaka case will also encourage them to know that there is hope in negotiation and release the children.\u201d\n\nRead Also: The Sheikh Gumi terrorism paradox\n\nSpeaking on his role in the release of the 27 Afaka students, Gumi said: \u201cThe role myself and former President Olusegun Obasanjo played in the release of the 27 Afaka students is the role of mediators because the fight is not between us and them but between the bandits and the government.\n\n\u201cWhat we understand is that these people were trying to attack the government by attacking the government institutions and take innocent children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHaving understood that, we came to the conclusion that, this is not a hopeless situation. We can really go in and negotiate for the release of these children which we did after so much ups and downs.\n\n\u201cBut in the long run, a conclusion was reached and these children are out. So, we are happy that, all of them are out and none was killed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the reported swap of a bandit for the students, Sheikh Gumi said: \u201cI cannot confirm that but I can quote the Governor of Kaduna when the children of Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cHe said it is the duty of the government to use whatever means possible to save the lives of Chibok girls. This is a general rule that life is more precious. Now, I am happy that, 27 lives have been saved.\u201d\n\nThe Afaka parents were led by their chairman and spokesman, Usman Abdullahi and Friday Sanni.\n\nThey thanked the Islamic cleric and begged him to help convey their appreciation to former President Obasanjo who worked alongside the cleric to bring back their children from captivity.",

Ejike Mbaka. has said he was not arrested or detained by security agents.\n\nThe cleric, who arrived to a rousing welcome at the Adoration Ground around 7:15pm told faithful he was invited to a meeting with the Bishop of Enugu Catholic Diocese, Callistus Onaga, where he was ordered to vacate the adoration ground and remain silent for 30 days.\n\nHe said he was surprised to see other persons at the meeting which he thought was only between him and the Bishop.\n\nHe said there was a plan to shut the adoration ground over his recent comments against the government.\n\n\u201cThey ordered me to leave the Adoration Ground for 30 days; to be silent for 30 days and to leave Enugu. Their plan was to even send me to Rome after the 30 days.\n\n\u201cI asked them why I was being punished. They cannot not tell me who to bless. They are angry that I blessed Nnamdi Kanu. I am a priest of God and nobody can tell me who to bless. Is it your blessing? Are you the one giving him life? Are you the one giving him life? Go and take away God\u2019s blessings from him.\n\n\u201cIf you said I spoke against government is there no insecurity in the country? Are they angry that I said government should provide jobs for the youths? I am a priest of God and I will continue to bless and speak the truth.\n\n\u201cI saw the implication of keeping me there. I told them that my people will look for me if they don\u2019t allow me to attend today\u2019s programme (E no dey again).\n\n\u201cWhat would have happened if I had has left Enugu as they instructed? We are a people of peace so I want you all to be peaceful. We wilI meet here again on Sunday God willing.\u201d\n\nPandemonium had broken out, yesterday, as thousands of adherents took to the streets seeking the whereabouts of the fiery priest.\n\nHis followers had stormed the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Bishop Callistus Onaga, demanding his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to the protesters, Bishop had invited Mbaka for a meeting by 10am on Tuesday and they had neither seen nor heard from him since then.\n\nThe cleric, however, showed up at about 2:50pm as tension was reaching a breaking point on his whereabouts with many alleging that government was complicit in his \u2018disappearance\u2019.\n\nHe emerged at the junction of Igboeze Street where he alighted from an SUV and urged protesters to return to Adoration Ground in Umuchigbo for him to address them. It was learnt that the priest may have emerged from the Government House axis of Enugu.\n\nEyewitnesses said having received no positive response and fearing that the bishop may have handed the priest to security agents, the protesters had descended on Bishop\u2019s Court, residence of Bishop Onaga, and vandalised property, especially glasses, doors, the Bishop\u2019s office before marching to destroy a bookshop, guest house, two buildings, four big water tanks and other facilities at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Some workers there sustained various degrees of injury.\n\nThere was heavy presence of joint security forces of the army, police, National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services both at the Bishop\u2019s Court and the Holy Ghost Cathedral.\n\nDSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, had denied that Mbaka was in their custody.\n\nFears of his possible arrest arose as Mbaka last week Wednesday called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over worsening security challenges in the country.\n\nLast Sunday, the DSS issued a warning to individuals and groups to be mindful of utterances and actions that threatened the country\u2019s peace and sovereignty.",

There\u2019s some agreement, grey areas have been cleared and I think the minister is committed to putting a meeting together with the workers and in the next couple of days. I think all the grey areas will be sorted out.\n\n\u201cSome of the grey areas for the judiciary, for instance, is that it is clear to all the parties now that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will be handling that because that\u2019s the position of the constitution. They have been doing that for recurrent at the state level, but have not been doing it for capital spending.\n\n\u201cThat will continue, especially for courts of record. The governors will be in charge of customary courts and magistrates courts.\n\n\u201cFor the legislature, the major issue was whether the deduction should be based on gross or net. What they have agreed is that it is going to be an agreed percentage of appropriated amount.\u201d\n\nFollowing the different positions adopted by the federal government and the governors, Ngige had urged the governors to rework the agreement for negotiations to resume.\n\nThe governors had accepted in principle the funding of both the state legislatures and judiciaries from their allocations from the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), to be deducted from the States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC).\n\nAs part of its implementation, the state governments were expected from May 1, to set up the States Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC) with members from the states Assembly committee chairmen on Finance and the States Commissioners of Finance to discuss on monthly basis the disbursement of funds.\n\nHowever, the governors and speakers could not reach a consensus on how much to be given to each state legislature monthly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges release of kidnapped Greenfield university scholars\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed excitement at the news of the release of the remaining 29 students of the Federal College of Forestry, Afaka, Kaduna abducted from their school 55 days ago.\n\nChairman of the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students, Mr. Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the release of the students to THISDAY.\n\n\u201cYes, they have been released. They did not sleep in the (bandits) camp yesterday. They were taken to the residence of one of the mediators to sleep. We have already sent our people with vehicles and ambulances to go and bring them. We are expecting them any moment from now,\u201d Usman said.\n\nThe bandits had invaded the school on March 11 and abducted 39 of the students.\n\nThey later freed 10 of them in two batches of five after the parents had reportedly paid N17 million ransoms.\n\nUsman described the release of the students as \u201ca big relief to parents,\u201d who have been emotionally traumatised since the incident.\n\nThe parents had on Tuesday protested at the National Assembly in Abuja.\n\nHowever, attempts to confirm the release of the students from the police were unsuccessful as Mr. Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command was unreachable on the telephone.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the release of the students was nearly frustrated following a claim by one of the parents during their protest in Abuja on Tuesday that they paid N800, 000 to one of the mediators.\n\nA source among the parents told THISDAY that the claim by the woman that they paid N800, 000 to an associate of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi nearly stalled the negotiation process.\n\nHe said the allegation angered Gumi and others helping to ensure the release of the students and they were not taking their calls.\n\nAccording to him, the woman was not part of the meeting with Gumi and wondered how she got such unfounded information.\n\nThe woman had said that the parents were taken to Gumi, who directed them to a Fulani man named Ahmed.\n\nShe said the parents paid N800, 000 to the man but the man said the money was for transportation and insisted that they should pay an additional N500 million.\n\nHowever, the source who said he was part of the negotiations, stated that the woman made her comments out of ignorance.\n\n\u201cThat woman made that unfortunate comment out of ignorance. It is just side talks. She was not at the meeting with Gumi; so, she didn\u2019t know what happened at the meeting. She just heard what some people are talking about at the corner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe parents of the 39 students later issued a statement dismissing the claims that they gave out N800, 000 to the Fulani man, who was recommended by Gumi.\n\nIn the statement issued in Kaduna, the parents said: \u201cThe claim has no basis.\u201d\n\nThe statement jointly signed Mr. Abdullahi Usman and Ms. Catherine Saleh, Chairman and Secretary respectively of the parents\u2019 union, also apologised to Gumi, \u201cfor any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement said though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, \u201cher claim is untrue,\u201d, as she was not a member of the (negotiation) committee representing the parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\u201d\n\nBuhari Excited\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari expressed happiness with the release of the students yesterday.\n\nHe also pleaded with the kidnappers to effect the release of the abducted students of Greenfield University also in Kaduna and other Nigerians being held in captivity.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, congratulated the released students\u2019 friends, families and the government and people of Kaduna State following the happy end to the saga.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are happy they have been released,\u201d while also expressing deep appreciation to all the actors who contributed one way or the other to the happy outcome, \u201cin particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State. We thank Nigerians for their prayers.\u201d\n\nHe called for steadfastness and security awareness on the part of citizens and the law enforcement agencies and deplored the increasing politicization of security in the country by opportunistic politicians.\n\nHe appealed for the release of the students of Greenfield University and all other citizens held in captivity, expressing the strong determination of his administration to ensure that Nigerians lived in a country where everyone can move where they want, when they want without the fear of kidnapping and banditry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Elumelu Calls for Urgent Power Sector Reforms to Boost Economy",
          "text": "\u2022Commends CBN on FX management\n\nBy Nume Ekeghe, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc Group Chairman and Founder, Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Mr. Tony Elumelu, has called for urgent reforms in the power sector to boost economic activities.\n\nElumelu, who is also the Chairman of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, also urged the federal government to invest more in electricity supply in order to create an avenue for innovation and economic development.\n\nHe spoke yesterday during an interview on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcasting arm of THISDAY Newspapers and lauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its foreign exchange management strategy as well as efforts to unify exchange rates.\n\nHe stressed the need for the federal government to focus on diversifying the economy in a bid to increase the country\u2019s forex inflow and reduce the dependence on oil revenue.\n\nAlso, responding to question on insider loan in companies he served as chairman, Elumelu stated that strict corporate governance are upheld in all the organisations.\n\nCommenting on the need for reforms in the power sector, he listed the three components of power supply as generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nHe said Nigerians would do better in business and creativity if they had steady electricity supply.\n\nHe decried the situation where inadequate electricity supply was crippling innovation and the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTranscorp through Transcorp Power and Afam Power today in Nigeria own the highest generating capacity in Nigeria that can generate 2,000 MW of electricity per day. But unfortunately, we do less than 500MW at this point in time and the major constraint in this area is gas; then there is the issue of transmission and there is the issue of payment.\n\n\u201cFor this to work well and for us to generate more, we need to have gas and our group has invested in oil and gas. And so, for us as a group, it is not necessarily for oil, it is because of gas because we want to be able to ensure that we have gas from our oil and gas production to convert to electricity.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition we did recently, I\u2019m happy to say, it is already supplying gas to our power plant. But going back to the subsidiary element, the issue of transmission, we need to make sure we stabilise our transmission for take-up.\u201d\n\nHe said Transcorp invested in the power sector to help Nigerians have access to electricity because businesses across all sectors of the economy like health, e-commerce, manufacturing, SMEs, among others, need power.\n\n\u201cThey cannot grow their businesses without adequate electricity.\n\nNigerian and African youths are multi-talented, but they need a steady electricity supply to be creative and innovative,\u201d he said.\n\nElumelu said if the government improves access to electricity in Nigeria, the Nigerian youths will create the Nigerian version of Silicon Valley and the likes of Steve Job and Bill Gates, explaining that what is holding Nigerian youths to a large extent is the lack of adequate electricity.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs at least 100,000 MW of electricity a day to power the economy but today we operate less than 5,000 MW and we need to do more,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGovernment, therefore, needs to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN and its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for the support given in the area of metering.\n\nHe said to drive the economy, power generation has to be increased by fixing the gas supply to generating companies, adding that there was the need to make sure that the transmission lines are utilised to evacuate the power as well as ensure that power generated is taken by Discos and the end-users and they pay.\n\nThe business mogul said: \u201cPower is still a critical sector; we need to invest and the stakeholders need to make sure that it works. And when it works, the country\u2019s economic development becomes more real.\n\n\u201cEvery sector of our economy needs the power sector and I think we need to prioritise it more. But I commend efforts going on and also by making sure we privatise the remaining ones. The transmission lines need to be fixed and we need to make sure we improve the payment system.\u201d\n\nHe advocated the privatisation of the entire value-chain of the power sector.\n\nElumelu stated: \u201cThe area of privatising the transmission lines, I think that ultimately, it should be privatised. What some of us have advocated is that the Gencos, the Discos and the entire power stakeholders should come together and have a deal with the federal government to take over the transmission lines and it would be in our self-interest to make sure it works.\n\n\u201cWe have the transmission lines and it doesn\u2019t work when you are generating, there is no way you would evacuate your power. That sector is so critical and pivotal for the survival of the power sector. It is critical to improving access to electricity, and where it is now there is no problem but what is important to us is that we have expanded capacity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the recent development at First Bank Nigeria Limited, Elumelu declined to make a comment.\n\nBut he said the decisions arrived at in resolving the board crisis in the bank were appropriate and beneficial to all major stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou need to understand the unique situation of this question. I am chairman of a competing institution and it may not be prudent for me to express a judgment or comment on this because it may not be very professional of me.\n\n\u201cBut I know the shareholders of the bank, and I also know the regulatory mindset, and the regulators want a safe banking environment and I believe the shareholders also seek that in due course, I believe they would be able to resolve the issues. I must say the banking sector has done very well, both the regulatory part and the participants.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on if UBA is exposed to insider trading and lending with his other businesses, he stated that his oil and gas interests were financed by a consortium of local and international banks, excluding UBA.\n\nIn addition, his other ventures have exposure below the threshold and the loans are serviced.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe oil and gas acquisition we just made, UBA did not participate in the funding. It is a club of international and local lenders. The local receiving bank for our proceeds is Union Bank of Nigeria and the international receiving bank of our oil sales is Standard Chartered Bank, London.\n\n\u201cThe transaction was funded by consortium of banks \u2013 Standard Chartered, ABSA IN South Africa, Afrexim, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank in Nigeria and a host of other international banks. So, we are mindful of all this and we are very prudent in making sure we do not put pressure on the bank.\n\n\u201cWe also put in equity investment and when we need to get investment, we try not to put pressure on the institution. What is important is that it is within the limit UBA should be exposed to a company and it is by the way performing very well. Our loans are performing very well.\u201d\n\nOn CBN forex management strategy, Elumelu said he supported efforts being made by the regulator to achieve convergence of rates.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo years ago, our vice president conveyed a meeting of a few of us to express our opinion and talk on the economy. The position then was quite critical at the time. But today, when things have improved, you should be also critical to say that things are moving in the right direction. On the convergence, I support it 100 per cent and I think we are there.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the saddle or seat you would see things more differently. For Nigeria, we generate foreign currency largely from oil. We used to produce around 2.5 million barrels before and today, we are doing 1.4 million barrels per day and that should have an impact on our foreign currency which is no rocket science.\n\n\u201cAlso, there was a time oil was $100 per barrel and it dropped to almost $40 per barrel and today it is at $69 per barrel. So, there is a basket of so many things we have to watch as economic managers in making decisions and there is a lot of pressure on our foreign currency.\n\n\u201cWhat people want to see from outside is a low exchange rate, but from the business world, people want to predict that this would be available and I think to a large extent, it is happening\n\nElumelu, who also spoke about the ease of doing business in Nigeria, said government must improve on its policy to attract more investors.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that investors, who are looking for where to invest their money, will go to countries where the policy on the ease of doing business is investor-friendly. The private sector must also work with government to ensure that the ease of doing business in Nigeria improves,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\nSpeaking on the impact of Tony Elumelu Foundation, Elumelu said it was established seven years ago to empower young Nigerians and Africans, stressing that the future of Africa remains in the hands of the youth who have key roles to play in developing Nigeria and the continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cI strongly feel it will be a waste of resources to save so much money in banks without using such money to empower people, especially when there is poverty among the masses. It is for this reason that we established Tony Elumelu Foundation to empower young people and make successful businesses out of them.\n\n\u201cEvery year, the foundation supports young people with a seed capital of $5,000 each, which is non-refundable and the foundation supports 1,000 people every year. We train them for 12 weeks and appoint business mentors for them and we create a networking platform for them to interact and grow their business ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the foundation gets support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union, stressing that the EU recently released $25 million.\n\nHe said the fund would be used for the next batch of trainees.\n\nElumelu stated that about 10, 000 Nigerians, including other Africans, have benefited from the training offered by the Tony Elumelu Foundation in the last seven years.\n\nOn the issue of girl-child education, Elumelu said there was a need to close the gap on gender inequality.\n\n\u201cI am a direct beneficiary of women\u2019s impact in molding the society, through the training I received from my mother, and cherish to support the girl-child education in order to bridge gender inequality,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nGiving details of his exit from UBA as managing director and chief executive officer, Elumelu said the orders came from the then CBN Governor, Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who felt that all bank CEOs that had served for 10 years, should step aside at that time.\n\n\u201cThat day, we had a Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting and at the end of the meeting, the then CBN Governor, Lamido Sanusi, told me that CEOs who had done 10 years will step aside. I called the chairman to explain what happened and the next day, we conveyed an emergency board meeting. At the board meeting, it was a divided household for the first time; some directors said \u2018no, we have to go to court to contest it\u2019 and about one or two other directors did not think so. But I spoke and I told the board members that there are five critical stakeholders here \u2013 the customers of UBA \u2013 will they like to know that we took our regulator to court? No, then the staff of UBA; will they be comfortable working in a bank that took their regulator to court? No, then the shareholders, then the regulators themselves, they wouldn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cSo, four constituents will not like us going to court. There is only one constituent that may like it and that\u2019s Tony Elumelu, which makes it one over five, and that is 20 per cent, and it\u2019s not enough to go to court,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, however, said he was already planning to exit as the bank\u2019s CEO at the age of 50, before the directive came, adding that within 24 hours of CBN directive, the bank appointed his successor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Paystack, a fintech company that powers growth and payments for businesses in Africa, today announced its official launch in South Africa after a six-month pilot. The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "Is there a ride-hailing service in Gabon? Yes, Gozem just launched there this week.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Emeka Ajene and Raphael Dana, Gozem operates an app that offers transportation, logistics, e-commerce and financial services in primarily-francophone African countries.\n\nGozem is aiming to be the super app for Africa and is modelled after the success of Gojek and WeChat in Southeast Asia and China respectively. While it is only one of many super app candidates in Africa, geographic expansion is a signal of strong intent.\n\nUntil the rollout in Gabon, Gozem was only available in cities across Togo and Benin, offering motorcycle taxis, tricycle taxis, and delivery of groceries, gas bottles, and meals.\n\nThe company says it has more than 500,000 registered users who have completed more than 2.5 million trips since inception.\n\nGabon will be Gozem\u2019s first operation outside of West Africa. The Central African country\u2019s population is under 2.5 million with almost 75% under the age of 30.\n\nScreenshots of the Gozem app. Image source: Gozem.\n\nThe ride-hailing feature is the only service Gabonese users will find on the app at the moment and it is only available in Libreville, the capital city.\n\n\u201cOur immediate focus is on providing a high-quality, reliable taxi service in that city, and then expanding the range of services we offer to Libreville\u2019s population,\u201d Ajene, Gozem co-founder and CEO, said to TechCabal.\n\nLaunching a taxi service in Gabon helps the company \u201cdiversify away from our beginnings as a 100% motorcycle-taxi oriented platform.\u201d\n\nWith Libreville in the mix, Gozem now operates in 10 cities across West and Central Africa. Ajene notes that most are not capital cities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed an in-house capability to operate effectively in secondary cities in the region and there are one or two additional cities that you might ultimately see Gozem operating in in Gabon,\u201d he said.\n\nOne point of curiosity in this expansion is that Gabon is a smaller country by population compared to Togo (~8 million) and Benin (~ 12 million). Ajene acknowledges that but explains that purchasing power is another consideration that bears on expansion plans.\n\n\u201cGabon is quite attractive as it\u2019s a wealthier country as measured by GDP than our existing markets, and it\u2019s significantly wealthier as measured by GDP per capita,\u201d Ajene said.\n\nIndeed, Gabon\u2019s 2020 GDP per capita was estimated to be $7,185, more than thrice the sum of Benin\u2019s $1,259 and Togo\u2019s $690.\n\n\n\nGozem\u2019s ride-hailing offering will work in Gabon like a standard app-enabled taxi booking service. Users download, sign up and input their destination to request rides. Driver accepts and the fare is calculated by distance. Users can pay in cash, with Airtel Money or Moov Money, or by credit card.\n\nRaphael Dana, Gozem co-founder, says the launch responds to the needs of the Gabonese population and aligns with Gozem\u2019s long-term plan to organise transport and commerce in Africa around the ongoing smartphone and internet revolution.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to consolidate our status as the premier super app in Africa, and this expansion to Central Africa, our first foray outside of West Africa, also allows us to prepare our upcoming expansion to Cameroon,\u201d Dana said.\n\nThe expansion to Cameroon is on the calendar for this year; DR Congo is also being explored. Beyond moving into new countries to enable taxis however, Gozem plans to make its other verticals compete with incumbents in the markets they currently operate.\n\n\u201cWe have robust food & e-commerce delivery verticals, we\u2019re beginning to see a significant impact coming from our vehicle financing vertical as well, and our plans for our full-service wallet are still on track,\u201d Ajene said.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nComments",

          "text": "PHILIP CLEMENT, ABUJA\n\nContrary to reports insinuating that the federal government is cutting salaries of workers, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed said the government is rather mulling salary harmonisation.\n\nThe rationale behind the harmonization is due to the fact that there are some government agencies paying much higher than others, for staff on the same grade level.\n\nTherefore, the government, according to Mrs.Ahmed, is seeking more of pay parity.\n\nShe disclosed at the ongoing \u2018National Policy Dialogue on Corruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practice Commission (ICPC) in Abuja on Tuesday that the President had directed the salaries committee to review payroll and also review the number of agencies.\n\n\u201cWhat government hopes to achieve is to redistribute wages equally across board. Let us bring our salary structure within government agencies as close or as equitable and fair.\n\n\u201cwhat we seek to achieve is to create fairness and equity and to reduce cost\u201d With this readjustment, when finally done, workers in the public service will earn a fair and equitable wages,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nThe government had approved a N13.88trillion budget with a deficit of over N5.6trillion, and projected a revenue of N7.98trillion to fund part of the 2021 budget.\n\nThe Minister urged that all agencies must come together to trim their costs, given Nigeria\u2019s dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the government would also remove some unnecessary items from the budget as a move to cut the cost of governance in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe need to work together, all agencies of the government to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures. Expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year in year out with projects that we see over and over again, and also projects that are not necessary.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed that the salaries committee, which I chair, work together with the head of service (HOS) and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls considering stepping down on cost.\u201d\n\nShe revealed that the government would also review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates. Ahmed disclosed that for agencies with the same mandate, the government would look at merging the two.\n\nThe Chairman of ICPC, Mr. Bolaji Owasanoye, noted during the stakeholders meeting, that the cost of governance is the \u201cdriver of corruption in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said that the government had committed to improving the country\u2019s revenue from new and existing sources.\n\nOwasanoye said that the government\u2019s commitment to streamline payroll, removal of subsidies and reduction of the cost of contracts and procurement are all for the benefits of the poor and vulnerable.\n\nHe also said that a critical area of concern was he called \u2018payroll padding\u2019 and the \u2018phenomenon of ghost workers.\u2019\n\nThe ICPC boss lamented the duplication of projects such as the constituency projects of lawmakers, and noted that funding for such projects was usually released without any mechanism for monitoring and evaluation and reconciliation of the funding.",

          "text": "**We paid bandits through Sheikh Gumi \u2013 Mother alleges\n\n**lt\u2019s not true, other parents declare\n\nIdibia Gabriel, Kaduna\n\nControversy ensued yesterday as a mother of one of the abducted 29 students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, Kaduna State, made a stunning revelation against the Sheikh Mahmud Gumi, saying they contributed and paid N800,000 to the bandits through him.\n\nMeanwhile, news filtered in late yesterday that 29 of the students have been released.\n\nThe student\u2019s mother who revealed that the Afaka 39 parents contributed and paid the money to a Fulani man through Gumi for the release of their children however had her allegations immediately refuted and described as untrue by the other parents\u2019 representative in a statement on Wednesday in Kaduna.\n\nThe statement signed by the representative committee Chairman and Secretary, Malam Abdullahi Usman and Mrs Catherine Y. Saleh maintained that the claim was untrue.\n\nThe statement reads in parts: \u201cThe attention of the parents of the 39 abducted Afaka students has been drawn to a screaming headline in today\u2019s (May 5, 2021) publication of Roots TV to the effect that one of us (name withheld), who spoke to them in a live interview, claimed that we, the parents of the abducted students, contributed and paid the sum of N800,000 naira to a Fulani man through Sheikh Gumi for the release of our children.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state in no unclear terms that the claim has no basis in fact. Though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, but her claim is untrue.\n\nThe woman is not a member of the committee representing the affected parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the Forum of the Abducted Parents has never gathered money and given to Gumi or to someone through the revered Islamic scholar at anytime. We therefore dissociate ourselves from the statement.\n\nThe committee considers the statement as unfortunate and an unnecessary distraction from its commitment to secure the release of their children who have now spent 56 days in captivity.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the committee representing the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students visited the home of Sheikh Gumi to seek his intervention for the release of our children, but he declined, on the grounds that as a law-abiding citizen he would not want to go against the position of the state government which has forbidden anyone to negotiate with bandits.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the esteemed Sheikh for any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\n\n\u201cAgain we call on all to join their voices in calling on government at state and federal levels to work extra hard to ensure the safe release of our children so that they may be reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cWhile we await God\u2019s intervention for the release of our children, we call on all people of goodwill to join us in prayers as we continue to seek God\u2019s help for the release of our children,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, circumstances surrounding the release of the students remain unclear.\n\nThe students were kidnapped in March, but 11 were earlier freed.\n\nOne of the affected parents confirmed that they were released at a village in Giwa Local Government Area of the state and that they were on their way to Kaduna, as at the time of going to press.\n\nThe Kaduna Police Command has reported to the State Government, the release of the remaining students, the second security update, Wednesday revealed.\n\nAccording to a statement by internal security and Home Affairs commissioner, Mr Samuel Aruwan, the government rejoices with the freed students, their families and the management of the institution over this development.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai charged them to view their ordeal as a motivator to put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead.

You know they threatened to kill all of them (students) after a particular deadline but after talking to them, they are now lowering their bar.\n\n\u201cSo, we are thankful they have stopped killing. And we are still negotiating with them. I hope this Afaka case will also encourage them to know that there is hope in negotiation and release the children.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his role in the release of the 27 Afaka students, Gumi said: \u201cThe role myself and former President Olusegun Obasanjo played in the release of the 27 Afaka students is the role of mediators because the fight is not between us and them but between the bandits and the government.\n\n\u201cWhat we understand is that these people were trying to attack the government by attacking the government institutions and taking innocent children.\n\n\u201cHaving understood that, we came to the conclusion that this is not a hopeless situation. We can really go in and negotiate for the release of these children which we did after so much ups and downs.\n\n\u201cBut in the long run, a conclusion was reached and these children are out. So, we are happy that all of them are out and none were killed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the reported swap of a bandit for the students, Sheikh Gumi said: \u201cI cannot confirm that but I can quote the Governor of Kaduna when the children of Chibok were kidnapped by Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cHe said it is the duty of the government to use whatever means possible to save the lives of Chibok girls. This is a general rule that life is more precious. Now, I am happy that 27 lives have been saved.\u201d\n\nThe Afaka parents were led by their chairman and spokesman, Usman Abdullahi and Friday Sanni.\n\nThey thanked the Islamic cleric and begged him to help convey their appreciation to former President Obasanjo who worked alongside the cleric to bring back their children from captivity.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians to participate in the ongoing synchronization of National Identification Number (NIN) with SIM cards across the country, as it will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy.\n\nThe President stated this at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration in Abuja.\n\nHe said \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari noted that proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database will provide an impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\n\u201cThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was quite timely and will support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies were in full alignment with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security, and anti-corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Digital Economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 percent double-digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, the ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 percent. This is truly commendable,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the digital economy sector provided online options for activities that were hitherto restricted to offline channels while minimizing the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe added that the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government embraced institutionalizing online meetings through the approval of the National Policy on Virtual Engagements in Federal Public Institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements, and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the Policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past: \u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe assured that his administration was fully committed to the safety of Nigerians and linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid in national planning and budget preparations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy appreciated the President for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nThe minister noted that the NIN Registration had recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, adding, \u201cwithin six months over 12 million enrolled.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr Pantami said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that can be used in various transactions, assuring that the NIN and Sim card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 percent.\n\nHe said the buoyancy of the telecoms sector had given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health, and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world-class sim card manufacturing company in the country.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s federal government has replaced the head of the interim administration of Tigray, a region racked by more than six months of catastrophic conflict.\n\nMulu Nega had held the position since November, shortly after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military campaign against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), the northern region\u2019s ruling party that had dominated national politics for decades.\n\nMulu was replaced by Abraham Belay, who had been serving as minister of innovation and technology in the federal government, Abiy\u2019s office said in a Twitter post on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe appointment is a result of a six-month performance review of the role,\u201d Abiy\u2019s spokeswoman Billene Seyoum said. Abraham is a member of Abiy\u2019s Prosperity Party.\n\nAbiy said on November 4 he was sending troops into Tigray after accusing the TPLF of orchestrating attacks on federal army camps. The TPLF, which was at the helm of Ethiopia\u2019s governing coalition for nearly 30 years until Abiy took office in 2018, denied responsibility and said the reported attack was a pretext for an \u201cinvasion\u201d by federal forces and allied troops from neighbouring Eritrea.\n\nAfter federal troops took the regional capital Mekelle in November, Mulu set about trying to establish an interim government even as fighting raged elsewhere in the region.\n\nIn an interview in February, he said he knew Mekelle residents had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about his presence in the office formerly occupied by their overthrown leaders.\n\nHe said he was happy in the job but did not want to stay on for long, and that he was planning to leave after elections are held in Tigray. The region will not take part in national elections planned for June 5 and it is unclear when voting will happen there.\n\nThe conflict is believed to have killed thousands of people, if not more and displaced more than one million, including some 60,000 who fled to neighbouring Sudan.\n\nIncreasing reports of mass killings, rape and widespread hunger have prompted international alarm and pressing calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops, who have been implicated in some of the worst attacks on civilians documented so far, including brutal gang rapes. Eritrea denies involvement in atrocities.\n\nOver the weekend, Abiy\u2019s Council of Ministers approved a resolution classifying the TPLF as a \u201cterrorist\u201d group, dealing a blow to the prospect of peace talks.",

More than 4,000 victims provided testimony in the case, which was heard in The Hague.\n\nOngwen was found guilty of sexual slavery, forced marriage and the rape of seven women who were abducted and placed into his household. These charges were in addition to murder, attempted murder and torture.\n\nAt the height of his time with the LRA, Ongwen \u2013 known as White Ant because his surname means \u201cborn at the time of the white ant\u201d \u2013 was the commander of the Sinia brigade and one of the most feared fighters in the rebel movement.\n\nHe turned himself in to US forces in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2015 \u2013 and they later handed him over to the Ugandan army.\n\nThe LRA was formed more than 30 years ago, operating in Uganda and neighbouring countries.\n\nLed by Joseph Kony, it became notorious for abducting thousands of children to use as soldiers or sex slaves, and for mutilating civilians.\n\nIn 2005, the LRA was forced out of Uganda by the army and the rebels went into what is now South Sudan. They eventually set-up camp in the border area with the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThey later moved to CAR where they acted more like a criminal outfit engaging in poaching and illegal mining.",

          "text": "A Chinese rocket, thought to be out of control, is set to crash back to Earth this weekend.\n\nSpace agencies are tracking debris from the Long March 5B, which last week launched the main module of China\u2019s first permanent space station into orbit. The roughly 100ft long stage, said to be the size of five buildings, would be among the biggest space debris to fall to Earth.\n\nExperts expect it to fall to Earth on Saturday buts ay it is impossible to know where exactly it will land as its speed makes it too unpredictable.\n\nChina\u2019s space agency has yet to say whether the rocket is being controlled or will make an out-of-control descent. But the Global Times newspaper, published by the Chinese Communist party, has claimed the rocket\u2019s \u201cthin-skinned\u201d aluminium-alloy exterior will easily burn up in the atmosphere, posing an extremely remote risk to people.\n\nJonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University, said that the debris is most likely to fall in the ocean as that\u2019s what makes up most of Earth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people should take precautions. The risk that there will be some damage or that it would hit someone is pretty small \u2014 not negligible, it could happen \u2014 but the risk that it will hit you is incredibly tiny.\n\nThere is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area, as in May 2020, when pieces from another Chinese Long March 5B rocket rained down on the Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings, though no injuries were reported, McDowell said.\n\n\u201cAnd so I would not lose one second of sleep over this on a personal threat basis,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cThere are much bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s first space station, Tiangong-1, crashed into the Pacific in 2016 after Beijing confirmed it had lost control. In 2019 the space agency controlled the demolition of its second station, Tiangong-2, in the atmosphere.\n\nIn March debris from a Falcon 9 rocket launched by US company SpaceX fell to Earth in Washington and on the Oregon coast.",
