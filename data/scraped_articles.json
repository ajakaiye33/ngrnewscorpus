          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Attacks Lagos CP, Hakeem Odumosu\n\nBy Arogbonlo Israel\n\nThe embattled leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has reacted to the allegation that the group is plotting an attack in Lagos.\n\nVanguard earlier reported that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, on Monday, May 10, said the state Police Command is investigating the separatist group, Oodua Republic, and also the threat by the proscribed IPOB to attack soft targets in the state.\n\nReacting, Kanu in a statement signed Tuesday, by his media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, described the allegation as \u201ca false alarm and a smoke screen by security operatives to commit terror and create division among IPOB and Oodua group \u201c.\n\nRead full statement below;\n\n\u201cWe the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has again come across another fallacious statement from a Commissioner of Police in Lagos, claiming to have uncovered plot by IPOB and Estern Security Network, ESN, to attack Lagos in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe therefore, wish to state that the purported statement by the CP is false alarm and a lie from the pit of hell which exists only in figment of his imagination. Neither IPOB nor ESN has any plans to attack Lagos or any part of Nigeria for any reason. We are not terrorists that attack targets.\n\n\u201cThe mandate of IPOB is to restore Biafra, while ESN defends our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen. None of these mandates can be achieved by attacking Lagos. Lagos is Oduduwa Republic and we enjoy robust relationship and synergy with our Oduduwa brethren. So, what is our gain in attacking Lagos assuming that attacks are part of our strategies?\n\n\u201cBased on our understanding of the antics of the federal government of Nigeria, we therefore, wish to put Lagosians on notice to be wary of this Government and its agencies. The purported statement by the CP is a smoke screen under which the security agencies want to hide and unleash mayhem on Lagos residents and turn around as usual to blame it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cThey want to divert attention and carry out an act of terror in Lagos just the same way they are doing currently in the Eastern region. They have been destabilizing Eastern region to pave the way for another special military operation in the region and kill more innocent Biafrans. After commiting their atrocities they still point accusing fingers at IPOB and ESN just to have more excuses to further clamp down on us.\n\n\u201cToday, they have been going from house to house abducting innocent Biafrans, tagging them IPOB, and ESN members and sponsors. Yet the murderous Fulani bandits and herdsmen have continued to unleash terror on Nigerians almost unchallenged. The shameless Nigeria security agencies who flee at the sight of bandits have been busy arresting innocent newspapers vendors in Imo State for commiting no crime other than selling newspapers that contain Biafra stories. But they began too late. They can\u2019t suppress Biafra any longer!\n\n\u201cThe antics of the enemies cannot stop our irrevocable resolve to restore Biafra. We also wish to remind the hypocritical Nigeria security agencies that they will pay dearly for any innocent Biafran they kill. This is a sure promise!\n\n\u201cWill the federal government swear that it does not know who brought the killer herdsmen into Nigeria through the porous Northern borders? Who negotiates with the bandits? Who pays them ransom? Why are they trying to change the narrative and divert attention now? IPOB is a peaceful movement and not a terror cell. Our peaceful disposition is the reason we maintain a global presence in over 100 countries. So, any attempt by Nigeria to blackmail us is dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

He speaks for the police high command in Abuja.\n\n2) While we cherish the responsibility of the police to do their work, we are concerned about the public declaration of the alleged IPOB plans to attack Lagos by the Nigerian Police\n\n3) We are worried that since the police already claimed to be in possession of what appears to be a confidential information, the proper thing would have been to discreetly go after the IPOB members to arrest them unless the police is not sure of its information.\n\n4) The police statement carries the possibility of being misinterpreted as an Igbo plot against Lagos and Yoruba people. This is dangerous given the fragile nature of Nigeria.\n\n5) We are deeply concerned that the Police publicly declared allegations tempts the prospect of setting Yoruba in the South West against Igbos. This is very unfortunate at a time that state institutions are increasingly being turned to instruments for pursuing primordial ethnic interests. The Yoruba will work never to allow this to happen\n\n6) We are concerned that terrorists and armed herdsmen of Fulani extraction have openly been attacking, kidnapping, raping and killing Yoruba people in the South West but at no time did the police call a press conference to announce such plan after before or after each horrendous killings. There was also never a time the police linked such attacks to any ethnic group.\n\n7) Only recently, Yoruba in Mile 2 were attacked by these people, the police did not make any attempt to speak about the ethnic identity of the perpetrators yet we know they are largely from a section in the North.\n\n8) We are concerned that the police allegation risks setting a greater danger of ethnic conflict between Igbo and Yoruba people, conscious that this will benefit a certain group who think setting Igbo against Yoruba will meet the objective of scuttling the search for peaceful self determination by the two great civilisations\n\n9) We urge the police not to allow themselves to be used by the desperate Caliphate whose agelong dream is to divide the South and set the people against each other for its own narrow gains\n\n10) We urge Yoruba people to ignore the conscious attempts to cause ethnic conflict between Igbo and Yoruba at this time that both ethnic groups need each other.\n\n11) The police should avoid ethnic profiling. It is dangerous. The Pan Yoruba groups assure of our collective desire to sustain peaceful coexistence between Igbo and Yoruba and avoid any slide into ethnic conflict, an ill wind that blows no one any good. To this end, we shall set up a Committee to work out a platform to sustain ethnic harmony in Lagos.\n\n12) On police plan to attack agitators for Yoruba self determination, We urge the police have respect for internation laws and should signify the basic democratic principle which is the right of a people to debate their political and economic future.\n\nSigned\n\n1) Femi Ajibola Oodua Nationalist Coalition, ONAC\n\n2) Dr Kunle Oshodi, Agbekoya\n\n3) Alhaji Taofik Adeyemi, Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC (Reformed)\n\n4) Chief Diran Obalola Oodua Liberation Movement, OLM\n\n5) Mr Femi Agbana Yoruba World Congress, (YWC-Lagos State Chapter)\n\n6) Mr Rasaq Arogundade, Oodua Peoples Congress, (OPC-Reformed)\n\n7) Mrs Eunice Okunola, Oodua Women Coalition, (OWC)\n\n8) Pastor Goke Otunla, Network for Yoruba Alliance, (NENA)\n\n9) Ahmed Korede Apapo Oodua Koya, (AOKOYA)\n\nMeanwhile, Nnamdi Kanu, through the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, has urged the public to disregard Odumosu\u2019s pronouncement, saying that is an intention to fuel division between Yorubas and the Igbos, \u201cIt won\u2019t work.

          "title": "Seven ways to stay safe during rains",
          "text": "By Oladeji Adeola\n\nRain is one of the crucial elements in the Earth\u2019s water cycle, which Is vital to all life on Earth. Rainwater provides a habitat for fish to live and nourishes the soil with enough water for vegetation.\n\nThe rainy season can be pleasant sometimes; the cool weather, the perfect time to drink a cup of hot tea or coffee, a reason to wear coats and turtlenecks, enjoy snuggle time with loved ones but can also be irritating as it comes with illnesses such as flu, common cold, fever, malaria and others.\n\nThe Lagos government in April alerted residents that the state will experience normal rainfall for 238 to 261 days in 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFortunately, to stay safe during this period, there are some simple tips to adopt.\n\nHere are some tips to stay safe during the rainy season:\n\n1. AVOID GETTING SOAKED IN THE RAIN\n\nMake sure to always carry an umbrella and rain coat to avoid getting soaked from a sudden downpour. Getting soaked in the rain can cause flu,cold, cough and other rain causing illnesses.\n\nRain gears such as umbrellas, rain coats, rubber boots helps to protect you from getting soaked and shields you against cold or fever.\n\nWearing rubber boots is advisable to protect yourself against possible viruses and germs that could be in the water.\n\n2. WASH YOUR HANDS REGULARLY\n\nTo keep you from getting cold, cough and flu, regular hand washing is necessary to prevent the spread of viruses and bacteria. Bacterias and viruses come alive during the rainy season and you can come in contact with them anywhere.\n\nWash your hands as often as you can with soap and water. It is also advisable to carry a pocket-sized hand sanitiser with you when you go out.\n\nIt is important to wash your feet and hands when you get home, especially after contact with rain or flood.\n\n3. BE A WEATHER CONSCIOUS PERSON\n\nYou need to stay up to date with the latest news on weather and weather forecasts to avoid going out when there will be a heavy downpour. You can monitor the weather through Radio,TV and the internet.\n\nFollow accounts that share useful information about weather and traffic updates, which might help you to get rid of flooded areas and find alternate routes.\n\n4. AVOID TOUCHING ELECTRIC POLES AND WIRES\n\nStaying away from electric poles and wires is one of the most important safety measures for the rainy season. Do not touch wires that have fallen due to heavy rain or are dangling precariously from the pole.\n\nIf you see wires lying in a puddle of water after rain, stay away from it as far as possible since stepping in it can possibly electrocute you.\n\n5. KEEP MOSQUITOES AWAY\n\nRainy season is the perfect breeding season for mosquitoes. They lay their eggs in pools of stagnant water so you must make sure to sweep away any stagnant water that is around you.\n\nMosquito repellent spray should be used in the house,burn mosquito coils as well to keep the insects away.\n\nWhen you need to go outside,wear long sleeved shirts and rub mosquito repellent cream on your arms and legs. Use mosquito nets around your bed too.\n\n6. STAY WARM\n\nIt is usually cold outside when it rains,so wear warm clothes to keep your body temperature up.\n\nCardigans, sweaters, turtlenecks and coats should be part of clothing during this season. They help you stay warm and avoid catching a cold.\n\nRemember to stay out of the rain too if you can.\n\n7. TAKE A HOT SHOWER\n\nTaking a shower after getting drenched in the rain might sound absurd, however taking a hot shower will help raise your body temperature and also get rid of the germs and protect you from many infections but If you don\u2019t feel like having a shower, try soaking your feet in warm water.",

This include, the use of Okada as a veritable tool to commit crime and get away with it by hoodlums; disrespect to traffic rules and regulations; the Okada operators becoming nuisance and reckless on our roads, resulting into avoidable accidents with attendant consequences on human life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was attended by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, security chiefs and members of the public.\n\nMeanwhile, Lagosians have asked the state government to take decisive actions on some security issues to rein in what they describe as a disturbing trend.\n\nAmong others, they demanded action against the menace of commercial motorcycles, otherwise known as Okada, kidnapping, armed robbery, cult clashes, and violent assaults.\n\nThey made the call at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on security held, yesterday, at the Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja, with governor Sanwo-Olu and other leading lights in attendance.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu listed his administration\u2019s efforts in security and assured his audience that a decisive action would be taken on commercial motorcycles.\n\nHe said the meeting was convened in response to the growing threat posed by some lawless activities to the safety and security of lives in the State.",

          "title": "How $1.5bn Channel Management, INTELS Contracts Pitted Amaechi against Bala-Usman",
          "text": "By Eromosele Abiodun\n\nLast week\u2019s suspension of Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, at the request of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, was the culmination of a two-year war of attrition between the duo, triggered by disagreement in 2019 over whether or not to renew the channel management contracts, THISDAY findings have shown.\n\nIt was learnt that the NPA had in 2019 placed advertisement in newspapers calling for expression of interest and bids.\n\nSources said three bid rounds were cancelled on the orders of the minister over disagreements on the selective bids and open bids.\n\nThe process was suspended till May 11, 2020, when the NPA placed advertisements calling for expression of interest, which was again moved to October 2020 because participants protested that they could not participate because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe channels in contention are: Lagos, Port Harcourt (Bonny) and Warri while Calabar is under litigation.\n\nEach channel management contract is valued at $100 million a year for five years making it $1.5 billion (N600 billion) for the three channels for the five years.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Amaechi had requested that two Chinese companies are selected to manage Bonny and Warri Channels, a request the NPA rejected because it violated due process.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that 12 companies submitted technical bids for Lagos Channel, 25 companies for Warri while 18 companies bid for Bonny.\n\nAt the end of the technical bid process, three companies were shortlisted for Bonny and Warri while two were selected for Lagos.\n\nFor the Warri Channel, Pelfaco Construction Nigeria Limited, Redstar and China Harbour (JV) and A.A Ranno were prequalified.\n\nFor Bonny, Bellsea Limited, CRBC and CDBHC Limited (JV) and Borno Energy Limited/Dact Energy (JV) were prequalified.\n\nJandnul Limited and Hankuff Services Nigeria Limited were prequalified for the Lagos Channel.\n\nThe companies prequalified submitted their commercial bids between January and February.\n\nCompetent sources at the Bureau of Public Procurement told THISDAY that three company\u2019s commercial bids were accepted as winners.\n\nThey are: Redstar Limited for Warri, Bellsea Limited for Bonny and Hancuff Services Limited for Lagos.\n\nThe battle between Amaechi and Bala-Usman further heightened this year when Amaechi wrote a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari requesting that INTELS Pilotage contract, which expired last year, be restored.\n\nIn a letter to Buhari in January 2021, Amaechi requested the restoration of all contracts between NPA and INTELS, which according to him, are now subject to legal disputes between the parties.\n\nThe minister also requested the withdrawal of all matters currently in court or at arbitration by both parties in order to enable him to resolve all pending issues \u2018administratively,\u201d a request that was granted by the president on January 22, 2021.\n\nHowever, following a request by the presidency, Bala-Usman, in a letter to the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari dated January 25, 2021, explained that the INTELS pilotage contract was not cancelled but had expired.\n\nShe also clarified that the NPA, contrary to claims, still have three contracts with INTELS, which include, the concession agreement for Onne Terminal A and B in Rivers State-commenced in 2005 and ending in 2030; the concession agreement for Calabar Terminal A in Calabar Port, Rivers State and concession for Warri New and Old Terminal, Delta Port, Delta State.\n\nBala-Usman, in the letter, stated: \u201cThe Service Boat Operation Management Agent contract commenced in June 2007 with a review of an extension of 10 years in 2011 to culminate in August 2020. The authority had in 2017 served INTELS with a notice of termination for its refusal to comply with the TSA policy of the federal government.\n\n\u201cFollowing the receipt of the notice, the company complied with the policy and a supplemental agreement was signed to recognise the compliance to TSA and the notice of termination was accordingly withdrawn.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the agreement with INTELS on this service was not terminated but it reached the end of its contractual period in August 2020. In compliance with the Public Procurement Act (PPA), the authority in December 2019 initiated a public tender process in anticipation of the expiration of the contract for the appointment of a contractor to provide the authority with that service.\u201d\n\nShe added that INTELS along with other bidders submitted their bids to qualify for the tender but that INTELS violated one of the criteria advertised for the tender and was disqualified.\n\nWhile this was ongoing, Amaechi wrote another letter to Buhari alleging a shortfall in operating surpluses by the NPA requesting that she be suspended.\n\nThis move, THISDAY learnt, was against the advice of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) who warned against the request in a letter to Amaechi.\n\nThe AuGF, in a letter dated April 16, 2021, had pointed out that NPA\u2019s account for the period, except 2019, which is awaiting NPA\u2019s board approval, had been audited and available.\n\nThe AuGF, Mr. Aghughu Adolphus, in the letter personally signed, said: \u201cI write to respond to your letter reference number FMOT/F&A/ AuGF/2017/4/T dated April 6, 2021, especially with particular reference to paragraph two of the letter and wish to state the position of the AuGF with regards to your request. With particular reference to paragraph 20, \u201cAnnual Estimates and audit,\u201d the Act number 38 of 1999 establishing the NPA and Sec. 85 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), I humbly advise as follows: \u201cThe board shall cause to be kept proper accounts of the authority and proper records, in relation thereto and when certified by the board, the accounts shall be audited by auditors appointed by the authority from the list and in accordance with the guidelines supplied by the AuGF.\n\n\u201cNothing in sub-sec, two of this section shall be construed as authorising the AuGF to audit the accounts of or appoint auditors for government statutory corporations, commissions, authorities, agencies, including all persons and bodies established by an act of the National Assembly, but the Auditor General shall: A. provide such bodies with: 1. A list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors and from which the bodies shall appoint their external auditors, and 2. Guidelines on the level of fees to be paid to external auditors and B. Comment on their accounts and auditors reports thereon.\n\n\u201cIn line with I and 2 above, I wish to state that: The NPA board has duly engaged the external audit firms- Messrs Muhtari Dangama & Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants. The said audit firms audited and published the audited accounts of NPA duly approved by the board for the years ended: December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF added that the audit of 2019 by Messrs Muhtari Dangama & Co and SIAO Chartered Accountants was ongoing and awaiting NPA board\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlso, my office has conducted periodic checks for the years 2016-2018, and issued periodic checks reports along with comments on their annual accounts and auditor\u2019s reports thereon, and reputable professional audit firms are already being engaged by the NPA board in line with the enabling Act \u2013 hence no justification for the Ministry \u201cto advertise and select qualified Audit firms to conduct the exercise. Please be guided by the quoted provisions and accept the assurance of my warm regards.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that Amaechi\u2019s desire to have HLS International Limited, an Israeli handling the $195 million maritime security contract, take over the disputed Secure Anchorage Area (SAA) that was turned down was another bone of contention.\n\nThe federal government had in 2017 approved a $195 million maritime security contract with an Israeli firm, HLS International Limited under the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure also called the Deep Blue Project.\n\nBut in a move that negates the anti-corruption posture of the Buhari administration, Amaechi wrote to the government to ask for another $22.99 million to hire fast intervention vessels to check insecurity in Nigeria\u2019s waters.\n\nIn a memo to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) dated July 22, 2020, Amaechi sought the government\u2019s approval for the renewal of lease of fast intervention security vessels for a period of one year, claiming the $195 million already approved for the same purpose had been put on hold due to COVID-19.\n\nThe memo reads in part, \u201cThe purpose of this memorandum is to seek the consideration of the FEC for the extension of the contract for the lease of 6 no. units of fast intervention security vessels (FISV) on the same terms and conditions as earlier approved by the FEC in 2018 in favour of the following 6 no. service provider: Pearl HPW Limited, Thamson Energy services Limited, Fairway Offshore Limited, Aquashiled Oil & Marine Services Limited, XPO Marine Services Limited and Peace Marine and Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cCouncil is invited to recall that at its EC(2018)40 meeting held on Wednesday, 5 December 2018, it considered and granted approval for the renewal of the contract for the lease of six fast intervention security vessels for a period of one year, at the reviewed daily rate of $10,500 per vessel-making a total sum of $22.995, 000.00 on an annual basis which is equivalent to N7,013,475, 000.00, at the exchange rate of $1.00 to N305.00, inclusive of all taxes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abdulsalami debunks alleged link with terrorists\n\nBy Francis Sardauna in Katsina and Dipo Laleye in Minna\n\nThere was outrage among residents of Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State yesterday as bandits abducted 45 worshippers observing the midnight prayer for Ramadan at Angwan Kwata Mosque in the area.\n\nThe marauding bandits, according to residents, stormed the mosque at 1 am and whisked away the victims to an unknown destination.\n\nBut the police said they had rescued 35 of the victims while 10 were still with the bandits.\n\nThe incidence occurred as a former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, debunked alleged link with terrorists and bandits.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Angwan Kwata yesterday, it was gathered that the bandits, during the raid on the mosque, directed the Imam to end the prayer session before kidnapping the people.\n\nHowever, residents slammed security agencies and the state government, saying the abduction of the congregants raised questions about the capacity of the government and security agents to tackle banditry and other forms of insecurity.\n\nThe residents, in separate interviews with THISDAY, accused the security agencies of culpability in the unending banditry and kidnapping in the area, saying security agencies don\u2019t respond to distress calls.\n\nA community leader in the area, who craved anonymity, said: \u201cThe bandits abducted 45 worshippers and injured many others. Some of the victims are in Jibia General Hospital now receiving treatment.\u201d\n\nHe accused the state government and security agencies of failing to secure the lives and property of the people.\n\nZaharadeen Umar, whose younger sister, Halimatu, was among those kidnapped, told THISDAY that the bandits kidnapped no fewer than 45 worshippers and injured two others who were trying to escape.\n\nUmar said: \u201cThis morning (Monday) at 1 am, we were praying inside the mosque when bandits came and started shouting that \u2018every everybody should stand, whoever runs will be killed.\u2019 I saw a young boy that is not up to my younger brother\u2019s age with AK-47.\n\n\u201cThey kidnapped our brothers, wives, and younger ones, including my 20-year-old younger sister, Halimatu. From our findings, the bandits kidnapped 45 people in the mosque. None of the security personnel came to our rescue during the attack till after one hour before they came.\u201d\n\nHe debunked the police report that they rescued some of the kidnapped victims, saying all the victims are still in captivity.\n\nHe, however, said efforts were being made by some residents in synergy with a vigilante group to rescue the abductees.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe police did not come to this place until 2 am when all the bandits had left with our people. When they came, they entered the mosque and packed the shoes of those kidnapped, and took them to their office. So, they did not even rescue a chicken from this place.\u201d\n\nAnother worshipper, who survived the attack but sustained injuries on his head and left hand, Muhammadu Bello, said the bandits operated for more than two hours.\n\nHe, however, could not ascertain the number of kidnapped victims because he fled the scene.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe bandits met us in the mosque and asked us to follow them but I told them I will not follow them. So, one of them hit me with his gun on my head. One of them also injured me with something on my left hand; so, I started running to town.\u201d\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the abduction of the 45 worshippers in a telephone interview with THISDAY.\n\nBut he said the police, in synergy with other security agencies, had rescued 35 of them.\n\nAccording to him, efforts are being made to rescue the remaining victims.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, there was an attack on a Jibia mosque this morning (Monday) and 45 worshippers were kidnapped, but we have rescued 35 of the kidnapped victims. Efforts are also on to rescue the remaining people.\u201d\n\nAbdulsalami Debunks Alleged Link with Terrorists, Bandits\n\nMeanwhile, a former Head of State, Gen. Abubakar Abdulsalami, has denied any link with any terrorist or bandit group.\n\nAbubakar, in a statement made available yesterday to journalists in Minna, Niger State, by his media aide, Dr. Yakubu Sulaiman, described\n\nthe claim of his having such link as: \u201cfalse unfounded and fake news.\u201d\n\nHis clarification came against the backdrop of a report on the alleged arrest of a helicopter allegedly belonging to him for supplying food and weapons to terrorists and bandits in parts of the country.\n\nAbdulsalami said he did not own such a helicopter.\n\nHe disassociated himself from what he described as such \u201ca heinous crime that is unbecoming of any patriotic citizen,\u201d saying he would have ignored such spurious reports but had to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cThis kind of fake news has the potential of aggravating the already tensed security situation in the country and should not be condoned,\u201d he said.\n\nHe regretted that individuals could be so \u201ccallous to peddle such news and smear the image and character of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerians to ignore such treacherous acts and be careful with the kind of information being dished out and shared on the social media,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to continue to work and pray for enduring peace in Nigeria, stressing that no nation can attain greatness without peace and security of lives and property of its citizens.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Customs agents decry policy failure, extortion\n\nBy Eromosele Abiodun\n\nTraffic has worsened in Apapa and its environs following the disruption of the electronic call-up system (ETO) introduced about two months ago by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) with the support of the Lagos State Government to ensure free flow of vehicular movements.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation showed that security agents, who were said to have frustrated all efforts to restore sanity to the port city, have cashed in on the situation to extort articulated vehicles\u2019 drivers.\n\nEven the efforts of a presidential task team failed with tales of corruption trailing its assignment.\n\nHowever, following the return of sanity to the roads in Apapa last month as a result of the Electronic Call-up System, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had vowed to expose the cabal behind the Apapa gridlock if they did not desist from sabotaging the government\u2019s efforts at ensuring a free flow of traffic.\n\nHe had said: \u201cWhat we are doing now is taking away unscrupulous persons benefiting from the gridlock. Whatever they are earning, whatever they are taking, whatever they are gaining, we are taking it away from them. We know they will fight back, but I am saying it clearly that we are ready for them. We will fight anyone who tries to return us to the past experience in Apapa. We will name and shame them, and bring them to the public court to show our seriousness. We will no longer condone the recklessness and impunity that our people have experienced before now.\u201d\n\nBut barely four weeks after the Electronic Call-up system cleared the gridlock the chaos has returned as truckers who park indiscriminately along the port access roads, impede the free flow of traffic.\n\nExperts and stakeholders told THISDAY that the failure of government policies, entrenched interest and security agencies, who have made an industry out of the crisis will never allow any effort to solve the crisis work.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some NPA security personnel, LASTMA operatives, and policemen have spent over five years in Apapa, as the gridlock has made the Apapa area the most lucrative beat.\n\nOperatives of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) have also aggravated the traffic crisis by blocking the roads to inspect consignments that have been cleared at the port by their colleagues.\n\nThe NCS operatives are permanently stationed at Area B and Mile 2 where they carry out an inspection on the highways.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of Trucks Transit Park (TTP) Limited, vendors of the ETO, Mr. Dayo Adeboye, told THISDAY yesterday that security agents and those profiting from the crisis were the major challenge to the electronic call-up system.\n\nAccording to him, they decided to sabotage the process because the electronic call-up system did not allow them to extort money from the transporters.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, what they have resolved to do is that they will make life difficult during the day and extort money at night when there is nobody to stop them from extorting drivers. We also blame the truck drivers because they offer bribes because they want to beat the system.\n\n\u201cThey cannot continue to accuse the security agencies because there has to be a willing giver for there to be a receiver. The transporters too are not helping matters they should stop offering bribes to beat the system.\u201d\n\nOn the decision to exclude factory-bound trucks and petroleum takers from inception, he said the decision was a strategy to avoid gang-up against the initiative.\n\n\u201cIt was a strategy; when we started, we knew that we could not take the entire traffic in Apapa at once. We also had the extortion cartel in mind. We knew that if we tried to stop all the money these people were collecting, they would make sure nothing ever worked for us. So, we decided to start with port-bound trucks, which are 50 per cent of the traffic. Our plan was to move to oil and gas drivers after that and then factory-bound truckers.\n\n\u201cThe oil and gas are in two divisions, you have the major marketers and the independent marketers. The major marketers are six and they control half of the volume of petroleum tankers. Now, the major marketers if you look at the way they are structured, they came onboard onto ETO very easily because they have truck parks and electronic gating system in their premises,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the independent marketers have tank farms all over the place without facilities and parking space.\n\nHe said, independent marketers were to be integrated after they put in place their facilities and structured plan.\n\nHe said many manufacturers within the Apapa zone had approached him to join the platform so they could have a legal way to enter Apapa.\n\nOn the way forward, he said the NPA should discuss with the Lagos State Government to onboard other trailer drivers.\n\n\u201cWe have cleared the road in Apapa and the tankers have now taken over and they are not structured. So, you find out that many more vessels are coming to the area like Aiteo and NIPCO to come and deliver their cargo and leaving the Tincan Island area and that has pushed oil and gas traffic. Government has to do two things: Decongest Mile 2 to Sunrise along Apapa- Oshodi; dislodge the activities of area boys on that road and dislodge tanker drivers that use the road for parking.\n\n\u201cSecondly, they have to have the tanker drivers start with a structured approach into Apapa as well. NPA cannot clear the road for tanker drivers to start doing unstructured business there.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is the road construction going on has eliminated one-half of the bridge, so, we are only using one-half of the bridge to work now. The ongoing road construction and the activities of the tanker drivers make the road impassable. All the traffic is now diverted to the Apapa side and you have the pressure of traffic on that side. Right now, Apapa is taking more than the traffic it can handle,\u201d he stated.\n\nVice President of the National Association of Licensed Customs Agents (ANALCA), Dr. Kayode Farinto, also told THISDAY that the security agencies would never allow any effort to solve the Apapa gridlock to work and urged the government to adopt the intermodal port system.\n\nHe also called on the federal government to open up the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway that is 80 per cent completed.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is happening is that at night, the road construction company will use heavy blocks to barricade the road and will only open it for any truck who gives N20,000 to the security agencies. From Tincan Island Port to Mile 2 along Apapa Oshodi road they are there extorting truckers. They constitute a nuisance along that corridor and if they are taken out, it will solve the problem to some extent.\n\n\u201cThe government has to relocate all the tank farms in Apapa; if that is not done, there is no miracle that we can have. We will continue to have gridlock in Apapa. The residents of Apapa are crying daily.\u201d\n\nFarinto added that the only solution to the crisis was for the government to embrace the intermodal port system.\n\nHe said the barges that were only recently introduced to reduce the pressure on the road have been balkanised by entrenched interests.\n\n\u201cIf you want to move cargo via barges now, it is expensive and frustrating. If you bring in the best experts in the whole world to come and manage Apapa traffic, that expert will be disgraced in under one week. Look at the beautiful idea brought in by NPA to solve the problem. The electronic call-up would have worked if not for the human factor. There are people who believe it is their right to make money from the chaos. We have officers in Area B who claimed to have been posted directly from the Office of the Inspector-General of Police and there is a specific amount they collect from each truck each day. And they collect the money openly before everybody \u2013 very glaring,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe National President of the National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA), the umbrella body of customs agents in Nigeria, Mr. Lucky Amiwero, blamed the Apapa congestion on the wrong concession that was done by the federal government and the sighting of tank farms around the port.\n\nHe said before the concession, there were holding bays inside the ports for trucks to park, adding that those holding bays have now been converted to private use.\n\n\u201cBefore the concession there were holding bays and truck parks inside the port. In Apapa port, the holding bays are inside the port; at Lilly Pond, the holding bay is under the bridge; at Tincan Island Port, the holding bay is at the front of the port; at Kirikiri jetty, the holding bay is at the front of the jetty but all these were later converted to terminals.\n\n\u201cIn the entire holding bay, the importers and customs agents pay the fees. The ports were concessioned without a law backing them. That was where the problem started. As a member of several government committees and I warned this would happen. By law government warehouses are supposed to be inside all the ports but where are the warehouses? The government hurriedly gave out the place without law. What they did was lease agreement and not concession and by the provisions of the NPA Act, they only had five years for the lease not the 30 years in the concession,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the situation in Apapa is a disorganised system without any law and procedure.\n\nHe stated that the essence of having a port regulator was to guide against the chaos in Apapa, adding that this is not provided for in the concession.\n\nHe advocated a separate access road or exit for factory-bound trucks and relocation of petroleum tank farms from Apapa.\n\nHe said the absence of law backing the concession made it impossible to regulate the terminal operators and shipping companies whom he alleged played a major role in the crisis.\n\nA maritime analyst, Dr. Bolaji Akinola, told THISDAY that the solution to the Apapa conundrum is to take cargo off the road and embrace the intermodal port system.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe trucks that go to Apapa are not only port-bound trucks and I think this is where the electronic call-up system arrangement missed it because the focus of the electronic call-up was on the port-bound trucks, especially container trucks that were going to drop empties, export containers, or pick up imports. There are three distinct categories of trucks that go into Apapa every day.\n\n\u201cYou have the port-bound trucks; you also have the factories\u2019 trucks, which are a sizeable number. They are the trucks that go to the factories located around Apapa-Dangote Sugar, Flower Mills, Honey Well, and BUA, and many more. And we have the petroleum tankers that go to load petroleum products. Don\u2019t forget almost the totalities of the petroleum products consumed in Nigeria today are imported. Based on the recent research, the port-bound trucks constitute only about 60 per cent of the total, and the other 40 per cent is made up of factory trucks and petroleum tankers or tank farm-bound trucks.\n\n\u201cWhen the electronic call-up system was created, it meant to provide call up for port-bound trucks.\u201d\n\nThe electronic call-up, he added, did not factor in the trucks doing business at the factories, which are over 1,000 trucks per day and also the tankers that go to the tank farms and jetties to pick up products.\n\nHe put the number of petroleum tankers going to the port daily at over 2,000.\n\nHe described the security agents who made the crisis a cash cow as opportunists, saying that it is the failure of the system that gave them the opportunity.\n\nHe called for more truck parks to be created, adding that the eight created by the NPA are not enough for even the port trucks.\n\n\u201cThey must create sufficient truck parks that will hold a minimum of 7,000 trucks. That will handle the port, factory, and petroleum trucks coming to Apapa. And all of them must be on the electronic call-up platform and go to the port when it is their turn to do so. However, that will be the short-term approach.\n\n\u201cAnother approach will be to constantly shuffle the security agents and port officials that control traffic in Apapa. When you leave these officials there for too long, they understand the system and how lucrative their posting can be and then deliberately create problems to bring back chaos to make money,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Genetically altered mosquitoes have been released for the first time in the US state of Florida for a project meant to reduce the spread of deadly diseases like dengue, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Reuters, Oxitec, a British-based biotechnology firm, and the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) launched the new project after an odyssey spanning more than a decade to secure regulatory approval.\n\nOxitec and local authorities said they started the project to reduce Aedes aegypti species spreading these diseases.\n\nIt is understood that half a dozen boxes containing the OX5034 mosquito created by the biotech firm were released in the Florida Keys, an archipelago stretching 120 miles (195 km) off the southern tip of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince only female Aedes aegypti bite and spread disease, Oxitec created males that pass on a gene that kills female offspring before maturity. It is expected that the male will continue mating and passing on the altered gene.\n\nSpeaking on how the boxes would work, Meredith Fensom, Oxitec\u2019s head of global public affairs, said: \u201cInside we have a small container, and this is what we put the mosquito eggs in. We also have a small container for food.\n\n\u201cWe leave it open. And then we fill the box, less than half full, with water. We close the lid, and after a week or two, our non-biting male mosquitoes begin to emerge.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the back of similar projects that the firm stated have had over a 90 percent success rate in Brazil, Panama, the Cayman Islands, and Malaysia, Oxitec explained that some 12,000 mosquitoes will be released in the initial stage.\n\nIt said that tens of millions of genetically modified Aedes aegypti will then fan out across the region later in 2021.\n\nOn how it plans to monitor the project, Fensom added that the mosquitoes have been designed to emit a fluorescent glow so that they can be more easily identified and studied when they are captured.\n\nIt was gathered that the environmental protection agency in the US had granted an experimental use permit (EUP) to Oxitec on May 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal residents and groups were said to have expressed worries that not enough is known about the long-term effects of the new tech.\n\nIn reaction, Andrea Leal, FKMCD\u2019s executive director, pointed out that she understands community concerns but added that traditional methods like fumigation from trucks and helicopters have become more ineffective.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing resistance in some of our current control methods, which has made our job at Mosquito Control that much harder,\u201d said Leal at the FKMCD\u2019s headquarters in Marathon, Florida.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to integrate whatever we can into our current control methods just to make sure that we can suppress that population below disease transmission thresholds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "title": "Weeks after drivers strike, Uber raises fares by 13% in Nigeria",
          "text": "Almost a month after Uber and Bolt drivers under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA) umbrella held a strike in Lagos, Uber has raised its prices. At the time of the strike in April, the President of PEPDA, Idris Shonuga, said one of the reasons the drivers were striking was the pricing of the rides.\n\nHe argued that the fare prices had become so low it was difficult for drivers to make ends meet and liked driving for cab-hailing services as a type of systemic poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a complaint that we\u2019re hearing from ride-hailing drivers worldwide. In March 2021, drivers made landmark progress after winning a lawsuit forcing Uber to classify them as workers instead of independent contractors.\n\nThat distinction is essential because classifying drivers as independent workers allows Uber and Bolt to avoid paying insurance, paid leave, and other benefits.\n\nThe victory of Uber drivers in London has led to a global push for a similar reclassification with drivers in South Africa and Nigeria planning class-action lawsuits against Uber and Bolt. For now, Uber drivers will take the small victories as the company has agreed to raise prices.\n\nIn a statement to driver-partners, Uber said, \u201cWe remain committed to providing a reliable earning opportunity for driver-partners, as well as a reliable and affordable service for riders. With this in mind, starting 11th May 2021, we are increasing prices on UberX by about 13%.\u201d\n\nBetween 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Mondays, and 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Tuesdays through Friday, Uber riders will now pay a base fare of N237, minimum fare of N538; N70 per kilometre and N12 per minute. These fares are up from the previous minimum fare of N500, N200 base fare, N50 per kilometre and N11 per minute.\n\nAt other periods, riders will be charged a minimum fare of N575; a base fare of N255, N75 per kilometre and N12.5 per minute.\n\nThere are reports that the drivers are unimpressed with the changes seeing as one of their demands that Uber reduce its commission from 25% and give them a say in deciding the fees.\n\nHowever, the President of PEPDA wasn\u2019t available to speak on the phone at the time of this report.",

          "title": "Maviance raises $3m from MFS Africa to digitize financial services across Central Africa",
          "text": "Maviance, a Cameroon-based company providing digital financial services like agency banking and bulk bill payments, has raised $3 million (\u20ac2.5 million) in equity financing.\n\nThe investment is solely from MFS Africa, the cross-border fintech company connecting mobile money providers like MTN to banks like Ecobank across over 34 countries in Africa.\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s investment gives it an undisclosed minority stake in Maviance.\n\nMaviance\u2019s flagship product is Smobilpay, a platform that integrates payments solutions from banks, mobile money operators and telecoms operators. Smobilpay is connected to GIMAC, the interoperability switch of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) \u2013 the central bank of the Central African region.\n\nBecause it is a business-to-business company, Smobilpay may not be familiar with consumers. But the platform serves over 500,000 unique customers a month, according to the company.\n\nJerry Cheambe, Maviance founder, believes the pandemic has helped increase business owners\u2019 appetite for digitising payments. Cameroon is a country of 26.88 million people. Mobile connections increased by 11% to 26.6 million between January 2020 and January 2021 while internet penetration is at 34%.\n\nWith this seed funding, Maviance will expand Smobilpay\u2019s national footprint in Cameroon to serve more consumers and to move into Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Maviance will be building new products but they won\u2019t go to market within the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cOur journey now is to become a regional company, providing cross-border services within the CEMAC region. We want to be a catalyst for interoperability,\u201d Cheambe says.\n\nHe adds that Maviance chose to go with MFS Africa because they bring money, industry knowledge, a product suite and a pan-African network of fintechs and businesses of various sizes to the table. The deal took over a year, from contact to close.\n\nThe appeal for both companies is to collaborate on building digital financial services in the Central African economic region\u2019s 6 countries: Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nMaviance was founded in Germany in 2008 by Jerry Cheambe and Michael Flach. They launched Maviance Cameroon in 2012, at a time when mobile money looked unlikely in the country.\n\n\u201cI remember saying at one point that mobile money will not work in Cameroon because it was just not happening,\u201d Cheambe says to TechCabal.\n\nTen years later, the landscape has improved enough for Maviance to be raising a large seed round.\n\n95% of Maviance Cameroon\u2019s 20-person staff are based in Cameroon. Cheambe is based in Germany where he oversees Maviance Germany, which operates independently of the Cameroonian venture.\n\nAnother strategic move by MFS Africa\n\nMFS Africa has been on a roll of deals over the last 12 months.\n\nIn June 2020, the South Africa-based company acquired Beyonic, a Tanzania-based payments company, in a cash and shares deal that paid out at least 4x returns for Beyonic\u2019s investors. Last month, MFS Africa led a $2.3 million seed round in Numida, a credit provider for small businesses in Uganda.\n\nWith Maviance in the mix, MFS Africa continues a conscious push to be Africa\u2019s largest hub for digital financial services.\n\nAs with the Beyonic deal, the Maviance team was in the process of raising money when MFS Africa approached.\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, says Maviance has been on MFS Africa\u2019s radar for some time. What convinced him to initiate investment conversations with Cheambe?\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of the asset \u2013 what they have built on the ground \u2013 the ability to work with them and the shared vision of the founder,\u201d Okoudjou says to TechCabal.\n\nMFS Africa was already present in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, working with mobile networks MTN and Airtel. But MFS Africa can rely on Maviance to cover the region and carry out integrations much faster.\n\nThough MFS Africa had scanned the market for other possible partners, the Maviance team had a long-term focus on building solid foundations. It is a minority investment but \u201cobviously both Jerry and I know that there is a possible path forward together,\u201d Okoudjou says.",

          "text": "SpaceX, an American private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, is seeking necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its internet service into Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by Ryan Goodnight, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, in a meeting with Nigerian Communications Commission\u2019s (NCC) Executive Vice-Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, last Friday in Abuja.\n\nFrom L \u2013 R: Consultant to SpaceX, Levin Born; Director, Spectrum Administration, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Oluwatoyin Asaju; Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska; SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight and Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, during the SpaceX\u2019s presentation to the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Goodnight, Nigeria has been identified as a critical market in Africa. Before the face-to-face meeting happened last week, SpaceX had been discussing with the NCC virtually over the past several months.\n\nAbout Starlink\n\nIn 2002, Elon Musk founded SpaceX to revolutionize space technology and reduce space transportation costs. In 2020, the company expanded its efforts to provide satellite internet service: they called the product Starlink. As of March 2021, Starlink had more than 1,100 satellites in space.\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas.\n\nIt is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nCost and Competitors\n\nStarlink is currently in beta, meaning not everyone can sign up. Its beta service comes with a price tag of $99 (~\u20a640,000) per month. There\u2019s also a $499 (~\u20a6200,000) upfront cost to cover the Starlink kit, which includes all of the necessary hardware: a small satellite dish, a router, power supply, and mounting tripod.\n\nCredit: SpaceX\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these rates are just for beta customers. Prices could change when the service becomes more readily available.\n\nAccording to the company, over 10,000 customers currently have access to Starlink, with over 500,000 orders. It plans to expand into many service areas later in 2021.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink appears to be a more expensive option, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nWith the Nigerian government\u2019s plan to bring in 90% of its population online by 2025, it\u2019ll be open to multiple avenues to bring this to reality. There are already a number of internet initiatives such as Facebook\u2019s 2Africa, a $1 billion undersea internet cable for faster internet in Africa and Google and Econet\u2019s partnership.\n\nStarlink\u2019s presence in Nigeria is exciting, but as we\u2019ve seen from the Google Loon project, which was abandoned earlier this year, time will tell if it succeeds.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s foremost fintech company, Global Accelerex (\u201cAccelerex\u201d), is creating exciting job opportunities for young and innovative Nigerians with a strong bias for technology, through its Accelerex Tech Open House. The first edition of the event held recently at Radisson Hotel, Ikeja, with the finest set of creative and brilliant software engineers and tech innovators in attendance.\n\nThe young, vibrant and smart-looking techies took turns to chat with the company\u2019s in-house assessors. This was followed by intense conversations and demos, as each of the participants displayed novel approaches to software design and development.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s objective for organizing the event, Executive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters, stressed that Accelerex\u2019s most valuable asset is its human resource. Therefore, it places the highest premium on attracting the best talents across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a Company, we know that there are Nigerian software engineers that can rival their counterparts around the globe, as recent developments in the fintech space have shown. A critical part of our effort to strengthen the digital economy is the creation of this platform where outstanding individuals can showcase their skills and can join the Technology Team at Accelerex. We believe that the next big names in the technology space will come out of Africa, and we are providing the breeding ground for them,\u201d Mr. Peters stated.\n\nExecutive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters\n\n\n\nThe Head, Human Resources, Mr. Rowland Ogbonda, pointed out that the company is expanding the frontiers and setting a new benchmark in the Nigerian fintech space by giving unrivalled opportunities to highly skilled tech talents with non-traditional education to join its workforce and become part of a team that is solving real-life problems for its target markets.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are many talented innovators and software engineers with disruptive ideas that they are eager to unleash. Therefore, we have scrapped the university degree requirement, and are prioritizing technical depth and capabilities above years of experience for tech candidates, even as we try to champion inclusion in our recruitment process. With our culture of continuous learning, improvement and upskilling, successful attendees would certainly realise their full potential with us\u201d, Mr. Ogbonda added.\n\nFurther buttressing this position, Head, Enterprise Technology Solutions, Mr. Lanre Afodunrinbi, disclosed that the company\u2019s expansion to other parts of Africa made it necessary to beef up the Technology Team to continually deliver superior solutions to its different markets.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the youths and are giving them an opportunity to expand their knowledge and capabilities by selecting the smartest among them to leverage our African expansion and other growth initiatives. This will expose, challenge and motivate them to seek far-reaching solutions to perennial payment problems. Through this, we are also contributing to the economy and reducing the unemployment figures in Nigeria. Initiatives like our open house will go a long way towards curbing brain drain, as young and tech-savvy Nigerians will no longer jump on the next flight in search of greener pastures, when they can have the same opportunities here\u201d, Mr. Afodunrinbi concluded.\n\nAt the end of the session, participants were given a dose of Accelerex\u2019s hospitality, and were treated to upscale dining, gift packs and a free ride to and from the venue. The event gave prospective talents an immersive experience of the Accelerex culture in a warm, relaxed and engaging environment, which made the company an attractive career choice for them.\n\nAccelerex is renowned for its pedigree in innovation, world-class technology, excellent customer service and a commitment to provide fintech solutions that evolve with customers\u2019 needs across Africa. The company has set itself apart as a great place to work with a meaningful set of values that have defined its culture and helped cultivate an environment that embraces diversity and promotes ingenuity.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "Social media giant, Facebook, has announced a new feature that will see users get a pop-up asking whether they have read an article that they intend to share. This feature, which takes effect today, was announced yesterday on Twitter.\n\nAlthough the pop-up will prompt users to read the article, they can still share without reading it. Per The Verge, this feature will be rolled out to 6% of Android users worldwide.\n\nThis new feature borrows a leaf from Twitter which started testing a feature that prompts users to read an article before they share it. Individuals and governments have frequently accused Facebook of aiding the spread of fake news with its platforms, with 1,000 companies going as far as protesting by not advertising on the platform in July 2020.\n\nThis is likely an attempt by Facebook to combat the spread of fake news or conspiracy theories on its platform. However, this is not Facebook\u2019s first attempt to do so. Ahead of the UK\u2019s general elections in 2019, it announced that it would remove fake accounts and reduce the reach of articles that had been debunked by independent third-party fact-checkers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernments, on their part, have made attempts to limit the spread of misinformation. In 2018, Germany enacted its Network Enforcement Act (the NetzDG law), which mandated social media companies to set up procedures to review complaints about content hosted on their platform. Facebook fell foul of the new regulation and was hit with a \u20ac2 million fine in 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, and users can still share an article without reading it. Those who believe that this move is, at best, Facebook\u2019s attempt to appease its critics might not be wrong. And considering the ineffectiveness of the company\u2019s previous attempts to combat fake news and misinformation, there\u2019s every reason to be sceptical.\n\nNew Episode!

Also, we will give you more communication gadgets to enhance communication,\u201d he noted.\n\nObaseki, who commended the efforts of the Vigilante Network, thanked them for their efforts in dislodging kidnappers in the state, as well as supporting the federal security agencies in ensuring the security of lives and property in Edo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cI get daily reports of the success of your activities and successes recorded in recovering arms and ammunition, as well as your efforts in recapturing escapees from the prison jailbreak. I want to commend you for the role you have played in supporting the over-stretched federal security agencies in maintaining law and order in various communities. I thank you for the risks you are taking for us.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of your challenges and decided that the Force grows from the base, organically, not politically; that was why you people were selected, not imposed from your various communities. You have justified your existence, vindicated yourself and the government, knowing that security is local.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are also going to work with you and the federal agencies. Last week, l was in Ogida training school to see the state of the training facility and committed to helping the police refurbish the facility, which we have already started in order to make it available for your training.\n\n\u201cYou all are aware of the height of the security challenges and we quietly worked out our own response and created our own security volunteer network. Today, it has grown, doing what we expected it to do by connecting security between local communities and federal security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe governor reassured that his administration will put in place a legislation to strengthen the security network and help it discharge its responsibilities effectively.\n\n\u201cWe will put the necessary legislation in place, ensuring it doesn\u2019t conflict with the existing arrangements on ground. You are like an operational force to support the existing security structures in the state,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki, while commending them for the rescue of the 13 kidnapped victims, reassured, \u201cAs you move deeper into the forests to dislodge kidnappers from their camps, we will continue to support you in cash and in facilities.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Coordinator of the state\u2019s Vigilante Network, Mr. Yusuf Haruna, noted, \u201cWe have established a Vigilante up to about 75 percent of the 1,416 communities across the 18 local councils of Edo State.

          "text": "BY AUGUSTINE AGBO\n\nThe chairman of the Abuja chapter of the Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), Osilama Emmanuel Osilama, has said that reduction in cement price will help developers across the country deliver affordable houses to Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Abuja on Monday, Osilama said that the recent move by the Senate to compel the federal government to introduce liberal policies to stimulate more investment in the manufacturing of cement is commendable and step in the right direction, especially at this point in time when the Covid-19 pandemic is taking its toll on all factors of the economy, including the housing sector.\n\nThe REDAN FCT chair enjoined government at all levels to make housing a top priority as it remains the best way of employment generation and a basic need of human needs.\n\nThe bill sponsored by Senator Ashiru Oyelola Yisa and five others said such policies should include provision of industrial and larger tax incentives to encourage local investments in cement production in Nigeria.\n\nThe co-sponsors of the motion are: Senators Muhammad Enagi Bima (Niger South); Adelere Adeyemi Oriolowo (Osun West); Samuel Egwu (Ebonyi North); Kabiru Gaya (Kano South) and Michael Nnachi (Ebonyi South).\n\nIn his lead debate, Senator Yisa identified \u2018cement\u2019 as one of the few building materials in which Nigeria enjoys self-sufficiency.\n\nYisa said: \u201cAs at 2018, the installed capacity of cement producers was about 47.8 million metric tonnes (MMT) which is far above the estimated (2018) consumption of about 20.7MMT.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYet, the prices of cement in Nigeria- (N3,800) \u2013 is about 240 per cent higher than the global average\u201d.\n\n\u201cCognizant that cement takes a large share of domestic expenditure and the price of each commodity significantly impacts the government\u2019s ability to provide much-needed infrastructural works required for the growth of our economy.\n\n\u201cFurther cognizant that the recent increase in price of cement (from N2, 600 to N3, 800) slowed down the amount of construction work being embarked upon, thus negatively affecting labour engagement and almost collapsed the procurement plan of the governments in 2020 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cMindful that the Nigerian cement market is oligopolistic in nature with three players (Dangote Cement (60.6 per cent); Lafarge Africa Plc (21.8 per cent) and BUA Group (17.6 per cent), largely dominating the scene therefore making it susceptible to price fixing practices.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that if the status quo persists, the negative consequences of high prices on the economy will outweigh the benefits of producing cement locally.\n\n\u201cWe should be worried that the significant rise in cement prices in the country and the low purchasing power of Nigerians may result in sub-standard building constructions and non-completion of planned infrastructural works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strongly believed that there is an urgent need to encourage more local production of cement to satisfy the demands of Nigeria with a steady growth rate of approximately three per cent per annum; a housing deficit of 30 million units and less engagement of over 10.5 million workforce of the building and construction industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s further strongly believed that unfavourable government policies such as imposition of multiple taxes, erratic power supply, government ban on importation in violation of ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) and subsequent lifting of importation in favour of few producers have negative implications on the growth of our infrastructures.\u201d\n\nIn its resolution, the Senate called on the federal government to provide more industrial incentives and industrial protections, such as concessionary loans and huge tax incentives for new entrants in order to boost production of cements, reduce price and encourage more valuable producers in Nigeria.\n\nRELATED:",

          "text": "The oil spillage in the Niger Delta region has left most parts of the region inhabitable. To this end, stakeholders met recently to deliberate on the way forward. ANAYO ONUKWUGHA writes on the deliberations.\n\nOil spillage and its devastating effects on the Niger Delta region is better imagined than seen. To address this challenge, the federal government created the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in the year 2000 with the sole mandate of developing the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria.\n\nOne of the core mandates of the agency is to train and educate the youths of the oil rich Niger Delta region to curb hostilities and militancy, while developing key infrastructure to promote diversification and productivity.\n\nIn view of this, NDDC recently organised a three-day strategic capacity building workshop/retreat for its directors in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe three-day event, which attracted members of the National Assembly, traditional rulers and chiefs, oil and gas host communities, the international oil companies, youth groups and non-governmental organisations, from across the Niger Delta region, was anchored on the theme: \u201cNDDC \u2013 Collaborating, Planning and Re-Strategising for a Better Niger Delta Region.\u201d\n\nDeclaring the retreat open, interim administrator of NDDC, Mr Effiong Akwa, said with continual consultation and collaboration with stakeholders, the agency was poised to fast track the development of the Niger Delta region.\n\nAkwa said: \u201cThe NDDC is born again and the core of our new personae is continual consultations and collaboration with stakeholders to create commonalities for effective development of the Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nThe NDDC boss harped on the need to review the development template of the region as captured in the Niger Delta Regional Development Master Plan, which he noted, expired in 2020.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe expressed confident that the retreat would bring changes in the processes of the commission and help it to build a strong institution that would provide better service to the people of the Niger Delta region.\n\nAkwa, who stated that changes and periodic reviews of processes were necessary for any developmental agency that wished to make progress, said the retreat was in furtherance of the on-going consultations with stakeholders of the NDDC.\n\nTo the minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, the efforts of the NDDC to restore collaboration among stakeholders would help in fashioning a common roadmap for the development of the region.\n\nAkpabio stated that the retreat was a family meeting called to rub minds and to find ways to help the NDDC to fulfill its vision of offering lasting solution to the socio-economic difficulties of the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe minister, who observed that the theme of the retreat was very apt, said the three-day retreat was meant to challenge NDDC to interrogate and define, as well as prescribe a viable and formidable pathway towards the sustainable development of the Niger Delta region.\n\nAkpabio called attention to the Niger Delta Master Plan, which was activated in 2005, but expired in 2020, saying \u201cThere should be discussions of renewing the plan with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals incorporated in the new plan.\n\n\u201cIt would also be healthy for the commission to consider adopting some or all of the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact for carrying out business.\n\n\u201cSuch institutional support would help budgeting, planning and implementation processes to achieve effective and efficient service delivery,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nFor the chairman, Senate Committee on NDDC, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, it was crucial to get stakeholders to work together to ensure that the Niger Delta moves forward.\n\nNwaoboshi commended the NDDC interim administrator for realising the need for cooperation between the National Assembly and the commission.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the past, we had assisted the NDDC, to get the oil and gas companies to meet their statutory obligations to the commission. We amended the law and today the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) is paying its dues to NDDC. We must always work towards cooperation and discussion for the good of every one.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, chairman of House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on NDDC, Hon Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, stated that the cordial relationship with the NDDC had facilitated some progress in amending the NDDC Act.\n\nTunji-Ojo, who also called for the review of the Niger Delta Master Plan, stated that the NDDC should also think of generating income for the commission.\n\nHe further stated that one of the best things that had happened to the NDDC was the setting up of the forensic audit, which he said would help to clean up the Niger Delta.\n\nThe minister of state for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Omotayo Alasoadura, said the decision by the NDDC to embark on a journey of re-awakening and renewal was a welcome development.\n\nHe said the retreat provided an opportunity for the ministry and the NDDC to create a new trajectory for the commission and the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe said it was heart-warming that the NDDC, as part of its strategic planning, was rubbing minds with traditional rulers, civil society organisations and the leadership of the National Assembly to fashion out ways to deliver its mandate more effectively.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cI am aware that many stakeholders of the NDDC have not been satisfied with its performance over the years. You have been accused of not carrying them along. Given this background, I am happy that you have chosen \u2018Collaborating, Planning and Re-strategising for a Better Niger Delta Region\u2019 as the theme for this retreat.\u201d\n\nPermanent secretary, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Dr. Babayo Ardo, said the overall objective of the retreat should be to reposition the NDDC for effective service delivery as an interventionist agency created to accelerate the development of the Niger Delta region.\n\nArdo noted that the retreat was germane, especially as it came at a time when both the ministry and the NDDC were trying to see how they could come together and reposition the commission.\n\nHe affirmed that the forensic audit of the commission, which had entered another phase of physical inspection, point to the fact that things would not remain the same again in NDDC.\n\nArdo observed that for some of the deficiencies identified in the NDDC to be corrected, there was need for a review of some sections of the Act establishing the commission.\n\nIn his presentation at the retreat, an expert in budget and public finance management, Dr Greg Ezeilo, underlined the important of meeting stakeholders and having an effective handshake with them.\n\nEzeilo, anchored his paper on the topic: \u201cFiscal Transparency, Parliamentary Oversight and Budget Monitoring and Tracking\u201d, said: \u201cThe bulk of the NDDC expenditure lies with them. Fiscal transparency requires documentation and openness to the public. As such, data should be reliable and the publication of the budget plans and outcomes should be done from the outset. There should be open contracting largely to support public disclosure and accountability for tax payers\u2019 moneys.\u201d\n\nHe identified the four pillars of fiscal transparency as clarity of roles and responsibility; open budget process; public availability of information and assurance of integrity, saying that \u201cpromoting transparency involves rigorous engagement of the public in the budget tracking process.\u201d\n\nEzeilo said that government must commit itself to ensuring that fiscal transparency was not in doubt by ensuring that legal frameworks and institutional capacities were strengthened.",

We urge Igbo and Yoruba to be aware.

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has told former President Olusegun Obasanjo to drop the current president of the African Development Bank (ADB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, from the 2023 presidential race.\n\nProfessor Ishaq Akintola, Director of MURIC, stated this in a statement sent to PM News on Tuesday.\n\nAkintola said Obasanjo must withdraw his support for Akinwunmi Adesina because he is a \u201cYoruba Christian\u201d.\n\nAccording to Akintola, reports have revealed that Obasanjo is trying to draft the current president of the African Development Bank (ADB) into the 2023 presidential race.\n\nHe noted that the next Yoruba presidential ticket must go to a Yoruba Muslim in the name of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nAkintola said he based his stand on the fact that three Yoruba Christians have occupied the Aso Rock villa and no single Yoruba Muslim has held the post of president or vice president since independence.\n\nAccording to Akintola, \u201cEx-President Olusegun Obasanjo is reportedly making attempts to draft the current president of the African Development Bank (ADB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, into the 2023 presidential race. We object to this move. Obasanjo wants to waste all the efforts put in place by the Nigerian government to get Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina to that continental position.\n\n\u201cWe remind the former president that as a Yoruba Christian, he has led Nigeria twice. He spent 3 years and 258 days as a military head of state (1976 \u2013 1979) and another 8 years as a civilian president (1999 \u2013 2007). Two other Yoruba Christians have also occupied Aso Rock. Chief Earnest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan was the interim head of state from 26th August 1993 to 17th November 1993. The current vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, is also a Yoruba Christian.\n\n\u201cObasanjo\u2019s attempt to drag Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina who is also a Yoruba Christian into the presidential race negates the principles of fairness, justice and equity. It is an attempt to rob Yoruba Muslims of the presidential slot and it violates a cardinal principle of democracy, namely, inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cIt is an open secret that Yoruba Muslims who form the majority of the population in the South West are being denied their Allah-given fundamental human rights. This has led to complaints and court cases initiated by Muslims across Yorubaland over political and religious persecution. Yoruba Muslims are at the receiving end of the deprivation of civil liberties. It is our contention that another Yoruba Christian presidency will usher in another opportunity for Christian hegemony and the marginalisation, stigmatisation, repression and persecution of Yoruba Muslims.\n\n\u201cLet Obasanjo tell us how many Yoruba Muslims were ministers in his administration. Even in Kwara State which is also a predominantly Muslim territory, Obasanjo picked two Christians as ministers (C. O. Adebayo and Funke Doyin). But he could not extend such \u2018luxury\u2019 to Yoruba Muslims in the South West.\n\n\u201cMURIC rejects this grand design to keep Muslims in Yorubaland in perpetual bondage. There are many Yoruba Muslims who are eminently qualified for the post of president. We also believe that the interest of the Yoruba people will be best served if they will channel their grievances towards ensuring that a Yoruba man emerges president instead of pursuing a separatist agenda that may lead them nowhere.\n\n\u201cWe advise ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo to relax his grip on the Nigerian jugular vein. He should stop pushing Yoruba Muslims to the background. Christians are not the only human beings in Yorubaland. Fair sharing spreads goodwill. Monopoly generates rancour and ill-feeling. There is no true democracy where there is no inclusiveness. The political party does not matter to us. What is important is that the next Yoruba presidential ticket must go to a Yoruba Muslim in the name of fairness, justice and equity.\u201d",

Adoration! Holy Spirit is our Power,\u201d the notice read.\n\nMbaka had on Sunday apologized to the Catholic church and Bishop Callistus Onaga over the vandalization of the Bishop\u2019s court by adoration faithful.\n\n\u201cI do not disobey the church; who am I? How can someone who has been serving the church for nearly 26 years come out and begin to fight the same church? Everything in my life is for the church,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI, Fr Mbaka standing here, I am a child of the holy mother church, and all the faithful are also children of the same mother church.\n\n\u201cI am a baby of the church and an ordained holy Roman Catholic that is apostolic, universal. I stand here to tell you that nothing can destroy the church. I speak as a messenger of God and a mere servant.\n\n\u201cPlease, I have to clarify this, Fr Mbaka has no problem with the Church, and I do not have any problem with my Bishop. Enemies want to achieve that by causing discord, but I will not allow it because there is something in me that will conquer such problems.\u201d\n\nRecall that members of the Adoration ministry had last Wednesday stormed the Bishop\u2019s court at Igbo-Eze street in Enugu, demanding the whereabouts of Father Mbaka, who was feared to have been abducted.",

In the South, security formations and police stations have been attacked and operatives have battled kidnappers, gunmen, bandits, and suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nIn the north, bandits have continued their reign of terror attack in villages and kidnapping people for ransom.\n\nThe security agencies and government has also recorded wins with the release of abducted students in Kaduna, Benue, and Asia while several bandits have been killed and some leaders arrested.\n\nAlthough the details of the security meetings have been kept under wraps, both the President and his vice have called for unity and an end to the violence.\n\nPresident Buhari last week lamented that despite the closure of the borders to control the smuggling of arms and ammunition, \u201cSome people are mercilessly against this country.\u201d\n\nHe charged the leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noting that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nOsinbajo in a wake-up call on the elites in the country urged them to rise up and speak the truth against forces of division in the country.\n\nHe explained that this has become necessary to preserve the unity of the nation as Nigeria cannot afford a war.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford a war in this country \u2026 it is the political elite that will determine what will take place,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\nSee more photos from the meeting below\u2026",

          "text": "At least seven people were killed Tuesday, most of them children, in a shooting at a high school in the central Russian city of Kazan, officials and news agency reports said.\n\nOfficials said at least one gunman had been involved and detained, though there were unconfirmed reports of two attackers including one who had been killed.\n\nA police spokesman said officers were dispatched to School No. 175 in Kazan, the capital of the Russian republic of Tatarstan, after reports of shots being fired.\n\nAmateur footage on social media, apparently filmed from a nearby building, showed people escaping from the school by jumping from second- and third-floor windows, with sounds of gunshots echoing in the schoolyard.\n\nRussia\u2019s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said seven children had been killed and 16 people wounded.\n\nThe mayor of Kazan said eight people had been killed, while Russian news agencies, citing official sources, said 11 people had died.\n\nThere were initial reports of two shooters, with one reportedly barricaded on the fourth floor of the building and killed, but officials later said a lone attacker had been responsible.\n\nThe Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes in Russia, said a local resident born in 2001 had been detained in connection with the attack.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin called for a review of gun control laws after the shooting, while the authorities declared a day of mourning for Wednesday.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Major tragedy\u2019 \u2013\n\nTatarstan regional leader Rustam Minnikhanov arrived at the scene and entered the school after it had been declared secure by law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened that this has happened,\u201d Minnikhanov said in televised remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s a major tragedy for our republic.\u201d\n\nHe said earlier that four boys and three girls were among those killed.\n\n\u201cSixteen more people are in hospital,\u201d Minnikhanov said, including 12 children and four adults.\n\nHe described the detained assailant as a \u201cterrorist\u201d and said the 19-year-old shooter had a licence to carry a firearm.\n\nImages broadcast on state television showed dozens of people outside the school with fire services and police vehicles lining nearby streets.\n\n\u201cI was in class, I first heard an explosion, then gunshots,\u201d news agency TASS quoted a student as saying.\n\nElena, a Kazan resident who said she was outside the school, told the Echo of Moscow radio station that law enforcement was removing people from outside the premises.\n\n\u201cParents are crying, medics are giving out medicine. People are hysterical,\u201d she told the radio station.\n\nPutin expressed his \u201cdeep condolences\u201d to the victims and ordered a review of gun control legislation, the Kremlin said.\n\n\u201cThe president gave an order to urgently work out a new provision concerning the types of weapons that can be in civilian hands, taking into account the weapon\u201d used in the attack, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\n\u2013 Tight school security \u2013\n\nRussia has relatively few school shootings due to normally tight security in education facilities and the difficulty of buying firearms legally, although it is possible to register hunting rifles.\n\nIn November 2019, a 19-year-old student in the far eastern town of Blagoveshchensk opened fire in his college, killing one classmate and injuring three other people before shooting himself dead.\n\nIn October 2018, a teenage gunman killed 20 people at the Kerch technical college in Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nThe 18-year-old attacker, who also set off explosives in one of the school\u2019s buildings, shot himself dead at the site.\n\nHe was shown in camera footage wearing a similar T-shirt to Eric Harris, one of the killers in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in the US, which left 13 people dead.\n\nPutin at the time blamed the attack on \u201cglobalisation\u201d and online communities dedicated to American school shootings which promoted \u201cfake heroes\u201d.\n\nThe Crimea shooter, Vladislav Roslyakov, was able to legally obtain a gun licence after undergoing marksmanship training and being examined by a psychiatrist.\n\nThe shooting led to calls for tighter gun control in Russia.\n\nThe country\u2019s FSB security service says it has prevented dozens of armed attacks on schools in recent years.\n\nIn February last year the FSB said it had detained two teenagers on suspicion of plotting an attack on a school in the city of Saratov with weapons and homemade explosives.\n\nAFP",

There\u2019s no words that I can really put together, other than I\u2019m gutted that we\u2019ve not managed to be successful this year,\u201d Fulham boss Scott Parker said after the match.\n\n\u201cIn between both boxes this year, we\u2019ve had our moments and looked a very, very good side. Where we\u2019ve fallen short at times is the other side of that, and tonight again defensively, the two goals are poor goals.\u201d\n\nThough a draw would have briefly staved off relegation, Fulham desperately needed to win and they started well, with Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Ivan Cavaleiro both registering shots on target that Nick Pope saved comfortably.\n\nFulham were punished in the 35th minute when Matej Vydra chased a ball down the left flank and beat Joachim Andersen before pulling it back for Westwood to steer home as Burnley took the lead.\n\nBurnley were soon two up thanks to Chris Wood, who rifled Josh Brownhill\u2019s return pass into the top right corner a minute before half-time.\n\nThe home side looked more dangerous in the second half as they finally started to get some crosses into the box for Aleksandar Mitrovic, and the Serbian striker went close with two headers before the hour mark.\n\nFulham\u2019s French goalkeeper Alphonse Areola was lucky to stay on the field when he seemed to handle the ball well outside penalty area, but neither the on-field referee nor the VAR deemed the incident worthy of a red card.\n\nDespite plenty of possession, Fulham failed to create many decent scoring chances and return directly to the Championship after a single season in the top flight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time. We failed tonight, we failed this season. It\u2019s hard to find the words,\u201d Mitrovic told Sky Sports.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve it, and I\u2019ve played football long enough to know that football is a really honest game, sometimes you get it in the season, sometime you don\u2019t. In the end you always finish where you deserve to be.\u201d\n\nFulham will join West Bromwich Albion, who were relegated on Sunday after losing to Arsenal, and bottom side Sheffield United in the Championship next season.",
