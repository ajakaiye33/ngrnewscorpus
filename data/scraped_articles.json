          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2014Charges Nigerians to cooperate with Buhari\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nNATIONAL leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has said that there is no President that will intentionally want his citizens exposed to banditry and danger.\n\nThe APC leader and former governor of Lagos State stated this while fielding questions from journalists after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Monday night at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to cooperate and show understanding with the government in the midst of the challenges for the unity of the country.\n\nThe APC national leader, who was accompanied by the party\u2019s pioneer interim National Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, debunked the insinuations in some quarters that he has a frosty relationship with the President.\n\nAsked what the President should do at the moment given the deteriorating security situation in the country, he said there was a need for effective security and effective communication.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHe said, \u201cCooperation, understanding and determination. Effective security, effective information. There is no president who will want his country in chaos. Have you seen one? Point one to me. There is no one that will want his citizens exposed to banditry and danger.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no president or leader that will want his nation fractured by tribalism, religious differences and all that. It calls for serious management and serious evaluation and dialogue once in a while. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the agenda of his visit, he said, \u201cIt is to generally review the perceptions going on outside there and equally focus on the security across the country more. He will have more information than we have, but we are his ears close to the ground and we have to exchange views so that a better Nigeria is grounded. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the best way forward, he replied, \u201cThe best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people. The welfare of our people is extremely important.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times. How we communicate it to the people, what are the areas to help make it easier for people to bear, those are ideas on how to be able to change the leadership of the country.\u201d\n\nFurther asked to comment on the insinuation that he has an unhealthy relationship with the President, the APC helmsman said his relationship with the President remains cordial.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNothing like that, nothing like unhealthy (relationship with the President). Who, is our doctor? Is it social media that is measuring the relationship? I don\u2019t have to disturb him (Buhari) openly on camera, is it? No, we have so many ways to look at issues. We have nothing like that.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that his relationship is \u201cVery close and cordial, frank and honest.\u201d\n\nFielding question on the chances of the APC to return to power after the tenure of President Buhari in 2023, Asiwaju Tinubu said though he didn\u2019t want to predict what would happen then, the chances were bright.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to predict that one (chances of the APC retaining power at the centre after President Buhari) right now, I don\u2019t want to do that subject now. The chances are as bright as a midnight star. We will continue to work for a better Nigeria and that is what you need.\n\n\u201cWe cannot interject politics and assumption into everything, we have a nation to build, we have a baton to pass. You can depend on Buhari that he will not spend one hour beyond his tenure. He will do that, he will comply with the Constitution. So, how it happens? Read the Nigerian Constitution and find out from the INEC website.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Olayinka Ajayi\n\nLAGOS \u2014 The Dean, Borno Elders Forum, Prof. Khalifa Dikwa, has insisted that some people in government were sabotaging the nation\u2019s security agencies.\n\nSpeaking on a monitored program on Channels Television, \u2018Politics Today\u2019 Dikwa said: \u201cWhen it started in Bornu State, people felt it was just Kanuri issue.\n\nThen, the people of Kaduna welcomed me to the media because it was something that has been waiting in the cooler for long. And the humiliation of our military at that time.\n\nREAD ALSO Enugu govt raises alarm over sabotage of NCC\u2019s Digital Industrial Park project\n\n\u201cIf the money meant to purchase weapons were not used, bring them back and get the weapons anywhere else in the world. Don\u2019t go and place the money somewhere for so long and people are dying.\n\nAnd the media is not helping matters, when the money is going to the eastern bloc, they speak up but they keep quiet when the money is in Europe or America as if we are under the purview of the European Union.\n\nKhalifa reiterated the need for technology to win the war against insecurity across that country saying: \u201cMr. President should be able to know what is happening to our satellite bay. Can our satellite give area imagery to our military? Can our Air Force use our own satellite without any intervention? If we do not have one, then we can go to any country to borrow space in satellite.\n\nTechnology is very important. Our military can still do it if the technology is there. Why is it that there are people within the system who are sabotaging the technology? Technology I mean, for our military, we should have Helicopters that can see at night and so on. They are not being given. They are sabotaging our army, police and so on.\n\nBut our security forces have performed in other places where technology worked.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Nigerians are being used today within and outside the country to drag the image of the country down. And every Nigerian must have the data for planning and any opportunity so that nobody would buy different SIM, adopt criminality to throw away the Subscriber Identity Module,(SIM).\n\nTherefore if the communication ministry has not finished, they should be given enough security much more than before to finish the job that when they put Seun or Khalifa, everything about Khalifa is there\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Says consequences of insecurity will affect all nations\n\nAsks US to relocate AFRICOM headqurters to Africa\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has canvassed for the support of the United States in the move by Nigeria and West African sub region to tackle security challenges in order to avoid spillovers.\n\nHe also urged the United States to consider relocating US Africa Command (AFRICOM) from Stuttgart, Germany, to Africa, nearer the Theatre of Operation.\n\nPresident Buhari, in a virtual meeting Tuesday with US Secretary of State, Mr Anthony Bilken, charged the international community to support Nigeria and the sub-region in tackling growing security challenges to avoid spillovers.\n\nSaid he: \u201cThe security challenges in Nigeria remain of great concern to us and impacted more negatively, by existing complex negative pressures in the Sahel, Central and West Africa, as well as the Lake Chad Region.\n\n\u201cCompounded as the situation remains, Nigeria and her security forces remain resolutely committed to containing them and addressing their root causes. The support of important and strategic partners like United States cannot be overstated as the consequences of insecurity will affect all nations hence the imperative for concerted cooperation and collaboration of all nations to overcome these challenges\u201d.\n\nFlowing from this, the President stressed that the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) which partners with countries to counter transnational threats, should be relocated to Africa to strengthen ongoing efforts to check the security situation, with likely effect on other nations.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, and considering the growing security challenges in West and Central Africa, Gulf of Guinea, Lake Chad region and the Sahel, weighing heavily on Africa, it underscores the need for the United States to consider re-locating AFRICOM Headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany to Africa and near the Theatre of Operation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria will enhance collaborations in all forms, with friends and strategic partners, to work together for greater security for all, which remain the most significant condition for overcoming the existential challenges.\n\nPresident Buhari while congratulating Blinken on his appointment by President Joe Biden commended the United States for the decision to repeal the immigration restriction known as the \u201cMuslim ban\u2019\u2019, re-joining the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nHis words: \u201cNigeria attaches great importance to its relations with the United States. Let me in this connection express appreciation to President Joe Biden for his welcome and reaching decision to repeal the Immigration restriction known as the \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 on travel and visas for citizens predominantly from Muslim Nations and African Countries, including Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI also wish to congratulate the United States for re-joining the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The leadership of the United States in these two organizations is crucial for international community. This action is a demonstration of the United States commitment in championing and supporting international organizations with the aim to build a better world for all\u201d.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria remains resolute in her commitment to supporting global efforts as enshrined in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which seeks to limit global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nAccording to the President, the convening of the Climate Change Summit last week by President Biden was a strong indication of the renewed interest of the United States to the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u201cI would like to extend our goodwill message to President Joe Biden and his Administration. May I also thank you for initiating this meeting, which I am confident, given your background and current position, you will use to promote the existing bilateral relations between our two countries,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn his part, the US Secretary of State said he was pleased to make Nigeria part of his \u201cfirst virtual visit to Africa,\u201d noting that Nigeria and the United States of America, share a lot in bilateral issues.\n\nHe added that he would be delighted to build on the foundation laid over 60 years ago between the two countries, disclosing that areas of discussion with Nigeria would include \u201chow to build our economies back after the COVID-19 pandemic, security for vulnerable communities, and climate issues.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A future where we will take into account all of the problems because if we haven\u2019t gone through the problems we are going through now, it will be difficult for us to appreciate the importance of fairness and justice, the importance of giving people a voice and a representation. I am very pleased to hear about what you are doing.\n\n\u201cThere is no question at all that we are facing security challenges, but we are able to overcome them. The role of the leadership is to sit down to think through the problems.\n\n\u201cThis is a big country, so policing is very difficult. There is a need for us to reorganize our security architecture, which is what is going on now.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why we have some of the divisions and conflicts in the parts of the country is because people do not feel included in the management of affairs in their localities.\u201d\n\nCommending the emir for his leadership style, the vice-president said: \u201cI think you have created an opportunity where the options are available for bringing appeals to a centre of fairness and justice for people from across the country, and its one that is to be emulated.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that this is the way Nigeria should be. We should be able to say that no matter where you are from, if you have the talent, if you work hard, you will succeed wherever you are. You will not be constrained by your political, ethnic or religious affiliations.\n\n\u201cEvery great society that has succeeded in the world is multiethnic and they succeeded because they brought in talents from all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president urged traditional rulers to leverage the influence they have over communities to effect positive change for the good of the entire society.\n\nCommending the efforts of the emir in promoting unity and peaceful coexistence, the vice-president noted that: \u201cI have heard a lot about the work that is going on and particularly fascinating for me is the fact that you have somehow managed to bring together a representation of Nigeria into the management of the affairs of your kingdom.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A crucial question here is this: if Nigeria\u2019s president \u2013 the most powerful man in the country \u2013 can\u2019t access proper medical care in the country, how can the average citizen access quality healthcare? Nigerians worry that Buhari\u2019s frequent medical trips abroad are an indication that the country\u2019s healthcare system is far from getting fixed.\n\nTrying to bridge the healthcare gap in Nigeria, Jennie conceived Clafiya\n\nJennie Nwokoye nurtured an idea to build a medical system to cater to the Nigerian population when she was younger. She wasn\u2019t able to put a proper framework around her idea until she began studying for her master\u2019s degree in system engineering and management at Georgetown University.\n\nThough her American accent might suggest otherwise, Jennie lived in Nigeria from when she was 8 and left when she was 14 years old. Growing up in an affluent family meant that her parents tried to shield her from the various issues that plagued Nigeria. But Jennie was an inquisitive teenager who was sensitive enough to know that access to healthcare in the country was and is still impossible for the larger populace.\n\n\u201cImagine having family members or friends who have either died or had close calls because they weren\u2019t able to get access to healthcare,\u201d Jennie tells me during our chat.\n\n\u201cSo that was a profound experience that had stayed with me all this time and has become something I want to solve.\u201d She wanted to build a system outside of a hospital setting because, according to her, \u201cthere are ways to adjust this problem and you don\u2019t necessarily have to be a doctor to do that.\u201d Her hunger to figure out how to address the healthcare problem in Nigeria, is what gave birth to Clafiya.\n\nMeeting Itoro and leveraging partnership\n\nJennie met Itoro at a concert in 2016. They had lengthy conversations about the Nigerian labour market and access to healthcare services in the country. Itoro told me that Clafiya was initially called \u201cHealthcare Mobile\u201d in 2019 and that she was Jennie\u2019s go-to person for information concerning delivery and medical services in Nigeria.\n\nItoro Inoyo has worked in the healthcare sector for several years. She studied at the University of Massachusetts Lowell where she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in biological science. She also obtained a master\u2019s degree in public health from Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health.\n\nAlthough she wasn\u2019t officially a co-founder yet, Itoro\u2019s candid advice to Jennie at the initial stage came from her wealth of experience as she has travelled through sub-rural communities in Nigeria following her work as a gender and PED analyst.\n\nA turning point in their working relationship came in 2020 when Itoro discovered a pitch competition led by Women in Global Health.\n\n\u201cWe applied for that, and people assumed we were co-founders. We had a great working relationship and so we decided to do it.\u201d\n\nClafiya ended up winning the grant.\n\nThe winner of the #BuildBackBetterChallenge for their digital innovation is\u2026@Clafiya1!!!\n\n\n\nWe are so excited to present Clafiya with a prize of $20K to implement and market their innovation. Can't wait to see the impact of your digital health solution#COVID5050 @NovartisFDN pic.twitter.com/gS2wQraYkP \u2014 Women In Global Health (@womeninGH) November 19, 2020\n\nHow Clafiya works\n\nClafiya is a digital platform that connects patients in semi-urban and rural areas to Community Health Workers (CHWs). It provides primary care services to people from the comfort of their homes.\n\n\u201cWith our short USSD code, Nigerians with limited access to primary care services can register, pay, and request for the nearest registered CHW to administer home-based services,\u201d says Jennie.\n\nClafiya leverages AI to apply predictive analytics to geotagged USSD messages for disease surveillance of emerging disease outbreaks in rural and remote regions.\n\nThis also enables government agencies and policy-makers to make data-driven decisions on resource allocation in impacted regions.\n\nThere are two processes to gain access to the platform, the registration process and the appointment scheduling process.\n\nUsing USSD, a potential customer will dial the codes *347*58# and then proceed to answer a few personal questions. Once you have successfully registered on the platform, you\u2019ll receive a text message, and will be led to buy a plan.\n\nClafiya has four different plans: Basic (Pay As You Go), Single Plan, Maternity Care, and Family. After a prospective Clafiya user picks and pays for a plan, they are registered on the platform and enabled to schedule appointments.\n\nThe Basic, otherwise known as pay as you go (PAYG) plan costs \u20a62000 ($4.9). Jennie says the PAYG plan was designed to enable people to pay out of their pockets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as we penetrate these communities, people would subscribe to what I would call the quasi insurance plan, where the prices start at \u20a63000 ($7.3) for a single plan but that covers all of the primary care services that we are providing except the maternity care plan.\u201d\n\nThe maternity package costs \u20a63500 ($8.5). The most expensive medical package is the family plan at \u20a65000 ($12.2).\n\nTesting stage and gaining access\n\nJennie said in our chat that Clafiya was built to meet customers wherever they are.\n\nIn their field analyses and initial testing stage, Itoro revealed that a lot of Nigerians, especially women, were afraid to go to healthcare facilities. This, she said, was due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build a solution that can potentially work for the everyday Nigerian, even if you\u2019re in a higher socioeconomic status.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, a large percentage of the population is still not connected to the internet so as much as the internet business is scaling, a huge number of people are being left behind.\n\nItoro said \u201cClafiya wanted to meet the needs of populations that the majority of systems have forgotten. That\u2019s why we decided to do home-based services to bring those services to people\u2019s doorsteps.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is building apps, right? And the average Nigerian, although they have a phone, may not have a smartphone, if you have a smartphone, you may not have data, if you have data, you may have network issues that limits access to the service. USSD is the closest way to read the minority population.\u201d\n\nThe Clafiya team has done their research, tested their tools, and according to them, one of the things people really seem to like about the USSD service is that it allows them to be in the driver\u2019s seat of their health. They get to call the healthcare workers who come to the services and totally be in control of who attends to them and at what time.\n\nBuilding Clafiya as women\n\nClafiya is currently running in Enugu, a state in the southeastern part of Nigeria and while they are planning to expand into other parts of the country, it took quite an effort to get the proper data needed to access potential customers. Jennie loves to put it that they were \u201cshamelessly\u201d going to government offices and waiting for long hours in order to get the data they needed.\n\nBuilding confidence as a woman is one way to scale through some huddles when dealing with people.\n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t take me seriously just because I\u2019m a woman. They look at me as a small girl. But I think once you\u2019re able to present the facts and you\u2019re serious about it, they tend to take you a little bit more seriously,\u201d Jennie told me.\n\nItoro also said leveraging on existing relationships she has with healthcare workers has made their journey a lot easier.\n\nWhy Clafiya is different\n\nThey are not in Lagos.\n\nIn Nigeria, every major tech startup will likely have its audience base in Lagos. With home-grown startups like Flutterwave and Paystack, Lagos is arguably Africa\u2019s most attractive tech hub for talent, opportunities and investors.\n\nWhile Lagos has the largest market size for any kind of business in Nigeria, other communities are often left out when new initiatives and technologies come to Nigeria.\n\nThe decision to start off in Enugu is so that the broader Nigerian population can have access to the service and not be left out. However, moving forward, Clafiya plans to expand to other communities in Nigeria.\n\nJennie and Itoro say the major objective of building the product is so they can prove that access to quality health is a fundamental right for everyone, no matter your race, gender, or socioeconomic status.",

          "title": "Can NIBSS save BVN from bank scams and be a fair umpire?",
          "text": "NIBSS wants to tighten security around Nigeria\u2019s Bank Verification Number (BVN) system. But there are concerns about fair competition.\n\nOn the 29th of March this year, the Nigeria Interbank Settlement Scheme (NIBSS) published an important document.\n\nThe \u201cApproved Standard Operating Guidelines for BVN Matching System Version 2.0\u201d document is Nigeria\u2019s BVN operations manual. It explains how banks should enrol and verify customers for BVNs, and how institutions can access the BVN system.\n\nBVNs \u2013 unique identification numbers for bank customers \u2013 were launched in 2014 by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bankers\u2019 Committee as a \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d (KYC) infrastructure for the financial sector.\n\nThe ambition was noteworthy: to create a biometric-based standard for verifying client identity and enabling safe, seamless electronic payments. That standard was actually supposed to be the National Identification Number (NIN) but banks floated BVNs following several government delays on the NIN project.\n\nCombating fraud in the system\n\nBVN has become a core pillar of Nigeria\u2019s anti-money laundering and combating of financial terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. It has driven the rise of Nigerian fintech; payments, savings, lending and even cryptocurrency startups have relied on it.\n\nAmong its other powers, NIBSS determines who can and cannot have access to BVNs. Some weeks ago, they showed this power by cutting some fintechs off the BVN system.\n\nReactions swirled that it was a move by deposit money banks (who co-own NIBSS) to protect themselves against competition from fintechs. But according to a highly placed source at a bank, the move was a necessary response to \u201calarming proportions\u201d of fraud that have been traced to December 2020.\n\nThe short version of the fraud story is that when an individual at virtually any commercial bank in Nigeria opened an account, a fraudster who has got access to their BVN and account number would call them on the phone.\n\nIt is not clear how fraudsters get remote access to customer information but the problem only affected customers who opened or reactivated bank accounts from around the middle of December.\n\nThe fraudster would have downloaded the customer\u2019s bank app. To take control of the account, they would ask the customer to hand over a one-time password sent by the bank.\n\nThe scam was being attempted on anyone including some bank staff, the source said. But banks were alarmed because a major target group was serving members of Nigeria\u2019s National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nNYSC mobilises about 250,000 Nigerian graduates each year and is a source of new accounts for banks.\n\nIn that framing, NIBSS\u2019s new 49-page document clarifies and tightens the BVN system for the safety of Nigeria\u2019s financial system.\n\nAccess to the BVN database\n\nBanks and fintechs access the BVN database through Application Programming Interface (API) calls. The CBN approves groups who can access BVN information, while NIBSS manages the security of the APIs.\n\nThere are two tiers of access: tier 1 and tier 2. Both are differentiated by the need for CBN approval and the number of data fields they can access.\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO of VerifyME, explains that NIBSS gives different levels of access to cater to different use cases. Banks have access to more demographic data because their operating license imposes strict KYC and AML requirements.\n\nApart from banks, any organisation that wants to access customers\u2019 information must first get customers\u2019 consent.\n\nThis consent is split into two; one for demographic data and another for details like account number and names in different banks. When an organisation needs any of these details, NIBSS will notify customers, indicating what their consent is being asked for.\n\nFintechs cannot store BVN data on their database for later use. So if there is downtime at NIBSS, there will be no alternative way to do verifications with vendors until the service is back up.\n\nAguele says this is a reasonable requirement for data security in line with Nigeria\u2019s Data Protection Regulation. But he thinks there should be more clarity from NIBSS on how fair the playing field will be under the guidelines.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that NIBSS is a private institution and should not be regulating data access to companies that could potentially be their competitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these fintechs are releasing products that will compete with what NIBSS offers to banks; CBN still needs to update the framework to cater to this reality.\u201d\n\nVerifyMe offers a facial recognition service that is in competition with NIBSS\u2019s product. With NIBSS in control of some of the data useful for that purpose, Aguele believes an antitrust issue arises which should be clarified by the CBN.\n\n\u201cIdeally, NIBSS should not be treated as an agency. There needs to be an independent committee that handles these responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nOn a phone call, a spokesperson for NIBSS said fintechs will find all answers they need for compliance to the BVN system within the new guidelines.\n\nFintech startups like Carbon, Fairmoney and Branch that have licenses that allow them to take user deposits continue to enjoy BVN matching access.\n\nBut the new guidelines might push some fintechs to begin using NIN as a substitute for BVN for their verification purposes. QuickCheck, a digital lending app, now requests NIN from users who want to sign up.\n\nAguele says VerifyMe can be a channel for fintechs without direct access, though the identity technology startup will first have to secure a license from the CBN to provide that service.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBWARI (ABUJA) \u2013 The Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) says the board will introduce the use of USSD code as an option to the SMS process of generating a profile code for registration.\n\nThis, it said, was part of measures it had put in place to address some challenges experienced by candidates of its Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).\n\nThe Registrar of the board, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, disclosed this during a news briefing at the board\u2019s headquarters in Bwari, Abuja, on Monday.\n\nOloyede said the use of the USSD code would commence from Friday, April 30.\n\nHe said the board had received complaints especially by parents of candidates who had tried to register their children and wards but had been unsuccessful.\n\nHe said that service providers had, however, continued to extort candidates by deducting N50 SMS charges at each trial to generate a profile without a positive response.\n\n\u201d Parents are being extorted when sending requests unsuccessfully and at the end, nothing comes or is delayed by network and yet, N50 is being charged and deducted.\n\n\u201d You must note that this charges do not come to JAMB but to the service providers.\n\n\u201d Therefore, we have asked all those concerned to go back and ensure that where a service is not fully rendered and charges were deducted, such monies should be refunded to the candidates.\n\n\u201d JAMB do not have the capacity to enforce this refund or monitor compliance but we are expanding our stakeholders to include Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to do it.\n\n\u201d They will join our task force to check on any act of extortion, while we also invite Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to monitor and check on these service providers.\n\n\u201d Another option we are creating asides sending an SMS to 55019 to generate a profile code will include dialing *55019*1*NIN#.\n\n\u201d This will, however, take effect from Friday, April 30,\u201d he said.\n\nThe registrar, who frowned at candidates\u2019 inability to follow the right procedure for the exercise, also said that the board, alongside its major stakeholders, had agreed to accommodate common errors made during the registration process.\n\nSome of the errors, he noted, were candidates mistakenly sending \u2018NIN\u2019 with no space before typing the actual number.\n\n\u201d Some type without spacing, some include comas and even hyphen.\n\n\u201d We have tried to enlighten the public on how to send and receive a successful profile code but candidates seem to get it wrong. We will work out modalities to accommodate all these common errors.\n\n\u201d That is to say that, whether one puts space or not, hyphen or commas, the message should be able to deliver.\n\n\u201d We have asked the service providers to go back and adjust their systems so that such errors are accommodated and we will also go back to the drawing board and incorporate these errors into our systems.\n\n\u201d This should take five days starting from today. We believe that after Friday, April 30, those who make such common errors should be able to generate a profile code,\u201d he said.\n\nOloyede also said that candidates who had registered for UTME in the previous year could also generate a code with the same telephone number, following the 2021 process of generating a profile code.\n\nHe explained that the only difference between the previous registration process and that of this year was the inclusion of NIN.\n\nThe same code, he stated, might be sent to the candidate but would have undergone an upgrade from the board\u2019s system.\n\nHe also noted that the board was connecting effectively with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) on the registration process and have had not much to worry about.\n\n...",

Gen. Mohammed Yerima on Tuesday, said the act is \u201cnot only unpatriotic but very insensitive and utterly reprehensible,\u201d while threatening to take legal action against anyone seen sharing such images.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cOfficers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army deployed to various theatres of internal security operations are on legitimate duties and are in the harm\u2019s way to defend and protect the country from those who are intent on destroying it.\n\n\u201cIn the course of carrying out this constitutional mandate, troops put their lives on the line to ensure that innocent citizens and institutions of the state are protected from violent criminals. In some cases, these gallant officers and soldiers are meted with the worst form of savagery by the heartless adversaries whose intent is to instill fear on of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian Army and its personnel understand the nature of the noble calling and are ever ready to confront any danger of adversity on the way, what is most unfathomable is the glee with which some people share the gory pictures of officers and soldiers who are either killed-in-action or Wounded-in-action in the media.\n\n\u201cThese unpatriotic acts are often done without any modicum of consideration for the memories of the departed personnel or their family members. In some cases, their loved ones do find out about their unfortunate death in such callous manner before they are even contacted by the military authorities. One can only imagine the trauma and pain such families go through waking up to see the gory pictures of their loved ones splashed on the social media.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army consider this despicable and unpatriotic act totally unacceptable and will henceforth take legal actions to protect troops who die in action from being ridiculed on social media or any platform.\u201d",
