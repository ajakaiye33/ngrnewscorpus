It will also be his 97th ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.\n\nNadal trailed by 0-4 in the opening set, and 0-3 in the second.\n\nShapovalov also broke for 3-1 in the third set but Nadal broke back immediately and held on despite two match points against him in the 12th game to force a tie-break.\n\nNadal\u2019s experience in the high-pressure moments paid off against the 22-year-old who had beaten him in their first meeting in Montreal in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important victory for me. Be able to win matches like today, long matches,\u201d said the 20-time Grand Slam winner.\n\n\u201cTo be able to win this kind of matches against young players give me confidence with my body.\u201d\n\nNadal will next play either Germany\u2019s Alexander Zverev, the sixth seed, or Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori for a place in the semi-finals.\n\nNadal lost to Zverev in the Madrid Masters quarter-finals last week.\n\nFor Shapovalov it was a \u201ctough loss\u201d with only \u201cone or two points\u201d the difference in the clash of left-handers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a tough loss but who\u2019s going to give me crap for losing to Rafa?\u201d said the Canadian who won his only ATP title in Stockholm in 2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time Rafa\u2019s done this. I\u2019m not the first person to lose with match points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s won so many matches on clay. I mean, obviously, he\u2019s a great player. There\u2019s no question about that, a tough one.\n\n\u201cFor sure he does well with the pressure in those moments.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m definitely happy with where my game\u2019s at, relatively speaking, against the greatest player on this surface.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "By Alao Abiodun\n\nNollywood actor, Yomi Fabiyi has claimed that the confession of his embattled colleague, Baba Ijesha, alleged of molesting a minor was obtained under duress.\n\nAmid Fabiyi\u2019s latest protest, Iyabo Ojo, an actress, had filed a lawsuit against the film star alleging defamation.\n\nThe Nation reports the duo had been at loggerheads with contradictory views on the case of Baba Ijesha.\n\nOn Wednesday, the feud between them took a new dimension as Iyabo filed an N100 million lawsuit against him for alleged defamation.\n\nIn a video from the protest, and shared on Fabiyi\u2019s Instagram page on Thursday, the movie star stated that the continued detention of Baba Ijesha beyond 48 hours without recourse to the courts for a \u201cfair hearing is illegal.\u201d\n\nFabiyi also claimed that the confession by the suspect was obtained under duress, with the video where he admitted to committing the assault showing that the embattled actor was \u201ctortured into speaking\u201d.\n\n\u201cCitizens must respect when the police are discharging their lawful duties. Also, the people have rights. But what we observe is that, when our colleague Baba Ijesha was brought here, so many evidences were thrown online,\u201d Fabiyi can be heard saying.\n\n\u201cWe maintained that we would patiently allow the rule of law take its course; allow the police do their job. The CP came out and said it\u2019s a bailable offence. But it\u2019s getting to two weeks now and he\u2019s not been released.\n\n\u201cA minor was used as a bait. Police have not touched on that. There is evidence of torture (on Baba Ijesha). There is evidence of obtaining confession under duress. They even threatened to kill the suspect. The police have not acted on these.\n\n\u201cDPP advice is a legal advice. It\u2019s not a court. This man is still adjudged innocent until proven guilty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe law is the law. Nobody or organisation can rule or extend continued detention of any suspect on bailable offence(s) in police custody beyond 48 hours except a seating judge from a competent court.\n\n\u201cAnd now that the court is on strike. Releasing Baba Ijesha on administrative bail to a reliable surety is the best approach. Even as we speak, the rights of the gentle man is already been trampled upon,\u201d Fabiyi added",

          "text": "By Sanni Onogu, Tony Akowe, Frank Ikpefan, Abuja; Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin, Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt, and Okungbowa Aiwerie, Asaba\n\nA huge division broke in the country yesterday over the call for restructuring and an urgent national dialogue by South\u2019s governors to fashion a way out of the worsening insecurity.\n\nTuesday\u2019s bi-partisan meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, was the first collective meeting of governors from the South since President Muhammadu Buhari took office.\n\nThe meeting also decided that the President should address the nation. It reaffirmed the ban on open cattle grazing and movement of cows from the North to the South \u201con foot\u201d.\n\nSenators and House of Representatives members from the South threw their weight behind the governors\u2019 decision.\n\nProminent Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) did not only support the governors, they also urged them to back their words with action.\n\nThe Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) also expressed it support.\n\nBut prominent North\u2019s Senator Ali Ndume, Labour leader Isa Aremu and a former Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf faulted the governors.\n\nThe lawmakers called on the governors to \u201cswiftly follow up on their resolutions by immediately approaching the leadership of the National Assembly\u201d to actualise their demands.\n\nThe statement by Southern Senators Forum (SSF) Chairman, Opeyemi Bamidele; Secretary-General, Matthew Urhoghide and Publicity Secretary, Chukwuka Utazi, reads: \u201cAt this critical point of our national life when the economy is bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment, and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens.\n\n\u201cAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to the ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\n\u201cMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping, raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\n\u201cWith this uniform resolve by our governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914.\u201d\n\nThey also saluted the governors for seeking restructuring of \u201cour highly lopsided Nigerian nation.\n\nThe lawmakers said restructuring \u201c will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the House of Representatives, members from the region urged the Executive to hearken to the governors by convoking a national dialogue.\n\nIn their statement, members of the House insisted that the ban on open grazing across the country is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements that heightened insecurity.\n\nThe statement was signed by Minority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu; Deputy House Leader, Peter Akpatason; Deputy Chief Whip, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu and Deputy Minority Whip, Adesegun Mujid Adekoya.\n\nOther signatories were Dolapo Badaru, Jimoh Ojugbele, Femi Fakeye, Segun Odebunmi, Mayowa Akinfolarin, Olufemi Bamisile, Oluwole Oke, Victor Nwaokolo, Kingsley Chinda, Essien Ekpeyong Ayi, Fred Agbedi, Francis Charles, Patrick Asadu, Lynda Ikpeazu, Sylvester Ogbaga, Nkem Abonta and Jerry Alagboso.\n\nThe statement partly reads: \u201cThe platform of Southern members in the House of Representatives supports our governors restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring\u2026\n\n\u201cWe also support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, our platform assures of our readiness to deploy our legislative instruments to ensure speedy achievement of the reforms and constitutional amendments that will guarantee a restructuring towards the practice of true federalism in our country and we are rallying our colleagues from other parts of the country in this direction.\u201d\n\nPANDEF noted that the meeting, though long overdue, was a welcome development.\n\nIt added that such gestures could not only foster cooperation, but strengthen democracy\n\nThe group, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Ken Robinson, said, \u201ctheir resolutions re-emphasised our positions, particularly, on restructuring, open grazing, and the alarming state of insecurity.\u201d\n\nIt noted that with rising insecurity, many Nigerians now live in fear and unable to pursue legitimate livelihoods in the country.\n\nOn skewed appointments into federal agencies, PANDEF said that its National leader, Chief Edwin Clark, and 15 other prominent Nigerians, are in court with the Mr. President over the serial breaches of the federal character in appointments by this administration.\n\nIt expressed happiness that the governors discussed many issues agitating many citizens in the South, stressing that the positions by the governors are in tandem with the \u201cthoughts and expectations of the people of Southern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNdume, Aremu, group lash out at Southern governors\n\nTwo prominent Nigerians and a group of stakeholders faulted some of the demands of Southern governors at their Tuesday meeting in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nThe governors among others, demanded urgent national dialogue, a quick end to insecurity, full enforcement of the ban on open cattle grazing restructuring of the country and a review of appointments into government departments/security agencies to reflect diversity.\n\nBut the Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Ali Ndume; a frontline labour leader Issa Aremu, a former Executive Secretary of the national Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf and the Integrity Friends for Truth and Peace Initiative (TIFPI), accused the governors of hypocracy, insensitivity and playing to the gallery.\n\nNdume accused the Southern governors of engaging in a blame game by calling on President Muhammdu Buhari to address security lapses in the country.\n\nNdume told reporters in Abuja that as the Chief Security Officers of their respective states, governors ought to know what to do to stem the growing tide of insecurity.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs far as I am concerned, this blame game will not solve the problem. Governors are the chief security officers of their states, so, why are they talking about the President without talking about themselves?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe lawmaker called on President Buhari to stop the salaries of legislators and civil servants if that is what is required to enable the government to concentrate funds in fighting insecurity.\n\nHe also argued that if the government could borrow to finance infrastructure, there was nothing wrong in using loans to fight insecurity.\n\nNdume also faulted the ban on open cattle grazing, saying the governors deviated from the real issues.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not about open grazing. The problem is security. Most of the security problems confronting Nigeria is not in the bush.\n\n\u201cWe have four different types of security challenges-insurgency, farmer-herder clashes, secession calls, and banditry- in the six geo-political zones. The most important thing is for the security agencies to be provided with the basic equipment to confront these challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Borno South senator also commended the military for stopping Boko Haram insurgents from infiltrating Maiduguri on Tuesday night.\n\nIn Ilorin, Kwara State, Aremu said the clamour by the Southern governors for restructuring amounted to \u201chypocrisy and double standard\u201d.\n\nHe argued that it was ironic that some of the governors who \u201dunacceptably resisted simple autonomy for Houses of Assembly, the judiciary and local governments,\u201d are calling for restructuring\n\nAremu, at a Ramadan lecture by the Kwara State Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in memory of his wife, said while Nigerians can accommodate \u201cmore discussions,\u201d the country should not be turned into \u201ca debating society.\u201d\n\nHe added that what Nigerians needed now \u201cis a performing Republic\u201d that guarantees sustainable peace and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany conferences had interpreted Nigeria\u2019s problems, additional summit is one too many, too wasteful and too diversionary.\n\n\u201cIt is time to walk all the talks. Governors should collaborate across regions, across parties, not divisive regional platforms, initiate marshall plans of economic renaissance to lift 100 million out of poverty as envisaged by President Buhari and get youths off crimes.\u201d\n\nOn the ban \u2018on open grazing,\u2019 the labour leader said governors are not elected \u201cto oppose\u201d but \u201cto propose and implement\u201d alternative measures that would ensure food security.\n\nAremu observed that the insecurity in the country is \u201ca legacy problem of non-inclusive governance and underfunded police force by past military regimes.\u201d\n\nThe TIFPI said the communique issued by the governors was fraught with irregularities and misconceptions of real issues.\n\nExecutive Director of the group, Livingstone Wechie, said in a statement in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, that they were disturbed that at a time the country was on fire, the governors were asking for a national dialogue.\n\nWechie said: \u201cIt is worrisome that at a time when the rooftop of the union is on fire and the foundation is bleeding, the streets are burning with escalating tension and violence, our governors are talking about national dialogue, which historically has never been taken seriously by the government as per implementation.\u201d\n\nHe said the communique showed that the understanding of Southern governors on the subject of restructuring and the current situation began and ended with state police and revenue allocation.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhy can\u2019t they ask, \u2018why do we have separatist and secessionist groups? What are the root causes and how do we engage to resolve to save the implosion? Why can\u2019t they be on the same page with all ethnic structures which they govern on these issues?\u2019\n\n\u201cCan you ban open grazing through a mere communique and how do you enforce that in a beggarly manner without addressing the unending ethnic agitation for land ownership which rights are sequestered in the disputed 1999 constitution and unrighteous Land Use Act?\n\n\u201cThey must realise that this is a crisis for the self-determination of a people, who feel enslaved by a fractured system, held bound by the fault lines of a disputed constitution that took all their lands, resources, and political rights from them.\u201d\n\nThe NHIS boss, Prof Usman Yusuf, said the ban on open grazing was irresponsible and dangerous.\n\nYusuf asked the governors to provide free land for herders to graze their cattle.\n\n\u201cGathering in one hotel and giving a blanket ban on open grazing is irresponsible and will get us nowhere,\u201d he said while featuring on an Africa Independent Television (AIT) programme.\n\nHe added: \u201cSouthern governors need to provide places where these Fulani will graze their cattle because they (governors) own the land.\n\n\u201cWe saw that in Zamfara. The governor is trying to build big ranches in each of the three senatorial zones for these Fulanis to settle and graze their cattle. For governors to ban people from that place is dangerous.\n\n\u201cAsk all the 17 governors that met in that hotel, was there any Fulani leaders consulted? They (governors) are there making laws for people they have not consulted. This is the problem of government \u2013 disconnected, out of touch with the reality of the people.\u201d",

This nation is in great danger, unless we bring a new spirit and approach.\n\n\u201cSo, we challenge the government to look into security matters and restrain those using weapons of various sorts to intimidate people and creating unrest in the system. We expect a stoppage of the carnage taking place in the farmlands in various locations, and we, also, challenge the people at large to recognise that every human life is sacred. As fellow citizens, we need to cherish one another and bring a spirit of respect and mutual appreciation, so as to minimise and eliminate the bad blood that is circulating in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha Province, Most Rev. Valerian Okeke, decried the lopsidedness in the application of justice in Nigeria and called on government to be fair minded in dealing with the people.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government has found it necessary to disarm those struggling for self defence, while leaving armed herdsmen, bandits who are killing many and destroying people\u2019s farmlands. Instead of addressing the cries of the people, they are crushing those who are crying. The government should be fair in dealing with the people. We rely on God who never fails and we call on all men and women of goodwill to continue to pray, since nothing is impossible before God. Do not be afraid, for God will deliver us.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Magnus Eze, Enugu and Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives from the 17 southern states have lauded the Southern Governors Forum for calling for a restructuring of the polity, banning of open grazing and demand for true federalism in the country.\n\nThe southern lawmakers, in a statement by the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu and 22 others, yesterday, promised to deploy all legislative instruments at their disposal, to actualise the resolutions of the governors at their meeting in Asaba, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe members of the House of Representatives from the South, without regard to any other affiliations, firmly support our governors on the immediate ban on open cattle grazing across the Southern Nigeria. We hold that such is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements which has heightened security challenges with escalated killings and bloody attacks on innocent citizens, while crippling social life, economic activities and food production in the region.\n\n\u201cWe therefore support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\n\u201cWe also support our governor\u2019s restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring that will lead to the devolution of power, creation of state police, review of resource control and revenue allocation formula, as well as strict adherence to federal character principle in federal appointments in the shared interests of the federating states.\n\n\u201cWe firmly back the demand for the establishment and activation of other ports in other states of the federation, particularly in the south where such services are in very high demand.\u201d\n\nAlso, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), yesterday, backed the decision of the southern governors banning open grazing in the area.\n\nThey described the move as courageous and strategic, urging them to ensure that they back it up with the necessary legislation; which is the most potent strategy to prevent the monstrous and murderous Fulani herdsmen from overrunning their states.\n\nADF said: \u201cThe law to be passed in the Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. The effectiveness of this move depends on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people including the civil society organisations.\u201d\n\nADF also drew the attention of the southern governors and legislators to the obvious fact that their fate in the current struggle for survival is intricately interwoven with the fate of their fellow compatriots in the Middle Belt and Southern Kaduna.\n\nMASSOB on its part, encouraged the southern governors and other leaders to sustain the southern unity and brace up for the defense of their indigenous people. Leader of the group, Uchenna Madu, noted that their decision had rattled the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and, therefore, urged them not to relent in their ban on open grazing and call for national dialogue.\n\nMASSOB assured the southern governors that Southeast and the people were solidly behind the latest moves of salvaging their people from the marauding Fulani-terrorist herdsmen being brought in from some West African countries to carry out Islamisation agenda.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Molly Kilete, Abuja, Bimbola Oyesola, and Lukman Olabiyi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians to jointly pray against kidnapping, banditry and desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of the country as a united entity.\n\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, quoted Buhari as stating this in his message to Nigerians and Muslims as they mark the Eid Al Fitr following the completion of a month of fasting.\n\n\u201cOn this blessed occasion, I wish that the Eid festival brings with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst all. Unity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one. It is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\n\n\u201cWe should jointly pray against the tragic incidents of kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of our country as a united entity.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithfuls during the Ramadan. \u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities. These are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022IGP orders watertight security nationwide\n\nActing Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has ordered water tight security around the country to forestall security breaches as Muslims mark the Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nA statement by Frank Mba, force public relations officer, in Abuja, said the IGP\u2019s order was contained in a directive to assistant inspectors general of police (AIGs), commissioners of police (CPs) and other strategic commanders as part of efforts by the police leadership towards stabilising security, improving public safety and making the country a safer place for all citizens.\n\n\u201cBaba has ordered a nationwide deployment of police officers and other operational assets of the force for watertight security ahead of the Eid-el-Fitr celebration and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u2022PDP sues for unity, patriotism\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) has felicitated with Nigerians on the occasion of Eid-el-Fitr to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, urged Nigerians to use the opportunity of the celebration to unite in confronting the challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we are faced by all sorts of new surge in terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, vandalism; recklessness and insensitivity in governance as well as the menace of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, this is the time for Nigerians to keep hope alive believing that with trust in God and unity of all, this ugly phase in the life of our nation will surely pass.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi calls for prayers, sober reflection\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State called on Nigerians to take advantage of the occasion to reflect soberly and intensify prayers for the peace, security, unity and progress of the country.\n\nIn his Sallah message, Ugwuanyi, who felicitated with Muslim faithful, stressed that the religious event has great positive impact on the nation\u2019s efforts in surmounting its security, socio-economic and public health challenges.\n\nThe governor, therefore, enjoined Nigerians to continue to trust in God and embrace the cherished virtues of love, charity, peace and sacrifice as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Mohammed.\n\nWhile wishing Muslims the blessings and guidance of Allah, Ugwuanyi advised Nigerians on peaceful celebration and strict adherence to precautionary measures for the containment of the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\u2022Pray for peace, progress \u2013 Fayemi\n\nEkiti Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said the completion of the 30-day Ramadan fast was a rare privilege from the Almighty Allah on the faithful.\n\nThe governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, urged Muslims not to allow the lessons of sacrifice, humility, piety and submission to the will of the Almighty Allah learnt during the Ramadan season to go in vain.\n\n\u2022Ayade harps on peace and oneness\n\nCross River State Governor, Ben Ayade has congratulated Muslim faithful on the successful completion of the Ramadan fast.\n\nHe called on them to remain content and render selfless service to humanity in accordance with the lessons of the Islamic religious obligation.\n\nIn an Eid El-Fitr message to the Muslim Ummah by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, the governor said: \u201cEid al- Fitr offers an excellent opportunity for Muslims to break barriers and reach out to fellow Nigerians, heal wounds and work toward a united, peaceful Nigeria especially at this time our country is facing myriad of economic and security challenges. I enjoin muslim Ummah and indeed all Nigerians to employ a selfless approach in our dealings irrespective of religious, political or tribal affiliations and remain content with what we have.\u201d\n\n\u2022Tinubu tasks Muslims faithful on righteous acts\n\nAlso, All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, tasked Muslims to allow righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan guide their actions.\n\nTinubu, in a statement, yesterday said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding. We must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ramadan, window for national healing \u2013 Nwankwo\n\nAn aspirant in the Anambra governorship election, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chidozie Nwankwo, has called on disparate groups threatening the Nigerian federation to have a re-think by imbibing the spiritual lessons offered by Ramadan season.\n\nIn a message by his Media Adviser, Edward Dibiana, the governorship aspirant felicitated with the country\u2019s Muslim community for faithfully going through the fasting period, in spite of the harsh times.\n\nNwankwo, who is the Chairman/CEO of Wichtech Group, expressed hope that the country would yet again surmount the current challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cGiven the virtuous acts of piety imbibed during the Ramadan, I urge our kith and kin \u2013 currently led astray and operating as either Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers and the likes \u2013 to return to the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cEvery disagreement, be it in the family unit, business environment, community or country, is better resolved through dialogue. We must, therefore, use the opportunity offered by the Ramadan season to promote national healing, by forgiving ourselves. In deed, Allah\u2019s desire for humanity is peaceful and communal living, devoid of undue bickering. As true and faithful followers of God, we must join hands to ensure a restoration of peace in our land.\u201d\n\n\u2022Labour demands sacrifice from leaders\n\nOrganised labour has tasked leaders and citizens to make necessary sacrifice to rid the nation of the current grave insecurity.\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, in his Eid-el-fitr message said: \u201cWe must hear something, see something, say something and do something with every sense of love and patriotism to reclaim our dear motherland from the cataclysmic periphery that the enemies of Nigeria want us fall headlong into.\u201d\n\nWabba noted that the Eid-al-fitr takes place at a time that the country was plagued by fiery storms of insecurity, economic recession and social setbacks with very grievous consequences for workers.\n\nThe NLC president said labour also use the season of Ramadan to remember and salute members of the Armed Forces \u2013 the military, the police, the para-military agencies and the intelligence community \u2013 for their sacrifice, courage and commitment in the fight against terrorism and other forms of violent crimes.\n\n\u2022Pray for peace \u2013 Adegoke\n\nFormer Osun State gubernatorial aspirant , Kunle Rasheed Adegoke has felicitated with Muslims in the state on this year\u2019s Eid al-Fitr celebration which marked the end of the 2021 Ramadan.\n\nAdegoke, popularly known as KRAD, called on Muslims in the state to use the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr celebration to pray for the peace of Nigeria.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to continue with their closeness to Almighty Allah and their prayers for His intervention in the affairs of the country, even after the obligatory fasting period.\n\nHe stated that Ramadan does not just symbolise having a positive attitude during the fasting period, but represents a total change towards becoming good citizens who comply with the law and demonstrate patriotism at all times.\n\n\u2022Soun sues for peace\n\nSoun of Ogbomosoland, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi Ajagungbade III, has called on Muslim faithful across the country to pray for leaders at all levels of government.\n\nWhile felicitating with the Muslim Ummah, the first-class monarch, urged the political class to improve the common lots of the people.\n\nThe traditional ruler urged Nigerians to embrace forgiveness, togetherness and patriotism, adding that the traditional institution will continue to play its leading role in advocating peace and unity.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Private Secretary, Toyin Ajamu, Oba Oyewumi said: \u201cAs we celebrate Eid-el fitr, I call on Muslims across the country to sustain the teachings of the holy Quran and exemplary qualities of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in their pursuits. The festive season calls for sober reflection as individuals and as a people. People at the helm of affairs must prioritise the welfare of the people in their policy trust. As we mark Eid-el fitr, I implore Moslems to pray for the nation.\u201d",

I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile sending his best wishes to all Nigerians and Muslims across the globe as they mark the Eid Al Fitr the president said:\n\n\u201cUnity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges, which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithful during Ramadan.\n\n\u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities.\n\nThese are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also urged Nigerians to continue to observe all COVID-19 prevention measures and celebrate responsibly during the holidays.\n\nLawan felicitated with the Muslim clerics in Nigeria on the completion of this year\u2019s Ramadan fast, saying: \u201cEvery true Muslim feels joy at participating in the Ramadan fast, which is a key obligation in Islam. May Almighty Allah, therefore, reward us for the spiritual voyage and grant our earnest wishes for ourselves, families and dear country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, due to the current security and economic challenges, Nigeria needs the prayers of every patriot now more than ever before to achieve peace, unity, and progress were the dreams of the founding fathers.\n\nHe assured the people that the government, including the National Assembly, will not waiver in its determination to provide security for the people to allow law-abiding citizens the liberty to live in peace and pursue their legitimate businesses anywhere.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us remain strong in our hope that Nigeria will become what we fervently want it to be: a nation that fills its citizens with happiness and pride.\u201d\n\nTinubu also joined Muslims in marking the completion of Ramadan fast.\n\nIn a message issued yesterday by his Media Office, the former Lagos State governor stated that as Muslims, they had fasted and prayed in a special way during this holy month.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan must guide our actions and conduct going forward. Let us put politics aside and continue to pray to Almighty Allah for our country and its entire people.\n\n\u201cLet us remember President Muhammadu Buhari and his government in our prayers that they may be given the requisite strength and wisdom to protect the nation, defeat the challenges that confront us and help establish Nigeria as a more prosperous and just land.\u201d\n\nAtiku in a statement said this year\u2019s Eid-al-Fitr come at a time when Nigeria was going through challenging moments concerning the security of lives and property and when a large number of people were hard hit by the ravaging scourge of poverty.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, we need to remind ourselves of our obligation to ensuring peace and unity within our family and in our neighbourhood at all times.\n\n\u201cToday, across Nigeria, there is a scary and growing tendency to mistrust along ethnic and religious lines. As Muslims, we know from both the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Noble Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that no tribe or race is superior to another, except the one that seeks piety to the Almighty Allah,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the Head of his media office, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, said: \u201cThe current situation in our country requires a sincere change of mindset by all Nigerians. We should use this post-Ramadan period and the lessons we learnt from the fasting period to steer clear of any action which does not bode well for our country. This is a period when we all need to pray to Allah to once again pull the country back from the precipice.\n\n\u201cWith the level of insecurity and economic crisis which have combined to worsen the rate of poverty in Nigeria, all Nigerians must unite and demonstrate patriotism that will help our country overcome the present challenges.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I commend our security agencies at the frontline and pray that Almighty God will protect and give them victory over the insurgents and other non-state actors inflicting violence on our country. May Allah heal our land of any form of affliction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist outstanding allocations are paid\n\n\u2022Say pact must be backed by law\n\nBy Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nStriking judicial and legislative workers have given fresh conditions to suspend their industrial action, insisting that the federal government should prevail on governors to immediately release all outstanding allocations due to the other two arms of government, still in their custody since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe workers restated that they would not negotiate the provisions of the constitution on financial autonomy for the two arms of government and demanded that the governors should immediately set in motion the process of establishing the fund allocation committees in all the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) made the demands in a written response to the proposals made by state governors and the federal government on how to resolve the dispute over financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in each state of the federation.\n\nThe federal government and the governors of the 36 states had earlier agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the workers\u2019 unions at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, sought to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY had reported exclusively that under the new template, the governors would establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nBut in their response to the government\u2019s proposal, which was submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Tuesday, the striking workers also demanded that a law be immediately enacted to back the implementation of any agreement reached with the governors.\n\nA top official of one of the unions told THISDAY that the workers were also demanding that \u201cin consonance with the Executive Order 10, that whatever monies that are in the possession of the governors and are yet to be disbursed should be disbursed immediately.\u201d\n\nHe added that the unions are also insisting that there should be uniformity of the law setting up the fund allocation committees to ensure a common template for revenue sharing in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nThe official said: \u201cWe demand that there should be a law in all the states to back up the revenue-sharing template. In addition, in consonance with Executive Order 10, the governors should also ensure that whatever that is their hands that they have not disbursed are released. They should disburse it immediately. They should put in motion the process of setting up the State Fund Allocation Committee as proposed.\n\n\u201cThere should be uniformity in the law setting up the revenue sharing template in all the states. We don\u2019t want a variant of the law. It doesn\u2019t matter what a state generates. We know that every state will not have the same amount because some of the states earn derivation fund. What is important is that the sharing formula is the same.\u201d\n\nOn having the governors as signatories to any agreement reached to resolve the financial autonomy dispute, the source said JUSUN and PASAN insisted that each state governor should sign the agreement by himself and not through a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, in continuation of negotiations to end the dispute, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, on Tuesday held a meeting with the representative of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, on how to respond to issues raised by the striking workers.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting followed the receipt of a written response by the workers to an earlier offer made by the governors in a bid to resolve the lingering dispute.\n\nIt was learnt that Ngige, Lalong and others were not able to trash out the issues and had agreed to meet again yesterday (Wednesday) in order to allow for wider consultations.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that a meeting with the leadership of the workers may be convened tomorrow to iron out the remaining issues with a view to secure the suspension of the strike.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN have been on strike for over one month.\n\nThe unions are seeking the full implementation of the constitutionally guaranteed financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Again, prices near $70\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has picked 16 consortia for its new crude-for-fuel swap contracts for one year starting in August.\n\nA report yesterday by Reuters listed the consortia to include major Swiss trading firms, Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as large Nigerian traders, Sahara Energy, Oando and MRS Oil.\n\nOther companies which qualified for the contracts, according to a list sighted by THISDAY include: AY Mai Kifi, based in Kano; Litasco, a South African firm; Bono Energy, Lagos; Duke Oil, an NNPC subsidiary; Eyrie Energy, based in Abuja; Asian Energy Services; Prudent; BP and Mocoh.\n\nThe contracts, known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP), are coveted since they are used to supply nearly all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol needs as well as cover some of its diesel and jet fuel consumption.\n\nThe companies were invited on Friday to submit commercial bids, which were due on Tuesday, according to the report.\n\nThose involved in the process said the list of winners was unlikely to change substantially, with the new DSDPs expected to replace those from 2019, which were extended until mid-2021.\n\nTraditionally, if a foreign oil company wins, then it is typically paired with at least one local firm.\n\nNNPC uses a DSDP mechanism to secure Nigeria\u2019s fuel requirements in exchange for crude, a practice that has gone on for years as all the country\u2019s refineries have remained comatose.\n\nIn an interview last year, NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said the DSDP had resulted in savings of more than $1 billion a year since its introduction.\n\nNigeria relies almost entirely on imports to meet oil product demand because of significant and prolonged operational problems at its 445,000 bpd of refining capacity.\n\nThe country consumes over 350,000 bpd of petrol with the majority sourced from Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices rose yesterday on signs of a speedy economic recovery and upbeat forecasts for energy demand supported by vaccinations against COVID-19 although waves of infections in India and Brazil curbed gains.\n\nBrent crude climbed 83 cents, or 1.2 per cent to $69.38 a barrel, earlier in the day, with West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude rising 86 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $66.14.\n\nAs at yesterday evening, prices of Brent had hit $69.86, a few cents shy of the much expected $70 while WTI was at $66.56.\n\nIt coincided with a monthly report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which noted that demand for oil will exceed the output of top producers.\n\n\u201cThe anticipated supply growth through the rest of this year comes nowhere close to matching our forecast for significantly stronger demand beyond the second quarter,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nOil prices were also supported by the outlook from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which on Tuesday stuck to a forecast for a strong recovery in world oil demand in 2021, with growth in China and the United States, outweighing the impact of the coronavirus crisis in India.\n\nPrices were further impacted by data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group showing that U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to May 7.\n\nThe fall came before the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a cyberattack last Friday, forcing the shutdown of a pipeline that transports more than 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that.\n\n\u201cThe other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned,\u2019\u2019 Bawa said.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Federal High Court in Abuja had fixed May 17 for the EFCC to report on how it complied with the court order in the trial of Alison-Madueke.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had accused the former minister of fleeing the country to escape justice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "title": "Seerbit\u2019s Omoniyi Kolade wants financial inclusion for all Africans",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I learned two things about the man. He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "Telecom giant, Airtel, has released its financial report for Q1 2021. It increased its data and mobile money subscribers significantly between January and March 2021. The company also saw a massive rise in profit from Q1 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021.\n\nComparing revenue from Q1 2020 with the first quarter of this year, Airtel saw a significant increase in revenue. The revenue for Q1 2021 stood at $1.03 billion, dwarfing Q1 2020\u2019s revenue of $899 million by 21.7%. However, a constant currency change puts the revenue growth at 15.4%.\n\nAs with previous reports from Airtel and other telecom giants like MTN and Safaricom, voice is still king. However, data and mobile money recorded increases of 31.7% and 38.7% from Q1 2020, respectively.\n\nThe report says that the COVID-19 pandemic has \u201cshown that the telecoms industry is a key and essential service for these economies, allowing customers to work remotely, reduce their travel, keep connected and have access to affordable entertainment and financial services.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the period in question, revenue from voice stood at $547 million, 12.8% (constant currency) more than last year\u2019s. Although considering currency fluctuations, the revenue would be 7.2% higher (reported currency).\n\nIn terms of subscribers, Airtel nailed a 6.9% growth from Q1 2020. Its total subscriber base grew from $110.6 million in Q1 2020 to $118.2 million in Q1 2021.\n\nData revenue in Q1 2021 increased by 31.7% from Q1 of 2020. The $315 million revenue from Q1 2021 surpassed Q1 2020 \u2014 $253 \u2014 by $162 million.\n\nThe rise in data revenue can be inferred from the increase in data subscribers. The network increased its data subscribers by 14.5%, putting the number of data subscribers at 40.6 million, 5.2 million more than 3.4 million in Q1 2020.\n\nAirtel\u2019s Mobile Money accounted for the least revenue, with $110 million in revenue. However, it surpassed the $83 million of Q1 2020 by 38.7%. Its mobile money customer base went from 18.3 million in Q1 2020 to 21.7 million in Q1 2021, an 18.5% increase.\n\nThough mobile money accounts for the telecom giant\u2019s least revenue, it wants to drive financial inclusion with the platform. It believes that the unbanked customers across the 14 countries where it is present can benefit significantly from its mobile money services.\n\nAirtel has increased its mobile money agents by 30.7%. However, the report did not state the number of mobile money agents there was prior and the precise number it\u2019s at now. Airtel\u2019s Mobile Money services currently serve 21.7 million customers, 18.3% of Airtel\u2019s customer base.\n\nDespite a mere 6.9% growth in total subscribers, Airtel recorded significantly higher profit from Q1 2020. Q1 2021\u2019s profit before tax was $215 million, a 121% rise from $97 million in Q1 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter tax, Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 profits stood at $154 million and $77 million, respectively, a 100% difference between both periods. Airtel attributes the staggering rise in profit to the effective execution of its strategy.\n\nThe company generated total revenue of $422 million in Nigeria for Q1 2021, a 23.9% rise from $377 million in Q1 2020, making it the telecom giant\u2019s biggest market for the period in question.\n\nAirtel recorded more revenue in Nigeria than in the East African countries \u2014 Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia \u2014 where it is present.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s growth surpassed all six countries combined, East Africa still has significant revenue growth of 23.9%. It exceeded its $310 million revenue in Q1 2020 by $48 million, bringing Q1 2021\u2019s revenue to $358 million.\n\nFrancophone Africa also boasts of big business between January and March 2021. Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and the four other Francophone countries where the network is present saw a revenue increase of 15.9%.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria outperformed all seven countries by $162 million (38.4%). Francophone Africa recorded a revenue of $260 million in Q1 of 2021, a significant leap from $215 million in Q1 2020.\n\nSurprisingly, Airtel still plays second or third fiddle to its competitors (MTN and Glo) in major markets. Perhaps this is why Airtel Africa\u2019s parent company, Bharti Airtel, has appointed Segun Ogunsanya \u2014 Airtel Nigeria CEO \u2014 as Airtel Africa CEO.\n\nSucceeding Raghunath Mandava as the new CEO, Ogunsanya\u2019s management of Airtel Nigeria, a large market, could help Airtel Africa lead telecommunication in Africa.\n\nAirtel\u2019s boisterous performance in Q1 2021 would appear that its strategy is working. With such margins between the same period in 2020, keeping to the strategy could yield amazing rewards for the telecom company.\n\nFeatured image credit: Photo Credit: jbdodane Flickr via Compfight cc\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

Perhaps this is why Airtel Africa\u2019s parent company, Bharti Airtel, has appointed Segun Ogunsanya \u2014 Airtel Nigeria CEO \u2014 as Airtel Africa CEO.\n\nSucceeding Raghunath Mandava as the new CEO, Ogunsanya\u2019s management of Airtel Nigeria, a large market, could help Airtel Africa lead telecommunication in Africa.\n\nAirtel\u2019s boisterous performance in Q1 2021 would appear that its strategy is working. With such margins between the same period in 2020, keeping to the strategy could yield amazing rewards for the telecom company.\n\nFeatured image credit: Photo Credit: jbdodane Flickr via Compfight cc\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "Lycamobile has been granted a National Telecommunication Operator licence by the Uganda Communications Commission, making it the country\u2019s third national operator. This licence was granted on March 24, 2021.\n\nLycamobile\u2019s application was approved following a change to the country\u2019s licensing framework in 2020, which allowed the country\u2019s telecom operators to apply for any licence they choose.\n\nAs part of the requirements for the new licence, Lycamobile is expected to increase its network coverage to 90% of the country within five years of receiving the licence and list 20% of its shares on the Uganda Securities Exchange.\n\nLycamobile is a British mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) with a presence in 23 countries. In Uganda, it operates under its parent company, Tangerine Limited, which has been present in Uganda since 2008. By acquiring this licence, it joins Uganda Telecom Limited (UTL), MTN, and Airtel as the country\u2019s national operators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt an event held to announce Lycamobile\u2019s licence, Irene Kaggwa Sewankambo, the Acting Executive Director of the UCC, said the entrance of a new player to any space is supposed to improve competitiveness in the sector and ultimately improve services for the consumers.\n\nThis does not appear to be the case for the Ugandan telecommunications sector or even the consumers because of the government\u2019s attempts at Internet censorship.\n\nUnder the guise of adding a new revenue source to the government, the Museveni-led government introduced a social media tax in 2018 that saw Ugandans paying USh200 ($0.05) daily to use social media and other over-the-top services.\n\nConsequently, several Ugandans used VPN services to access the Internet and avoid paying the tax. Tax revenues dropped as a result, with the UCC posting figures that showed a drop in tax revenues from USh5.6 billion (~$1.5 million) in July 2018 to USh3.97 billion (~$1.1 million) in September 2018.\n\nOf the projected USh275 billion ($77.8 million) revenue, the country only realised about USh 47 billion ($13.5 million). Internet subscriptions were not spared, declining by 15% and 0.39% in August and September 2019, respectively.\n\nWith the failure of the OTT tax, the government plans to introduce a 12% tax on Internet bundles from July 1, pending approval from members of parliament. Data used to provide educational and medical services are exempt from this tax. Unlike the social media tax, this tax would be harder to evade as it has to be paid when purchasing Internet bundles.\n\nIn 2013, President Yoweri Museveni announced Uganda Vision 2040, a development plan that was supposed to see Uganda move from a rural economy to a competitive and market-driven economy by 2040. This plan now looks in danger of failing with an increasing possibility that more Ugandans would leave the Internet because of the government\u2019s proposed tax on Internet subscribers.\n\nUganda has witnessed many Internet lockdowns in the past, with the most recent coming during the 2021 elections. Social media and messaging apps were shut down ahead of the elections, which returned Museveni for his sixth term. In the build-up to Uganda\u2019s 2016 presidential elections, social media was also shut down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media and Internet shutdowns, while usually politically motivated, frequently have economic implications. Sub-Saharan Africa lost $237 million to Internet censorship in 2020. For one of the poorest regions globally, that amount of money could have gone a long way to aid economic development.\n\nFor Lycamobile and other telecom operators in the country, this should be a cause for concern. A reduction in the number of Internet users in the country could mean less revenue for the companies and subsequently less tax revenue for the government.\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Naira4dollar policy, introduced by the Central Bank of Nigerian on March 8, is expected to end come May 8.\n\nBut within such a short space of time, the policy\u2019s impact on Nigerians has made them to clamour for its extension.\n\nFor instance, Mr Ugochukwu Okoro, a FirstBank customer, said he was not aware of the Naira4dollar promo until he received money from his brother in the United States of America.\n\nOkoro said he was surprised when his account was credited and upon enquiry he was told it was the fallout of the Naira4dollar scheme introduced by the apex bank to boost Diaspora remittance.\n\nWhile he applauded FirstBank\u2019s seamless service delivery and reward to its customers, Okoro urged the CBN to extend the policy to enhance awareness for the needed impact to be felt.\n\nSimilarly, Mrs Blessing Adebayo, another FirstBank customer, who lauded the initiative, said she was amazed when her brother sent money to her and she was rewarded.\n\nAdebayo said she received N25, 000 in cash on 5,000 dollars sent by her brother in the Diaspora to meet family needs.\n\nJust as the policy is gradually coming to an end, many Nigerians who have benefited from it and those yet to, believe the apex bank should review its impact and consider an extension for more Nigerians in the Diaspora to take advantage of the initiative.\n\nFinancial experts have weighed in on the call for the apex bank to extend the timeline of the scheme.\n\nChief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., Mr Ambrose Omordion, was emphatic that the CBN should review the policy and extend its timeline for better result or effect.\n\nHis reasons are not far-fetched. He said the introduction of Naira4dollar by CBN in seven weeks had not done much to support exchange rate stability as the rates continued to fluctuate within this period.\n\nHe noted that the devaluation of naira over time had continued to weaken the nation\u2019s currency and encouraged imported inflation, which invariably led to today\u2019s galloping inflation rate of 18.17 per cent.\n\nHe is, therefore, of the view that the scheme should be extended to encourage Nigerians in the Diaspora to remit more into the country and also improve foreign exchange inflows.\n\nIndeed, when the CBN introduced the Naira4dollar policy to boost Diaspora remittance into the nation, the overriding objective was that it would stabilise the exchange rate.\n\nThe expectation of the CBN governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, was that the policy would enlarge the scope of foreign exchange inflows into the country to support the external reserves.\n\nEven before the introduction of the scheme, the apex bank had in December 2020 introduced a policy that allowed beneficiaries of remittances from abroad to receive cash payments in the foreign currency of their choice.\n\nIn a circular announcing the policy, the CBN said: \u201cInternational Money Transfer Operators, IMTOs must ensure that all funds in favour of beneficiaries/recipients in Nigeria be deposited into the Agent Banks\u2019 correspondent account.\n\n\u201cAgent Banks (Deposit Money Banks) in Nigeria will be responsible for the payment to beneficiaries/recipients either in foreign currency cash (USD) or into the beneficiaries/recipients\u2019 domiciliary account in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe mode (of payment either in cash or transfer) is at the sole discretion of the beneficiaries/recipients,\u201d said the circular.\n\nThe expectation of the apex bank is that the policy will deepen the foreign exchange market, provide more liquidity and create more transparency in the administration of Diaspora remittances into Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, to complement this policy, especially in terms of encouraging Nigerians in the Diaspora to patronise official channels for remittance transfers, the Naira4dollar scheme was introduced.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the Naira4dollar policy gives N5 rebate for every 1dollar sent by Nigerians in the Diaspora to the country, which is paid directly to the account of the beneficiaries, following the receipt of the remittance inflows.\n\nThe CBN had promised that the new policy would provide Nigerians in the Diaspora with cheaper and more convenient ways of making remittances to Nigeria.\n\nDefending the dollar policy, Emefiele said the move was also to increase the transparency of remittance inflows and reduce rent-seeking activities.\n\nHe was optimistic that the new policy would encourage banks and financial institutions to develop products and investment vehicles, geared toward attracting investments from Nigerians in the Diaspora.\n\nReiterating the provision in a new circular on remittances, the CBN boss said the bank introduced the rebate of N5 for every 1dollar of fund remitted to Nigeria, through International Money Transfer Operators (IMTOs) licensed by the CBN in order to incentivise the process of remittance.\n\nEmefiele explained that the new measure would help to make the process of sending remittance through commercial bank channels cheaper and more convenient for Nigerians in the Diaspora.\n\nThe policy was sweet music to some commercial banks; they soon latched onto it, ensuring seamless flow of Diaspora remittances.\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Ltd., Access Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa, Fidelity Bank Plc and Zenith Bank Plc, among others partnered IMTOs to ensure the success of the scheme.\n\nIn no time, FirstBank partnered many IMTOs such as Western Union, RIA, WorldRemit, MoneyGram, Transfast and AWS Malta to ensure increased participation.\n\nThe bank aligned it processes with over 12 new IMTOs to support the apex bank\u2019s initiative aimed at boosting foreign exchange and financial inclusion.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, FirstBank\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Dr Adesola Adeduntan said \u201cat FirstBank, we are pleased to participate in the CBN\u2019s Naira4Dollar scheme as it will contribute to deepening financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s an activity we are pleased to lead, whilst promoting access to funds across the nooks and crannies of the country in almost 127 years of our existence.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be a gateway to promoting dollar remittances into the country and we encourage our customers, their loved ones and friends to use our international money transfer services.\n\n\u201cIt will enable them to enjoy the rewards of this promo, sustaining the increase in inflows of Diaspora remittances into Nigeria, consequently help in poverty reduction, income redistribution and enhancement of economic growth,\u201d Adeduntan said.\n\nHe noted that the bank pioneered international funds transfer and remittances over 25 years ago and had been in the forefront of promoting cross border payments in the country, having started the journey with Western Union Money Transfer.\n\nAdeduntan said the bank\u2019s wealth of experience and operation in over 750 locations nationwide gave it an edge in the market.\n\nHe said the bank recently launched the First Global Transfer product to promote international transfer of funds across its subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe bank\u2019s subsidiaries in Africa include FBNBank DRC, FBNBank Ghana, FBNBank Gambia, FBNBank Guinea, FBNBank Sierra-Leone, FBNBank Senegal.\n\nAdeduntan said all the bank\u2019s sell money transfer products, noting that N100 billion worth of transaction was carried out in 2020 involving over one million customers.\n\nAlso, Access Bank Plc in March unveiled a reward scheme for its customers to promote Diaspora remittances into country.\n\nAccess Bank\u2019s Executive Director Retail Banking, Mr Victor Etuokwu, said the bank would be rewarding customers with five naira on every one dollar received from their loved ones or associates abroad through foreign remittances.\n\nHe said the five naira for every dollar cashback would be paid to Access Bank customers irrespective of their preference to receive funds as US dollars cash pick-up over the counter or direct transfer into their domiciliary accounts.\n\nAccording to him, the reward scheme is in line with the CBN\u2019s \u201cNaira4Dollar scheme\u201d aimed at encouraging inflow of Diaspora remittances into the country.\n\n\u201cRemittance services are a key aspect of our economy and it is still vibrant and viable today because people still take care of family members, loved ones, friends and invest at home even as they live abroad,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom all indications, the Naira4Dollar scheme has had a fair outing so far, hence when it comes up for review, the apex bank is expected to extend its timeline for the benefit of all the stakeholders, and in the overall interest of the economy.\n\n...",

they soon latched onto it, ensuring seamless flow of Diaspora remittances.\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Ltd., Access Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa, Fidelity Bank Plc and Zenith Bank Plc, among others partnered IMTOs to ensure the success of the scheme.\n\nIn no time, FirstBank partnered many IMTOs such as Western Union, RIA, WorldRemit, MoneyGram, Transfast and AWS Malta to ensure increased participation.\n\nThe bank aligned it processes with over 12 new IMTOs to support the apex bank\u2019s initiative aimed at boosting foreign exchange and financial inclusion.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, FirstBank\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Dr Adesola Adeduntan said \u201cat FirstBank, we are pleased to participate in the CBN\u2019s Naira4Dollar scheme as it will contribute to deepening financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s an activity we are pleased to lead, whilst promoting access to funds across the nooks and crannies of the country in almost 127 years of our existence.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be a gateway to promoting dollar remittances into the country and we encourage our customers, their loved ones and friends to use our international money transfer services.\n\n\u201cIt will enable them to enjoy the rewards of this promo, sustaining the increase in inflows of Diaspora remittances into Nigeria, consequently help in poverty reduction, income redistribution and enhancement of economic growth,\u201d Adeduntan said.\n\nHe noted that the bank pioneered international funds transfer and remittances over 25 years ago and had been in the forefront of promoting cross border payments in the country, having started the journey with Western Union Money Transfer.\n\nAdeduntan said the bank\u2019s wealth of experience and operation in over 750 locations nationwide gave it an edge in the market.\n\nHe said the bank recently launched the First Global Transfer product to promote international transfer of funds across its subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe bank\u2019s subsidiaries in Africa include FBNBank DRC, FBNBank Ghana, FBNBank Gambia, FBNBank Guinea, FBNBank Sierra-Leone, FBNBank Senegal.\n\nAdeduntan said all the bank\u2019s sell money transfer products, noting that N100 billion worth of transaction was carried out in 2020 involving over one million customers.\n\nAlso, Access Bank Plc in March unveiled a reward scheme for its customers to promote Diaspora remittances into country.\n\nAccess Bank\u2019s Executive Director Retail Banking, Mr Victor Etuokwu, said the bank would be rewarding customers with five naira on every one dollar received from their loved ones or associates abroad through foreign remittances.\n\nHe said the five naira for every dollar cashback would be paid to Access Bank customers irrespective of their preference to receive funds as US dollars cash pick-up over the counter or direct transfer into their domiciliary accounts.\n\nAccording to him, the reward scheme is in line with the CBN\u2019s \u201cNaira4Dollar scheme\u201d aimed at encouraging inflow of Diaspora remittances into the country.\n\n\u201cRemittance services are a key aspect of our economy and it is still vibrant and viable today because people still take care of family members, loved ones, friends and invest at home even as they live abroad,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom all indications, the Naira4Dollar scheme has had a fair outing so far, hence when it comes up for review, the apex bank is expected to extend its timeline for the benefit of all the stakeholders, and in the overall interest of the economy.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nUnarguably, mental health conditions are similar among sufferers, irrespective of class, profession or other instances.\n\nSimilarly, neurologists note that mental health conditions experienced by military personnel are the same among the public, although transition from military to civil life may contribute to the frequency of the condition among military officers.\n\nAccording to them, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and substance abuse affect a significant minority of military personnel and veterans.\n\nBeside this assertion, a number of UK studies have found links between active service and mental health problems in armed service personnel involved in conflicts, wars and peace support operations across the globe.\n\nA very recent study of 10,000 serving personnel comprising 83 per cent regulars and 27 per cent reservists, found lower than expected levels of PTSD.\n\nNonetheless, neurologists insist that common mental disorders and alcohol misuse are the most frequently reported mental health problems among UK armed forces personnel.\n\nHowever, in Nigeria, military leadership has been engaged in restoring sanity at the continental level through the African Union (AU) medium and then regionally through the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) as we have seen over the years.\n\nThe armed forces have been involved in several internal security operations such as counter-insurgency operations in the North East, anti-banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and farmer-herder clashes operations in the North West and North Central part of the country.\n\nThe South East is currently troubled by the activities of a proscribed secession group, while the South-South and south-western parts are faced with the activities of oil thieves and economic saboteurs as well as kidnapping.\n\nThese issues and many more have led to massive deployment of military personnel to various theatres operation to combat the fore bearing menace which are likely to set the ground for trauma.\n\nAccording to experts, exposure to traumatic events, such as war, conflict, natural and human-made disasters, assault and life-threatening illnesses are common, with over two thirds of the general population likely to be exposed to a traumatic incident in their lifetime.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the Nigerian Army Officers\u2019 Wives Association (NAOWA) led by Mrs Fati Attahiru, conceived and initiated the establishment NAOWA Wellness Centre.\n\nThe centre is to provide services that will meet the mental, emotional and psychological needs of the military personnel, their families and the public.\n\nDuring the ground-breaking of the centre on April 26 at Mambilla Barracks in Asokoro Abuja, the President of NAOWA and wife of the chief of army staff, Mrs Attahiru, told the guests that she was conscious of the fact that grief, loss of a loved one, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, substance abuse and mental instability, among others, were all real, noting that the wellness centre would be a haven for them to speak out and collectively find solutions.\n\nAccording to her, the centre signifies hope and gives her the rare opportunity of taking the front seat to address an urgent need that will better the lives of the people.\n\nShe said that the initiative was borne out of several desperate calls from members of the barrack community and, in some cases, friends of the military who had directly or indirectly battled with depression and thoughts of suicide.\n\n\u201cI hope that by the end of this event, we would have been able to give you an insight to some of these issues and justify why this wellness centre is not a luxury but a place we urgently need.\n\n\u201cThis centre when completed will not only work closely with the Nigerian Army Medical Corps, it will go a step further to highlight the benefits of using the centre to its men and soldiers and encourage soldiers returning from war fronts to undergo sessions before reuniting with their families.\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that several families are broken due to the fact that soldiers are traumatised after returning from the battlefield.\n\n\u201cThis major problem is sorted because the directive from the chief of army staff holistically addresses the stigma associated with seeking help and I applaud him for making this happen,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nMrs Attahiru said that with NAOWA\u2019s strong support network and spread across all geopolitical zones, the wellness centre would be set up in at least each of the six geo-political zones to enable the barrack community to have seamless access.\n\nShe, however, solicited the support of and partnership with the government, state governors, corporate organisations and well-meaning individuals in the area of technical, financial and infrastructure to make the centre a reality, explaining that the centre would be ready for use in six months.\n\nThe speaker, House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, who performed the ground-breaking for the centre, commended NAOWA for the initiative and appreciated officers and soldiers of Nigerian Army who sacrificed their lives for the peace and security of the nation.\n\nGbajabiamila said that the project would provide opportunity for the Nigerian Army and the society to address the needs of the body and the mind of both serving and non-serving officers who had been involved in fighting wars.\n\nHe said that sickness, wellness and health were not just about the body or physical health but the mental and the soul, adding that the mind is more powerful than the body.\n\nAccording to him, wellness is an essential ingredient in living a healthy and fulfilling life, a healthy body and sound mind.\n\nThe speaker said that more than 50 million Nigerians were affected by mental illness as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other stress related issues and called for support from governors, legislators and other well-meaning Nigerians to support NAOWA\u2019s plan to have the centre in all the states of the federation.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, said the initiative would address preventive and curative as well as rehabilitative health, saying that the centre would not only serve the military but all of the society when completed.\n\nEhanire said that there were prevalent of physical and mental abuses leading to emotional and mental stress, which according to him, is understandable in the military because of the strain of the profession such as anxiety and survival issues.\n\nThe centre has attracted accolades from the wife of the president, Mrs Aisha Buhari, governors, members of the National Assembly and corporate organiations as well as well-meaning individuals who have described the initiative of NAOWA as timely and well-conceived.\n\nWhile some promised to support the project financially, some promised to offer strategic support and partnership to make the project a reality.(NANFeatures)\n\n...",

CIPM, Chartered Institute of Personnel Managers of Nigeria, is the umbrella body for the country\u2019s human resource professionals.\n\nThe Bank picked up two coveted awards, the \u2018People First CEO Award\u2019 and the \u2018People First Health and Safety Award\u2019, at the high-profile recognition ceremonies regarded as the \u201cOscars\u201d of Nigeria\u2019s Human Resources industry.\n\nBoth awards celebrate Abubakar Suleiman, Chief Executive Officer of Sterling Bank and the leadership of the Bank\u2019s Human Capital function, for putting employees first following the outbreak of the pandemic last year by ensuring a strong focus on the physical and mental health, welfare, and safety of employees.\n\nCIPMN presented the awards in partnership with the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), the chartered body and leading global membership organisation for safety and health professionals. IOSH is a champion, supporter, adviser, advocate, and trainer of those who protect the safety, health, and wellbeing of others.\n\nCommenting on the awards, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) of Sterling Bank, Temi Dalley, said, \u201cNavigating an unprecedented and globally challenging crisis such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was a defining moment for organisational leaders in 2020. We are favoured at Sterling to have an ingenious leader who operates with a remarkable balance of wisdom and empathy.\n\nOur CEO displayed an exemplary range in how he led Sterling through the abrupt and relentless changes that the pandemic heralded. He acted beyond the role of a Chief Executive Officer in this period and was our Chief Humanist Officer, Chief Protection Officer, and Chief Motivation Officer. He tasked himself with the overall wellbeing and continued productivity of over 4,000 employees that constitute the Sterling workforce through a difficult time, never navigated before.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dalley, in the immediate outbreak of the pandemic, Sterling Bank\u2019s first response was the \u201cgo home, stay home\u201d advisory to employees regardless of role or essentialism of function. Constantly, communication of the \u201cSafety before Service\u201d mandate set for all employees occurred through multiple channels, with leaders bringing its true meaning alive by example.\n\nThe Bank did not leave employees to deal with problems arising from the pandemic alone. Avenue was created to report perceived exposure or symptoms of COVID-19 to the Wellness Desk for advice on further actions, including isolation and testing at the Bank\u2019s designated centres with costs borne by the Bank.\n\nApart from tailoring its policies to protect pregnant employees, nursing parents, and those with underlying illnesses, the Bank also factored in the health, safety and wellbeing of their aged parents and relatives.\n\nSterling\u2019s response to the pandemic placed its people first and adequately created a balance between employee safety and continued optimum performance. Its mentally and physically healthy workforce, working either fully remote, shift, or on-site, is a testament to that. Additionally, the Bank\u2019s employee engagement trust index increased from 81% in 2019 to 87% in 2020 with no life and job loss due to the pandemic.",

          "text": "I give all adoration and honour to our grand progenitor, the almighty God, for this great privilege of life and opportunity to witness today; I recognise Mr John Carrilo, Chairman of Global Facility Management Practitioners, I also recognise the Chairman, Board of Trustees, Mr Stephen Jagun and the National President, Mr Collins Osayamwen.\n\nOther members of the association here present, distinguished ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI am greatly delighted to address this assemblage of noble professionals in the business of facility management, point-blanky, this is a nostalgic moment for me, being an active member of this association before my expedition to partisan politics.\n\nI, therefore, considered it a great honour to be given this opportunity of making a keynote address on this special occasion of the 2021 World Facility Management Day Commemoration in Nigeria, with the unique theme: \u2018STANDING TALL BEYOND THE PANDEMIC- THE ROLE OF STRATEGIC FACILITY MANAGEMENT\u2019.\n\nSincerely, the theme of the event would not have been more relevant and apt than now, considering the pervasive trend of the novel coronavirus and its devastating impact on the global socioeconomic wellbeing.\n\nMoreso, the scary surge in the number of cases in Asia and Southern America, particularly India and Brazil, in the couples of weeks back left a lot to be desired in the quest for social security and economic advancement in the developing economies of the world.\n\nIdentifying human cases with onset of symptoms in early December, 2019, at a wholesale food market in Wuhan, China, the deadly virus, apart of becoming a global menace and a pandemic by its strength of spread also changed the paradigm of world order and compelled the global community to opt for a new normal.\n\nOf course, the adverse effects of the pandemic have seriously put governments of the world on their toes, regarding adequacy and sufficiency of social infrastructure, especially in the health sector, without the exception of the so-called advanced economies and matured democracies of Northern America and Western Europe.\n\nAs the scourge of the pandemic puts much pressure on the global seats of power, to look inward and strategize for better future, this challenge also threatens the actualization and attainment of the 17 identified Sustainable Development Goals and its 169 targets, most especially the third goal, which is \u2018Good Health and Well-being\u2019.\n\nHowever, these challenges are surmountable going forward, with conscious deployment of \u201d Planning and Management\u201d, which remain the core of Strategic Facility Management.\n\nSince strategic facility management solely rooted in management and planning, with focus on a set of clear-cut goals on the long-term for better future, it is therefore a preferable path from the wilderness of pandemic to a promise land of social inclusion and pragmatic leadership at all levels of government.\n\nThe inherent philosophy of strategic facility management in the face of the pandemic will provide direction to political class to harness nations\u2019 resources to critical sectors of the economy, in line with their varying economic advantage theory.\n\nThis philosophy will essentially instill the discipline of frugal management of resources for greater outcome in the political players and the propensity to invest for rainy days and for rapid socioeconomic development.\n\nAlso, the instrument of planning and management will provide necessary ideological concept of technology-driven development, in tandem with global trend of developmental agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, this philosophy, intrinsically presents dimensional safety protocol of socioeconomic model, which goes beyond physical safety protocols of wearing masks and social distancing among many others.\n\nIt is indeed a \u2018Psychological Protocol of Survival\u2019 in the face of the pandemic and post-pandemic era. As a matter of importance and exigency, we must start to observe these psychological protocol, which is cognitive interpretation of the gains of the pandemic above its embedded adversity.\n\nIt is indeed fundamentally instructive for governments around the world to embark on advocacy of social reorientation for the purpose of reshaping the psyches of their citizens towards this psychological protocol of survival, as the pandemic continues to reappear in series with little or no potent solution in sight.\n\nOn a final note, I am happy to tell you that the deployment of the dual models of physical and psychological protocols of COVID-19 in the State of Osun, has helped us immensely to effectively manage the menace of coronavirus with resultant moderate cases and minimal fatality, despite the incursion of 127 returnees from Ivory Coast into the state at the peak of the outbreak.\n\nOur amiable Governor, Mr Adegboyega Oyetola and myself as the Chairman of the COVID-19 Task Force in the state, alongside members of the cabinet worked assiduously through proactive interventions to stem the tide of the ravaging virus.\n\nObviously, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to attain this feat without effective planning and management, as a robust tool for standing tall above the dreaded pandemic.\n\nI thank you so much for your rapt attention.\n\nBEING A KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY HIS\n\nEXCELLENCY, BENEDICT ALABI, OSUN\n\nSTATE DEPUTY GOVERNOR, AT THE 2021 WORLD FACILITY MANAGEMENT DAY COMMEMORATION IN NIGERIA, ORGANIZED BY ASSOCIATION OF FACILITY MANAGEMENT PRACTITIONERS IN NIGERIA.\n\nDATE: MAY 12, 2021\n\nVENUE: ONLINE",

The doctor who spoke with me said those who brought her said they were close to her and that she was not involved in any relationship. So why she did that to herself is what we are yet to know.\n\n\u201cWe will further react if we later know why she took that decision to take her own life.\u201d",

          "title": "Opinion: Lessons for Nigeria from EPL \u2013 By FEMI ADESINA",
          "text": "Manchester City football club was on Tuesday confirmed winner of the 2020/2021 English Premier League (EPL). For those who follow football keenly, whether it is played in the dusty fields of Ajegunle, in Lagos, the La Liga in Spain, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga, or EPL, this was one pulsating season, filled with excitement, despite the absence of physical spectators, due to the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs someone who gets his kick from football (from what do you get your\u2019s?) the fact that Manchester City got crowned champions three games to the end of the season, after Manchester United lost 1-2 at home to Leicester City, holds great significance even for our country, and what she is currently passing through. Unique lessons can be drawn, which can inspire us as a people.\n\nSince it was established in 1880, Manchester City was winning the League for the 7th time. Incidentally, five of the victories were in the past 10 years. Three of them are in four years, under the current coach, Pep Guardiola.\n\nEight weeks into this season that ends in another two weeks, Man City (as the team is popularly called) was Number 13 on the EPL table, which consists of 20 teams. And 38 games were to be played to complete the cycle.\n\nFans of the team were already hissing and cursing. Their opponents were gyrating and doing a jig, saying Man City was doomed for another season.\n\nRecall what happened in the 2019/2020 season. Man City was eyeing a treble. Three back-to-back seasons as champions, and a record in English football. But the adversaries knew the record that was to be set, so they arrayed themselves against the team. Just as some forces knew the record that was to be achieved by Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerian President, and which he had begun to show since 2015 when he got into office, and they positioned against the government.\n\nEvery team, big or small, strong or weak, set its sights on Man City last season, flexed muscles, summoned superhuman skills and strength whenever they were meeting the champions attempting a treble. The end result? Man City finished a distant second behind Liverpool, which had emerged like a thundering typhoon, to win the laurel in admirable fashion.\n\nThe lesson? When you are high-flying, the centrifugal forces will come against you, and it would only take the grace of God for you to attain. Yoruba people call those forces Aiye. When Aiye is on your case, as it was against Man City, and it is against the Buhari government, you need God, and God alone. Aiye (meaning \u2018the world,\u2019 if freely translated) is the negative part of mankind. The pernicious, baleful, sly and scheming part of humanity. If Aiye gets on your matter, you need God and God alone.\n\nMan City failed to make record last season. Because Aiye was there. Liverpool shot out like a bolt from the blues, and won the league for the first time after 30 years. It won new adherents to itself from different parts of the world. Buhari Amazon, Jewel Ifunaya Chika, was one of them. She simply ported from Manchester United, which she had been supporting for years, and pitched her tent with Liverpool. More about that team later.\n\nMan City failed to make record in 2019/2020 season. Aiye was in full force against it. And the 2020/2021 season was initially not looking promising either. Eight weeks gone, the team was placed 13th on the table. It had lost 2-5 to Leicester City at home in Etihad Stadium, Tottenham drubbed it by two goals, played draw with teams that couldn\u2019t hold a candle to it in the past, and was generally forlorn and limp. Aiye was having a ball, laughing Man City to scorn. Aren\u2019t they doing the same thing against the government in our country today, due to unrelenting security challenges, some of them possibly instigated by Aiye themselves?\n\nBut in November, the table turned for good for Man City, just as it would inexorably turn for Nigeria soon. The team beat Burnley by five goals to nothing, and it was the beginning of the turnaround. Victory came after victory, to the extent that the team was unbeaten in 21 consecutive games in the different competitions it was involved in. From the ashes, the Salamander had risen. Fire could not consume it, and today, Man City are champions, fifth time in 10 years.\n\nWho says Nigeria will not rise from its current travails? Who says Aiye will always win? Not where God is involved. And God is involved with Nigeria, our own dear native land. Under President Buhari, peace and security would be restored. The economy would rebound. Life would be abundant for the people , and Aiye would be left standing small, holding the rump of the flag of a country it thought had gone into oblivion. The winner takes it all, the loser standing small (apologies ABBA).\n\nIt was not glory ride for Man City all the way, however. It lost other crucial matches to Man U, newcomer Leeds United, and Chelsea. But did that alter the destiny for the season? No! Nigeria will also attain her destiny, and soon too. Amen, somebody!\n\nStill on the EPL, vital lessons too from Liverpool, the darling of the last two seasons. It first won the European Champions League, and then the Premiership. The team was simply radiating, making conquests and winning new followers. Till Aiye stepped into her case.\n\nLiverpool, which won the league last season by a wide margin, has been struggling in a pitiable way this season. It is exerting itself so strenuously, not for number one or two positions, but to end in number four, and book a place in the Champions League. What happened? Aiye went after the team, the way it did to Man City when the team was to set a record. This season, Liverpool has lost not less than eight games, most of them at its Anfield home, back to back. And to comparatively lowly teams. It was humiliated by Fulham (now gone into relegation), Brighton, Burnley, Southampton, and other minnows. Not to be forgotten is the 7-2 shellacking last October by Aston Villa, and the 4-1 pounding by Man City in February. Thy glory oh Liverpool is slain upon the high places. How are the mighty fallen! Just because of Aiye.\n\nLiverpool crashed out of the Champions League, losing to Real Madrid, which Chelsea came to beat home and away. On the day it was poised to change position on the league table, making a 4th placement sure, it was leading Newcastle till the very last minute of the game, when it suddenly crumbled. The opponents drew level in the 95th minute, the very last seconds of added time. Aiye in action.\n\nMan City bounced back from the ashes to emerge victors. It has won the Carabao Cup this season, and may win the Champions League on May 29, if her luck holds. Liverpool would be back someday soon. Just as Nigeria would confound the enemies, and it would happen under Buhari\u2019s leadership. The Good Book has said it, in Micah 7:8: \u201cRejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall rise again.\u201d\n\nMan City rose. Liverpool will rise. Nigeria will rise. And Aiye would lose. And fall flat on its face.\n\nI can hear the Amen.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The end result? Man City finished a distant second behind Liverpool, which had emerged like a thundering typhoon, to win the laurel in admirable fashion.\n\nThe lesson? When you are high-flying, the centrifugal forces will come against you, and it would only take the grace of God for you to attain. Yoruba people call those forces Aiye. When Aiye is on your case, as it was against Man City, and it is against the Buhari government, you need God, and God alone. Aiye (meaning \u2018the world,\u2019 if freely translated) is the negative part of mankind. The pernicious, baleful, sly and scheming part of humanity. If Aiye gets on your matter, you need God and God alone.\n\nMan City failed to make record last season. Because Aiye was there. Liverpool shot out like a bolt from the blues, and won the league for the first time after 30 years. It won new adherents to itself from different parts of the world. Buhari Amazon, Jewel Ifunaya Chika, was one of them. She simply ported from Manchester United, which she had been supporting for years, and pitched her tent with Liverpool. More about that team later.\n\nMan City failed to make record in 2019/2020 season. Aiye was in full force against it. And the 2020/2021 season was initially not looking promising either. Eight weeks gone, the team was placed 13th on the table. It had lost 2-5 to Leicester City at home in Etihad Stadium, Tottenham drubbed it by two goals, played draw with teams that couldn\u2019t hold a candle to it in the past, and was generally forlorn and limp. Aiye was having a ball, laughing Man City to scorn. Aren\u2019t they doing the same thing against the government in our country today, due to unrelenting security challenges, some of them possibly instigated by Aiye themselves?\n\nBut in November, the table turned for good for Man City, just as it would inexorably turn for Nigeria soon. The team beat Burnley by five goals to nothing, and it was the beginning of the turnaround. Victory came after victory, to the extent that the team was unbeaten in 21 consecutive games in the different competitions it was involved in. From the ashes, the Salamander had risen. Fire could not consume it, and today, Man City are champions, fifth time in 10 years.\n\nWho says Nigeria will not rise from its current travails? Who says Aiye will always win? Not where God is involved. And God is involved with Nigeria, our own dear native land. Under President Buhari, peace and security would be restored. The economy would rebound. Life would be abundant for the people , and Aiye would be left standing small, holding the rump of the flag of a country it thought had gone into oblivion. The winner takes it all, the loser standing small (apologies ABBA).\n\nIt was not glory ride for Man City all the way, however. It lost other crucial matches to Man U, newcomer Leeds United, and Chelsea. But did that alter the destiny for the season? No! Nigeria will also attain her destiny, and soon too. Amen, somebody!\n\nStill on the EPL, vital lessons too from Liverpool, the darling of the last two seasons. It first won the European Champions League, and then the Premiership. The team was simply radiating, making conquests and winning new followers. Till Aiye stepped into her case.\n\nLiverpool, which won the league last season by a wide margin, has been struggling in a pitiable way this season. It is exerting itself so strenuously, not for number one or two positions, but to end in number four, and book a place in the Champions League. What happened? Aiye went after the team, the way it did to Man City when the team was to set a record. This season, Liverpool has lost not less than eight games, most of them at its Anfield home, back to back. And to comparatively lowly teams. It was humiliated by Fulham (now gone into relegation), Brighton, Burnley, Southampton, and other minnows. Not to be forgotten is the 7-2 shellacking last October by Aston Villa, and the 4-1 pounding by Man City in February. Thy glory oh Liverpool is slain upon the high places. How are the mighty fallen! Just because of Aiye.\n\nLiverpool crashed out of the Champions League, losing to Real Madrid, which Chelsea came to beat home and away. On the day it was poised to change position on the league table, making a 4th placement sure, it was leading Newcastle till the very last minute of the game, when it suddenly crumbled. The opponents drew level in the 95th minute, the very last seconds of added time. Aiye in action.\n\nMan City bounced back from the ashes to emerge victors. It has won the Carabao Cup this season, and may win the Champions League on May 29, if her luck holds. Liverpool would be back someday soon. Just as Nigeria would confound the enemies, and it would happen under Buhari\u2019s leadership. The Good Book has said it, in Micah 7:8: \u201cRejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall rise again.\u201d\n\nMan City rose. Liverpool will rise. Nigeria will rise. And Aiye would lose. And fall flat on its face.\n\nI can hear the Amen.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday pledged said his administration is working hard to tackle insecurity confronting the nation and he hopes Nigerians understand.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the State House shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast, President Buhari said that the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Watching Israel-Palestine Conflict With \u2018Great Concern\u2019 \u2013 Foreign Ministry\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against the bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHe said his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.\n\n\u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources. For example, when we came in, in the Northeast, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest and we are dealing with it,\u201d said the President.\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, President Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\nHe also commended the National Assembly for its support, saying that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari then made an appeal to the nation\u2019s elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers. It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, the Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members, and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.",

          "text": "Israel faced an escalating conflict on two fronts Thursday, scrambling to quell riots between Arabs and Jews on its own streets after days of exchanging deadly fire with Palestinian militants in Gaza.\n\nDespite diplomatic efforts to halt the violence, which US President Joe Biden said he hoped would end \u201csooner than later\u201d, hundreds of rockets tore through the skies over the Gaza Strip overnight.\n\nIsrael\u2019s civil aviation authority said it had diverted all incoming passenger flights headed for Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport to Ramon airport in the south, due to the rocket fire.\n\nAir raid warnings went off across Israel, including in the country\u2019s north for the first time in years \u2014 which the army later said was a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d.\n\nIsrael\u2019s air force launched multiple strikes, targeting what it described as locations linked to the \u201ccounterintelligence infrastructure\u201d of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, as well as the house of Iyad Tayeb, one of the movement\u2019s commanders.\n\nIn Gaza, 67 people have been killed so far \u2014 including 17 children \u2014 and nearly 400 wounded in days of near relentless Israeli air strikes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hamas announced the death of its military chief in Gaza City, Bassem Issa, with the Israeli military saying it had killed three other senior figures as well.\n\nIsraeli strikes also destroyed a tower block housing Palestinian television channel Al-Aqsa, set up by Hamas.\n\nIsrael said Palestinian militants had launched around 1,600 rockets into its territory since Monday evening.\n\nSeven people have been killed, including one six-year-old after a rocket struck the family home in southern Israel, the United Hatzalah volunteer rescue service said.\n\nThe past few days have seen the most intense hostilities in seven years between Israel and Gaza\u2019s armed groups, triggered by weekend unrest at Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews.\n\n\u2018Pogrom\u2019\n\nCoinciding with the aerial bombardments is surging violence between Arabs and Jews inside Israel.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Israeli far-right groups took to the streets across the country, clashing with security forces and Arab Israelis.\n\nPolice said they had responded to violent incidents in multiple towns, including Lod, Acre and Haifa, confirming 374 arrests shortly past midnight.\n\nIsraeli television aired footage of a far-right mob beating a man they considered an Arab until he lay unconscious on his back in a street in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cThe victim of the lynching is seriously injured but stable,\u201d Tel Aviv\u2019s Ichilov Hospital said, without identifying him.\n\nA state of emergency has been declared in the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod, where a synagogue and other Jewish property has been torched and an Arab resident was shot dead.\n\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin, in unusually strong language, denounced what he described as a \u201cpogrom\u201d in which \u201can incited and bloodthirsty Arab mob\u201d had injured people and attacked sacred Jewish spaces.\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian man was killed during a confrontation with Israeli soldiers near the northern city of Nablus, the Palestinian health ministry said Thursday.\n\nThe death brings the number killed in clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in the West Bank to three on Wednesday alone.\n\n\u201cWhat has been happening these last few days in Israeli towns is unacceptable\u2026 Nothing justifies the lynching of Arabs by Jews and nothing justifies the lynching of Jews by Arabs,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, adding that Israel was fighting a battle \u201con two fronts\u201d.\n\nStalled diplomacy\n\nThe UN Security Council has already held two closed-door videoconferences since Monday, with the United States \u2014 a close Israel ally \u2014 opposing adoption of a joint declaration, which it said would not \u201chelp de-escalate\u201d the situation.\n\nNetanyahu spoke later Wednesday with Biden, who said: \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, urging an end to the rocket attacks.\n\nBlinken had said earlier that a US envoy would travel to the Middle East to seek to calm tensions.\n\nBut the Israeli government has warned that \u201cthis is only the beginning\u201d, and military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said strikes on Gaza would continue as Israel prepares for \u201cmultiple scenarios\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have ground units that are prepared and are in various stages of preparing ground operations,\u201d he told reporters Thursday.\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has also threatened to step up attacks, warning that \u201cif Israel wants to escalate, we are ready for it\u201d.\n\nThe crisis flared last Friday when weeks of tensions boiled over and Israeli riot police clashed with crowds of Palestinians at Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa mosque compound.\n\nNightly disturbances have since gripped Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, leaving more than 900 Palestinians injured, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nThe unrest has been driven by anger over the looming evictions of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of east Jerusalem.",

          "text": "The UK\u2019s Daily Mail is reporting that Zinedine Zidane will almost certainly leave Real Madrid at the end of this season, regardless of whether they win La Liga.\n\nThey face Granada Thursday night and if they pick up a victory they will still be two points behind Atletico Madrid with two games to go.\n\nBut the 48-year-old coach, who has won two league titles and three Champions League crowns in less than four seasons, has all but made up his mind to walk away after the final game of the campaign at home to Villarreal on May 23.\n\nZidane will be an immediate target for Juventus and for the France national side if they make a change after the Euros this summer.\n\nMadrid president Florentino Perez will be under pressure to promote Raul to replace him. He currently has the club\u2019s youth team on the verge of promotion but Perez could also turn to Max Allegri.\n\nZidane has sensed for some time that he no longer has the backing of Perez and even a third league title, one that will make him the first coach to retain the league for Madrid since Leo Beenhakker in 1989, is unlikely to change his mind.\n\nZidane has maintained he has the overwhelming support of the dressing room this season and a disagreement this week with left-back Marcelo, leading to him being left out of the squad for tonight\u2019s game, is not at the heart of the coach\u2019s discontent.\n\nThe Brazilian will be off at the end of the season anyway. Their falling-out is being seen more as a symptom than a cause of what looks like an imminent divorce.\n\nMarcelo believed Zidane was overly critical of a recent Real Madrid training session when he had urged his players to prepare with more intensity for a must-win game.\n\nHe spoke back to the manager in front of the squad and has been omitted from the trip to Granada.\n\nMarcelo may not have played anyway because despite having depleted options in defence for tonight\u2019s game, Zidane was considering picking promising 19-year-old Miguel Gutierrez to start.\n\nThe young players who have emerged in recent weeks are now the only thing that could keep Zidane at Madrid.\n\nIf he is persuaded to build a new team around Gutierrez, centre-back Victor Chust, midfielders Sergio Arribas and Antonio Blanco, with the prospect of the club continuing its pursuit of Kylian Mbappe, then his mind could be changed.\n\nBut he does not believe there is a will in the Real Madrid boardroom to convince him to stay.\n\nMadrid have threadbare resources going into tonight\u2019s game. Alvaro Odriozola, Eder Militao, Nacho Fernandez and Gutierrez will be the back four because they are the last four fit defenders.\n\nZidane\u2019s midfield trinity of Toni Kroos, Casemiro and Luka Modric are fit to start alongside another of his favourites, the Uruguayan midfielder Fede Valverde. And he must decide between Marco Asensio and Eden Hazard to partner Karim Benzema.\n\nIf Madrid are beaten, then Atletico could clinch the league by winning at home to Osasuna this Sunday.",

          "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is \u201canxious\u201d about a rise in the UK of the coronavirus variant first identified in India.\n\nA closely-monitored study of infections in England found the variant is becoming more prevalent just ahead of the next big easing of lockdown restrictions.\n\n\u201cIt is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe want to make sure we take all the prudential, cautious steps now that we could take, so there are meetings going on today to consider exactly what we need to do. There is a range of things we could do; we are ruling nothing out.\u201d\n\nIn its latest assessment published Thursday, Imperial College London said overall cases have fallen to their lowest level since August following a strict lockdown and a successful rollout of vaccines. However, it warned that the Indian variant should be closely monitored.\n\nThe so-called REACT study found that the Indian variant, designated \u201cof concern\u201d because it could be more transmissible, was identified in 7.7% of the 127,000 cases tested between Apr.15 and May 3.\n\nProfessor Steven Riley from Imperial College said it\u2019s unclear whether the Indian variant is more transmissible but warned that \u201cthis is a risk.\u201d\n\nThough the British government and scientists have said new cases may start to go up in coming weeks, it\u2019s unclear whether that will lead to a big increase in hospitalizations and deaths given that most of those people deemed vulnerable have been vaccinated.\n\nOver the past few weeks as India has suffered a catastrophic resurgence of the virus, concerns have grown around the world about potential new variants bypassing the protections offered by vaccines.\n\nAcross the UK, lockdown restrictions are being lifted. The next easing in England is set to take place on Monday when two households will be able to mix indoors and pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers inside, among other changes. The other nations of the UK\u2014 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 have also laid out similar plans for the coming weeks.\n\nThe government hopes to lift most remaining restrictions on social contact in June.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, I can see nothing that dissuades me from thinking we will be able to go ahead on Monday and indeed on June 21, everywhere, but there may be things we have to do locally and we will not hesitate to do them if that is the advice we get,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe government\u2019s scientific advisory committee, known as SAGE, will be making recommendations about the pandemic\u2019s path. It is due to meet later.\n\nCurrently there are few signs the previous easing has led to an increase in new infections, which are averaging around 2,000 a day across the UK, compared with nearly 70,000 recorded in January at the peak of the second wave.",
