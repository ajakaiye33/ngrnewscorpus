          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2014SSANU leadership under pressure to declare a strike\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nINDICATION emerged on Sunday that the non-teaching staff in the universities are mounting pressure on their leadership to declare industrial dispute following the alleged Federal Government failure to keep to the April timeline for the implementation of the Memorandum of Action, MoA it entered with the unions.\n\nThe union members have lamented that after about 14 months the Consequential Adjustment for the new minimum wage came into effect, the government was yet to start its implementation.\n\nBut Vanguard reliably gathered that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige has promised to intervene in order to avert the looming strike.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the weekend, the President of the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities, SSANU, Comrade Mohammed Haruna Ibrahim confirmed the pressure from his members to resume strike.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe met with government some few months ago and we had an understanding after going on strike for three weeks. A lot of pressure was put on us; a lot of persuasions and we talked with the government and saw the reason to suspend the strike because the government tried to paint the picture of being sincere and we needed to give them an opportunity to do one or two things to ensure that our demands are met.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, our demands are not new demands. These are things that have been lingering for eleven years. We had an agreement with the government in 2009 and till today, a lot of such issues are still lagging behind; especially things that involve some payments of our allowances.\n\n\u201cWe saw reasons to suspend because we felt the government was sincere and the timelines given by government \u2013 not us was that by end of April most of these issues will be sorted. We still believe a miracle can happen.\n\n\u201cOutside that a lot of our members are agitated, we are under a lot of pressure to go back to the trenches because even when we called our members to interact with them with pressed on them to give the government a chance.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that government will not disappoint us and paint us like liars before our members. Where the government doesn\u2019t meet the timeline one cannot guarantee industrial peace because we have been taken for a ride for too long.\n\n\u201cOut of the seven issues we tabled before government three or four have been handled. For example the issue of the visitation panel: currently the panels are all over the universities. The issue of discrepancies in our salaries is also being handled by the IPPIS committee.\n\n\u201cBut payment of the consequential adjustments for the new national minimum wage and the allowances that are encapsulated in our agreements contained in the earned allowance; these are still things that are lagging behind and there is no end in sight, to say the least.\n\n\u201cWhile the government has attempted to address some of the problems the ones that touch us directly- the ones that involve our pockets have not been addressed. Because of the insecurity inflation has skyrocketed. The prices of items have changed. Our members the little they get as salaries cannot even take them home. By the time you make a few purchases money is gone.\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the government to ensure that they don\u2019t embarrass us as elders in our different unions, that all those agreements we have reached with them which they promise that they will see the light of day by the end of April come to see the light of the day but where it doesn\u2019t, out hands are also tied as leaders.\n\n\u201cWe never called off the strike, we only suspended it meaning that our notice is still with the government but by the expiration of this Memorandum of Action, all we need do is to call our people and inform them that government has failed us and they will tell us the next line of action to take.\n\n\u201cFor us, in SSANU we are not struck mongers, we believe in engagements. Even when we went on strike it lasted for three weeks and because we believe that things can be done differently but where we are pushed to the wall we may have no reason other than to react.\n\n\u201cAs I told you some of the issues we have with government \u2013 all the non-monetary aspect are being handled. Clearly, we have seen it but where it concerns giving out money to members who are paying their dues by working is where the government is reneging.\n\n\u201cFor example, the payment of the consequential adjustment, the implementation of the EA in our salaries \u2013 these are the areas government is still lagging behind and the issue of non-remittance of pension deductions. Our members who have retired cannot access their money that has been collected on their behalf and lodged in the PFAs. This is a very pathetic situation.\n\n\u201cThese are the areas government is still lagging behind and they have promised that we should give them up to the end of April by which time the consequential adjustments would have been paid, the EA would have been implemented alongside our salaries that are paid monthly. These are the areas we are still having issues with the government.\u201d\n\nIt was reliably gathered that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Ngige has promised to wade into the matter to ensure that it didn\u2019t lead to a strike.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Southsouth geo-political zone is not spared by the escalating insecurity. Southsouth Bureau Chief BISI OLANIYI; OKUNGBOWA AIWERIE; ELO EDREMODA; POLYCARP OROSEVWOTU; MIKE ODIEGWU; ROSEMARY NWISI; NSA GILL; BASSEY ANTHONY and SIMON UTEBOR report that the region has known no peace in recent times and the development has been attributed to different factors\n\nRelative peace had returned to the Niger Delta region, which includes the six states of the Southsouth geo-political zone, following the implementation of the amnesty programme by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in 2009. But, in recent times, the region has been experiencing some level of insecurity across the various states.\n\nIPOB infiltrating Rivers:\n\nThe security situation in Rivers State, which has been on the edge since last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests further degenerated recently with unimaginable attacks on security formations by gunmen identified by security agencies as members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The gunmen, who came in their numbers from neighbouring states destroyed the Police Area Command and station in Oyigbo Local Government Area (LGA), killing four policemen and five soldiers. They burnt vehicles and set the Magistrate Court in the area ablaze.\n\nThough, the Rivers State government and security commanders have rolled out strategies to restore peace in the troubled council, there has been foreboding that the gunmen could spring surprise attacks in other parts of the state. For instance, a few days ago, over 70 gunmen raided checkpoints along the busy Port Harcourt-Owerri Road and killed eight security operatives. The gunmen attacked four checkpoints from Elele to Omagwa in Ikwerre LGA.\n\nOut of the eight operatives killed, three were said to be military personnel; three Customs officials and two policemen. Some were reportedly beheaded, while others were burnt beyond recognition. The bandits gained entry into Omagwa and Elele through the border towns in neighbouring Imo State. They marched through the bush paths and swooped on innocent security men on duty.\n\nA police situation report identified the gunmen as members of IPOB. One of the attacked checkpoints located along Airport Road, Omagwa, belonged to the Joint Task Force (JTF) and was manned by nine policemen and two soldiers.\n\nThe bandits later invaded a checkpoint of the Nigeria Customs Service at Isiokpo, killing three customs officials. The hoodlums carted away the rifles of the security operatives and their patrol vans with sirens. They advanced to attack the Police Area Command at Isiokpo, but were repelled by gallant policemen on duty. A combined team of security operatives immediately launched a manhunt for the fleeing gunmen.\n\nWhile the authorities were still searching for the marauders, gunmen struck again, killing five soldiers on duty. The gunmen attacked the soldiers at Abua/Odual LGA.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and the security commanders were jolted by the emerging trend, compelling them to engage in marathon emergency meetings. In search of solutions, the governor after one of the meetings resolved to impose a curfew on all the state\u2019s borders. Initially, the curfew started at 8 p.m. at the borders Rivers shares with Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa and Imo states. Wike insisted that the action was necessitated by the recent security breaches and deadly attacks on security personnel by unidentified gunmen.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Government of Rivers State has decided to restrict night movements into and out of the state from the land borders of the state. Consequently, a night curfew is hereby imposed and no person or vehicle is allowed into and out of Rivers State from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., from April 28, 2021, until further notice.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, the Rivers State governor reviewed the curfew, following new intelligence, by imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the entire state. He said it became imperative for the state government to take further necessary measures to secure Rivers State and safeguard lives and property. He said: \u201cAccordingly, the State Security Council has, after exhaustive deliberations, decided and advised that a statewide curfew on human and vehicular movements be imposed, as part of additional measures to prevent the faceless criminals from unleashing their deadly actions.\n\n\u201cConsequently, a night curfew is hereby imposed on the entire 23 LGAs, prohibiting any human and/or vehicular movement within or any part of the state from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m., from today, April 29, 2021, until further notice.\u201d\n\nWike also urged the people to be vigilant and promptly report every suspicious movement in their neighbourhoods to the security agencies, for immediate actions.\n\nA serving senior official of the Department of State Services (DSS), who spoke in confidence disclosed that security issues in the Southsouth zone could only be prevented through intelligence gathering, but he lamented that despite knowing the importance of intelligence in security management, the government was not interested in it.\n\nHe said just like the President, the governors were only interested in intelligence linked to them and their family members but would \u201cpass away\u201d any intelligence that did not affect them. The top DSS official blamed the rising insecurity on the collapse of intelligence gathering.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe only known way to guarantee security in any part of the world is intelligence gathering. The government knows this, but has paid lip service and totally neglected this critical aspect of maintaining the security of lives and property. What has been happening over the years is a politicisation of intelligence gathering. Intelligence is only good when it affects the governors and the President, as well as their family members. But when it does not serve their personal interest, the intelligence is \u2018passed away\u2019 and treated as if it never existed.\n\n\u201cWe (DSS operatives) have the capacity to infiltrate the ranks of bandits, IPOB, major kidnap gangs and even the Boko Haram insurgents, but they (senior government officials) will not do it, because they are not interested in it.\u201d\n\nOwing to the recent development, the Rivers State Neighbourhood Safety Corps (RSNSC), which was inaugurated in 2018, but was not allowed to take off by the military, has resumed operations. Its Director-General, Dr. Uche Chukwuma confirmed that the local security arrangement had just resumed operation.\n\nA retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG), Valentine Ntomchukwu said the entire Southsouth zone was suffering from years of police neglect.\n\nHe said the only way to guarantee security in the zone was to equip the police with modern policing tools, adding that handing over only AK-47 rifles, without other necessary gadgets would never guarantee the safety of the personnel and the security of the zone.\n\nNtomchukwu said: \u201cWe should build our police to give them the capacity to respond to internal problems in the zone. The police have been neglected for decades and if we do not start now, to build the police, there will continue to be a gap in internal security, because the police are the lead agency. We have had reforms after reforms and white paper after white paper, but they remain largely unimplemented. This is why we are having these results. Police capacity must be built holistically. Police need to be decentralised and funded.\u201d\n\nThe retired DIG also stated that the area commanders, commissioners of police and zonal heads must have the capacity to help and complement one another, pointing out that as currently structured none of them had the capacity to match the dynamism of the society.\n\nHe declared that policemen were being killed because they lacked the capacity, equipment and gadgets to protect themselves, especially during unexpected attacks, regretting that even policemen in the lines of duty had no bulletproof vests to ward off arsenal directed at them in an ambush.\n\nNtomchukwu said the conditions of police offices and stations speak volumes of the magnitude of lacks plaguing their operations. He added that unless drastic actions were taken to reposition the force, policemen would continue to lack the capacity to discharge their functions.\n\nSome of Governor Wike\u2019s kinsmen, under the auspices of the Ikwerre People\u2019s Congress (IPC), also pleaded with the Federal Government to identify, arrest and prosecute persons behind the emerging terrorism in the Southeast and Southsouth zones.\n\nWhile condemning the resurgent attacks on security operatives, the IPC convener, Livingstone Wechie said it was a desecration of the entire state. He declared that it was time for the governors to activate intelligence networks to isolate and arrest persons behind the emerging trend.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPC wishes to state that Ikwerre being a lead ethnic nationality in Nigeria and in the lower Niger owes a leadership obligation to give direction and hereby charge the Federal Government, as well as the governments of the Southsouth and the Southeast states to consciously and proactively boost and activate intelligence, as a measure to arrest these avoidable attacks and multiple killings in our region.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe duty and primary purpose of government to protect lives and property remains sacrosanct and cannot be compromised. IPC cautions that the attempt by the enemy forces to create tension, destabilise and hold an artificial atmosphere of insurgency in this region must be contained, without further delay.\n\n\u201cWhile the government should take necessary actions accordingly, knowing that it has requisite capacity, it is, however, strongly advised that the government should avoid the temptation of unwarranted force and reprisal in addressing these issues, with a view to ensuring justice, peace and development in our region, particularly bearing the innocent citizens in mind.\u201d\n\nIPC also stated that Ikwerre land or any part of the East, particularly the entire Niger Delta, would not be conquered or made a victim of genocide.\n\nInsecurity in Rivers State is no doubt on the rise, but the state\u2019s police command has assured the residents that it is committed to curb it. Its spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police (SP), assured that the command was doing everything possible to ensure that the lives and property of Rivers people were saved. He said: \u201cWe are not going to discuss our security strategies in the media, but we are on top of the situation in Rivers State.\u201d\n\nOmoni also called on members of the public to support and cooperate with the police by divulging useful information to security agencies, while staying security conscious and observing all personal security tips, being championed by the police.\n\nHoodlums on rampage:\n\nThe hitherto peaceful Edo State suddenly became notorious for criminal activities, with the October 19, 2020 jailbreaks at the Maximum Correctional Centre, popularly referred to as While House, on Sapele Road and the Oko Medium Correctional Centre on Airport Road, both in Benin City, during the #EndSARS protests that were hijacked by hoodlums, thereby leading to the escape of 1,993 inmates, mostly condemned criminals, who immediately returned to crime.\n\nPrior to attacking the correctional centres and setting free the inmates, the hoodlums first razed seven police stations in Edo State and carted away huge arms and ammunition, police uniforms and other valuables, while also setting ablaze the patrol vans and other vehicles parked at the police\u2019s facilities. For many months, the displaced policemen and the Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) were operating from the police headquarters, near Government House, Benin, since they had no office or patrol van to work with, before they were later redeployed to other police formations.\n\nThe Edo jailbreaks and looting/razing of the seven police stations made kidnapping, armed robbery, cultism and other criminals activities to be on the increase in the state, with the Benin-Ekpoma-Auchi-Abuja road now turned into a no-go route by kidnappers, who abduct innocent travellers on a daily basis, with huge ransoms being paid before the victims would regain their freedom, while the women would be gang-raped by the dirty kidnappers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost kidnappers and other criminals from neighbouring states, mostly Ondo, who felt the heat from the no-nonsense governors decided to relocate to Edo, thereby heightening insecurity and tension in the state. For instance, the police arrested 357 suspects for kidnapping, armed robbery, cultism, murder, rape, burglary, attempted murder and other criminal activities two weeks ago. The suspected criminals were subsequently paraded by Edo Police Commissioner, Phillip Ogbadu, with a large cache of arms and ammunition recovered from the suspects also displayed.\n\nOgbadu said: \u201cThe command is faced with violent crimes of kidnapping, armed robbery, cultism, murder, rape and burglary, among others. As such, the command has continued to devise security strategies to prevent criminal activities and to ensure a secure, safe and stable environment for economic growth and social interaction. It has also continued to adopt due diligence, intelligence system of administration, robust tactical operations and ensuring that cases are properly investigated and prosecuted.\u201d\n\nThe Edo police commissioner also disclosed that the command had continued to work with vigilance and hunter groups in the host communities, which he said was geared towards building people\u2019s confidence in Nigeria police for information sharing. He said: \u201cI want to use this medium to once again appreciate the cooperation received from Edo State Government, under the leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and the good people of Edo State, since my assumption of office, in our efforts to make sure that the state is safe and secure.\u201d\n\nOgbadu also called on all stakeholders to assist the police and other security agencies to make the state a peaceful and secure environment.\n\nA Benin-based human rights activist, Kola Edokpayi said the government must find ways to provide employment opportunities for the teeming qualified youths. He also called for community policing as one of the solutions to end insecurity in the country. He said security must be everybody\u2019s business because states and the Federal Government alone cannot handle security in the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cTo ensure adequate security in Nigeria, emphasis must be placed on the provision of employment opportunities, tackling poverty and encouraging community policing, while President Muhammadu Buhari should stop being clannish and henceforth also avoid double standard.\u201d\n\nThe human rights activist also declared that President Buhari had failed abysmally to provide adequate security for Nigerians and their property. He urged the President to wake up to prevent another civil war that may be worse than that of 1967 to 1970, where millions of innocent persons lost their lives.\n\nUnemployment, job creation:\n\nSome security experts in Delta State have blamed rising insecurity in the region on poverty, youth unemployment and social injustice. A former Commissioner of Police in the state, Ikechukwu Aduba and a retired Commander of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Desmond Agwu urged the Federal Government to tackle youth unemployment, stressing that many youths were lured into crime, largely due to unemployment.\n\nThey said terrorist groups and bandits are enticing the mostly unemployed youths with fantastic monetary offers that ensure a steady supply of willing foot-soldiers, while urging the government to improve on the parlous economy.\n\nAduba and Agwu said violent crimes cannot be tackled only by the force of arms, stressing that social justice must be factored into the equation, for better results. In separate interviews, they called for an overhaul of the security architecture to ensure that the drift was halted.\n\nThey said Nigeria is under policed. Aduba said: \u201cWith personnel strength of a little over 400,000, the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) lacks the numerical strength to tackle rising insecurity across the country, especially in the Southsouth states.\n\n\u201cGovernment should discontinue the practice of using the military to fight internal security. Well-trained and better-equipped policemen are preferable to combat internal threats. The Federal Government must also invest in the use of modern weaponry and equipment, in order to effectively fight violent crimes. With the numerous water bodies, gunboats are a necessity. Low morale among police personnel is also an issue, following repeated attacks on them. I wish to plead with both states and federal governments to address poor remuneration and welfare, for effective policing.\u201d\n\nAduba also called for the rehabilitation of several police training schools across the country, through injection of funds. He equally advocated for massive investment in the welfare of policemen. The former commissioner of police said proper funding of the Nigeria police would go a long way in checking banditry and other violent crimes.\n\nAgwu said the issue of poverty could not be overemphasised because many youths resort to crime out of frustration borne out of joblessness. He urged Southsouth states and the Federal Government to create a thriving economy to support industries, so as to employ a large number of graduates churned out annually from the country\u2019s tertiary institutions.\n\nThe retired commander of NSCDC admonished top officials of the Federal Government to resuscitate moribund refineries in the Southsouth zone, in order to stem the tide of youths\u2019 unemployment. He said: \u201cThe way forward is for governments, both states and federal, to provide jobs for the teeming population. If the government is able to provide jobs for youths in the Niger Delta region, the issue of bombings and killings will stop.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former Minister of Police Affairs, Alaowei Broderick Bozimo said the government should adequately equip \u201cidle\u201d youths to patrol the forests in the area. In an interview with The Nation, Bozimo reechoed the call for state police, adding that the current level of insecurity could not be centrally controlled. He also rejected the suggestion that Nigeria should employ foreign mercenaries to help address its security challenges. In his view, controlling them may become a problem, \u201cas they could lose the agenda, as is the present case\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that the Boko Haram insurgency started after the assassination of the founder of the group, Mohammed Yusuf. He said: \u201cState police will be able to concentrate their efforts on the marauding attackers, Boko Haram fighters and the criminal herdsmen, among others. The state police will be able to identify and isolate them, because of their knowledge of the local community, thereby dealing decisively with them. Of course, you must fund and train the policemen.\n\nMore policemen, equipment needed:\n\n\u201cOur problem is that we do not have enough policemen. When I was a minister, the police population was about 400, 000, more than 10 years ago. When you ask the authorities, they keep repeating the same statistics. That is ridiculous. So, you must increase the number of policemen or soldiers and give them adequate training and equipment. Our policemen and soldiers are well trained. So, it is the equipment and welfare packages that they need. Make them look like a serious force, not the rag-tag army that is a bunch of jokes for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe Nigerians must make our own inputs and contributions. We always make the police a laughing stock and ridicule them. Honestly, we do not have any other police than the Nigeria police. The police generally reflect the kind of society they find themselves in. So, we have a duty to empathise with them and assist them. The present Police Trust Fund (PTF) that is in place, I hope it is being properly funded. I can remember we pushed this concept during my tenure and we did not quite get it right then. But now, I hope it is got right. With new strategies, I believe we will get improved results.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the Southsouth zone, the governors have been trying to work out a similar security outfit like the Amotekun in the Southwest zone. If the Federal Government is able to allow state police, then all they need is to cooperate and see how they can coordinate the efforts of their various policies. Cooperation is the keyword. You know that in the Southsouth, kidnapping is just a new thing. Kidnapping, as you know is just an avenue people use to make money. Like the organised criminals, when they are running out of funds, they will kidnap a few people and coerce relatives to pay huge amounts of funds as ransoms.\n\n\u201cIt is so painful, what is happening in universities and other schools, where children are kidnapped and parents and government are forced to pay ransoms. Kidnapping is relatively new to our interiors in the Southsouth, but it can be managed, once we have a coordinated security system, where the people are serious, the people are paid properly and they have sufficient vehicles to patrol the areas, especially our forests.\n\n\u201cIn those days, we had some helicopters we used for patrol. We should now purchase more helicopters. Drones can be employed, but more importantly, we should have our people who know the forests, well equipped to go around physically. Now that kidnapping is getting quite prominent all over the country, it was not so serious in the Southsouth, except during the early militancy years. But now, it is all over the place.\n\n\u201cWe are from the thick forest area, not like the Savannah. What happens is these kidnappers and Boko Haram criminals just take our people, young and old, into the forests. If we engage our youths, who are mostly idle-handed now, they know the terrain. Pay them well, equip them and let them go in groups and comb the entire forests and get the criminals arrested. The bushes are meant for farming, but these are the bushes where the kidnappers and other criminals hide their victims and cause trouble. So, if the forests are patrolled like Amotekun is trying to do, in the Southsouth and all over the country, I think we would have good results.\u201d\n\nFailure of leadership:\n\nA prominent Niger Delta leader, Chief Julius Babogha has blamed President Buhari and some northern political leaders over the growing insecurity across Nigeria. He noted that Buhari\u2019s administration has failed Nigerians abysmally. He, therefore, called for the immediate resignation of the President, adding that he is no longer fit to solve the insecurity challenges facing the country.\n\nBabogha said: \u201cNigerians are tired and they can no longer put their hope in a leader they no longer have confidence in, because of his weakness to save lives and property of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNo president or leader will allow his people to pass through this agony and he is silent, without finding lasting solutions to the lingering problems, especially the insecurity across Nigeria. The security agencies and members of the National Assembly are not helping with the insecurity in the country that claims to be the giant of Africa. We cannot continue this way.\n\n\u201cUntil President Buhari, other political leaders and the security chiefs rise up to their responsibilities, Nigeria will remain a laughing stock across the globe.\u201d\n\nKidnapping in Cross River:\n\nCross River State facing serious security challenges, especially kidnapping, cultism, communal clash, militancy and armed robbery. When the situation became alarming, owners of businesses, including vehicle and electronics spare parts\u2019 dealers, timber market and a host of others in Calabar, the state capital, had to recently close their shops for two days, to protest the insecurity, thereby prompting Governor. Ben Ayade\u2019s administration to take quick action, particularly by inaugurating, in November 2020, a joint security task force, codenamed Operation Akpakwu.\n\nBut, high-profile kidnappings are still being recorded in the state. For instance, on March 21, 2021, the state\u2019s chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ben Ukpekpi was kidnapped at his residence. Forty-three days counting, as at May 1, he was still in captivity. A former Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, Chief Dominic Aqua Edem was also kidnapped in his farm at Bakassi in March 2021. But, he was released after a week and some days.\n\nMedical doctors had to embark on massive protest and strike to demand the release of their colleagues that were kidnapped at different timese.\n\nBesides kidnapping, unidentified gunmen have attacked policemen at checkpoints in Cross River State. Six policemen were killed in two separate attacks. Four of the security operatives were gruesomely murdered at a rural road leading to Akpabuyo LGA, while the two others lost their lives at the Obubra axis of the Calabar-Ikom federal highway.\n\nFootprints of IPOB:\n\nIn the last three months, no fewer than nine police officers have been killed and their vehicles burnt at security checkpoints by unknown gunmen in Essien Udim, Ika and Ikono LGAs of Akwa Ibom State. The perpetrators of the heinous attacks are suspected to be members of the proscribed IPOB or the Eastern Security Network (ESN), while there are unconfirmed reports that the assailants hoisted their flags at some locations in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe sudden rise in criminal activities in Akwa Ibom have raised serious security concerns, not just in the state, but also in the Southsouth, thereby heightening fears that the situation in the zone would further degenerate. Arising from the senseless attacks, experts, including former military and police officers have been analysing the security situation, with a view to proffering solutions.\n\nA former Military Administrator of Ogun and Rivers states, Group Captain Sam Ewang (rtd.) and a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (IGP), Udom Ekpoudom believe that marginalisation, youth unemployment and lack of equal access to benefits from crude oil resources, among others, are the major drivers of insecurity in the Southsouth zone.\n\nIn fact, they surmised that the nature and complexion of security challenges in the region is quite different from other zones, where banditry, kidnapping and terrorism have taken firm root, without any known solution.\n\nThey said marginalisation and deprivation of some sections of the country, particularly the Southsouth and Southeast zones, which feel they have been cheated in terms of appointments, control of resources and political power can be blamed for the growing unrest and civil disorder.\n\nEkpoudom said the insecurity in the region could be viewed from the deliberate neglect by successive administrations to do the right things by ensuring that every part of the country is treated fairly, without recourse to ethnic and religious considerations. He said: \u201dIPOB wants to secede. The Federal Government should treat all Nigerians equally. The administration of President Buhari should not select some parts of the country and give them juicy appointments, while relegating the others.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government must provide better equipment, arms and ammunition for the police and other security agencies, in order to enable them to fight crime. There is also the need for improvement in the welfare of the police, in terms of salaries and allowances. The police force and other security agencies have to be properly equipped to be able to fight criminal elements. The police and the military are not well equipped. It is unfortunate that criminals have more sophisticated arms than the police.\u201d\n\nEwang was equally of the opinion that the root of the security challenge in the Southsouth was purely economic, insisting that if poverty and unemployment were frontally tackled, the zone would be much safer for human habitation and investments that would enhance economic prosperity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe governors of the Southsouth zone must be willing to be committed to solving the problems of their people, without concentrating on themselves, their families and their political parties, because political parties\u2019 activities end, once winners emerge after the elections. The Southsouth also needs a security outfit such as \u2018Amotekun\u2019 in the Southwest and \u2018Ebube Agu\u2018 in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cGovernors of the six states should invite former police and military chiefs from the zone to a meeting, where the security situation in the Southsouth would be discussed and solutions proffered. As far as I am concerned, even though much of the Southsouth is water, we do not have to depend on the security apparatus of the nation. What I expected before now was that the governors would have come together to think of security in the zone.\u201d\n\nThe former military administrator also said he would rather recommend a comprehensive security structure for the Southsouth, since other zones were doing, which he maintained would be the best in the circumstance. He said: \u201dThe problem is that are we ready to sink our differences and look at our common threat? It is not that you are going to infiltrate anybody\u2019s territory. We need a synergy on intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a body that looks at security. That is why I am saying that we must have a security outfit, not necessarily to have a fighting force, but the one that will gather intelligence and help in planning. The security outfit can interface between the police and the civil populace, so as to find out why there are frequent frictions between them and will resolve whatever problems there are.\u201d\n\nEwang also urged the governors and security agencies based in the Southsouth to be proactive, rather than being reactive, so as to ensure the protection of lives and property of the residents of the zone.\n\nRegional collaboration:\n\nAn intelligence specialist and counter-terrorism expert, Prince Philip Diete-Spiff, advocated collaboration between the Southsouth governors, on the use of intelligence and technology to address the security challenges facing the zone. He said the component states of the Southsouth needed to sit together and look at the challenges in-depth, thereby seeing how each of the challenges affect each state singularly and collectively, in order to proffer timely solutions to them.\n\nDiete-Spiff said the security challenges facing the region were numerous, interconnected and multifaceted, hence the states must work in synergy to tackle the menace head-on. The counter-terrorism expert contended that if the Southsouth governors were able to tackle particular crimes plaguing the zone, especially cultism, sea piracy, kidnapping and armed robbery, among others, there would be ripple effects on other security challenges faced by the zone.\n\nHe also advocated the need for police authorities to come up with proper strategies to be able to address crimes in the zone, stating that one of the major challenges confronting the police was the use of reactive approach, called the traditional policing model. He said: \u201cThe policing agencies want something to happen first before they will react. This approach makes them look like a lame duck. This is 21st century, the policing agencies need to adopt a proactive approach. The proactive approach is anchored on the use of intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe policing agencies also need to employ community-oriented policing or problem-oriented policing. If you are able to first identify the problems that you are facing, imminent or eminent, it will help you to allocate proper resources to tackle the challenges that you are confronted with.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the policing agencies lack strategic planning. There are many factors responsible for crimes and when you are able to identify them, you will be able to properly address them, one after another. Some of them may be mutually exclusive, others are interconnected.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence specialist also rationalised that there was a point of consensus nowadays that criminals were being equipped with sophisticated weapons, sometimes more than what security operatives could have. He added that in situations where the criminals\u2019 weapons were better than what the policing agencies had, the battles would be lost. He likened the scenario to bringing a knife to a gun battle.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe authorities need to regularly review their strategies. We are a nation and we should be able to be the one with the most advantage over the criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe technology aspect of policing is missing in Nigeria. There are many things that technology can do for the Southsouth zone and by extension the country. The Nigeria Police are still backward in technology. It is imperative to employ technology, in order to tackle the security challenges we have.\u201d\n\nThe security expert also admonished Southsouth governors to do an in-depth study of what the problems are for each state and then collectively quickly agree on how to fashion out ways to address the insecurity in the strategic zone. He said: \u201cOnce the Southsouth governors have the in-depth study, it will be the first step to review the situation of things and based on that, they can come up with active measures to tackle the challenges.\n\n\u201cJust like what is happening in Nigeria, there is a high rate of organised crime in the Southsouth. It is very unfortunate that we have not been able to tackle that seriously. Organised crime has taken over a lot of countries and businesses.\n\n\u201cIf you look at one particular issue, for instance, the proliferation of arms, you might look at it in isolation. If a group of people are importing these arms, when they import them, there are people who will go and procure the arms and use them for armed robbery and other crimes.\n\n\u201cThe people using arms for crimes constitute one problem, which is the issue of armed robbery. Those who will go and buy the arms for insurgency are also there on the other hand. You have all sorts of things associated with that. By the time you look at just the proliferation of arms, you will find that it links to different other crimes and other security challenges.\n\n\u201cOne of our major challenges in the Southsouth is the issue cultism. It has become a norm in the zone. Now, you have a situation where primary school pupils belong to cults. The same issue of cultism is linked to political thuggery, drug addiction, robberies and other crimes.\u201d\n\nDiete-Spiff also stated that there must be conscious efforts on the part of the Southsouth governors and other stakeholders to tackle insecurity in the strategic crude oil and gas-rich zone. He said: \u201cIn order to put an end to insecurity in the Southsouth zone and other parts of Nigeria, emphasis must be placed on the provision of employment opportunities for the teeming qualified youths, addressing poverty, putting community policing in place and strengthening intelligence gathering, in order to attract investors and investments, thereby paving the way to the development of the country and empowerment of the people, so as not to repeat the civil war of 1967 to 1970.\u201d\n\nProvision of adequate security in the Southsouth zone and other parts of Nigeria should not be left for the government, as the people also have vital roles to play, in order to make Nigeria a much greater nation, in view of its potential, with the residents to be at peace and to always sleep with their eyes closed.",

          "title": "Southsouth, separatist agitation and national security",
          "text": "By Raymond Mordi, Deputy Political Editor\n\nThe escalating security situation in the Southeast appears to have cast its long shadow on the security situation in the Southsouth, given the historical and cultural links between the two geo-political zones. Four of the six states in the Southsouth were part of the defunct Eastern Region until May 5, 1967, when former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon carved out 12 states from the then four regions, as part of the strategy to counter the rebellion by the then administrator of the Eastern Region, Lt-Col. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu.\n\nToday, similar separatist unrest in the Southeast has made the region the country\u2019s latest zone of insecurity. The resurgence of the separatist bid stems from a perception that the region is marginalised under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari; particularly the perceived heavy-handed policing by security forces that have resulted in the death of hundreds of people since the emergence of the administration in 2015.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which was banned as a terrorist organisation in 2017, capitalised on the rising farmers-herders crisis and the grievance of the populace against the northern dominated security forces to form the Eastern Security Network (ESN) last December. It justifies the emergence of the ESN by stating that it was established to drive out pastoralists from the Southeast. The herders traditionally migrate to the southern part of the country with their cattle each year during the dry season. But, in recent times, the presence of the pastoralists who are usually armed nowadays has brought discord in its wake because they are perceived as part of the \u201cFulanisation agenda\u201d of the present administration. The idea of the Fulanisation agenda is not limited to the Southeast; it is prevalent in the North-central and all the geo-political zones in the South.\n\nRead Also IPOB not behind attacks in Southeast, says Abaribe\n\nThe deadly attack penultimate Sunday against security operatives at checkpoints along the ever-busy Port Harcourt-Owerri Road, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State suggests that the coordinated onslaught against security forces in the Southeast is spilling over to the Southsouth. Eight security officials, including two police officers were said to have been killed during the attack in Rivers State. The killings have prompted Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike to ban people from entering or leaving the state at night.\n\nHis Akwa Ibom State counterpart, Governor Udom Emmanuel has also announced a ban on the use of motorcycles l from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily. A motorcycle is one of the commonest means of transportation in the oil-rich state, especially in rural areas. The government\u2019s decision appeared to have been prompted by the continuous attacks on security agencies in the state, with the latest being the killing of two police officers last Saturday during an attack on a police facility in Ikono Local Government Area.\n\nIn the last three months, no fewer than nine police officers have been killed and their vehicles burnt at security checkpoints by unknown gunmen in Essien Udim, Ika and Ikono local government areas. The perpetrators of the heinous attacks are suspected to be members of the proscribed IPOB, using its militia group, the ESN.\n\nPoor policing is one of the factors aggravating the insecurity in the country at the moment. The ratio of policemen to the civilian population is well below what is required to maintain peace, going by the United Nations\u2019 recommendations. There is also the lack of equipment, poor training, and the low morale of the average officer. In recent times, the Federal Government has been drafting the army to assist in maintaining security. But the military does not also have the number of men to cope with such increasing demands. Besides, military men are not trained for purposes of policing the country; they are trained to kill and do not have the temperament to deal with civilians.\n\nRead Also: IPOB denies importing explosives into Imo\n\nBefore the advent of the current spate of attacks, the Southsouth has been battling with its peculiar security challenges, such as sea piracy, pipeline vandalism, kidnapping, armed robbery, cultism, smuggling and pockets of other violent crimes common to littoral states. With the rate of unemployment and the sheer amount of ungoverned space in the region, insecurity is a thriving business.\n\nThere is widespread poverty in the Southsouth, even though the region constitutes the milking cow of the federation. The Southsouth economy is not growing as it should because of the level of crime and instability in the region. Rivers, Bayelsa and Delta particularly were very notorious for militancy and youth restiveness in the heydays of the Niger Delta crisis.\n\nThe enabling environment to attract investment and create jobs for the people are lacking in most of the states. Many businesses that would have naturally been located there because of the proximity to raw materials are being moved to safer locations like Lagos. For instance, 650,000 barrels per day (BPD) Dangote integrated refinery and petrochemical project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, in Lagos State, was to be located at Onne in Eleme Local Government Area of Rivers State. But, owing to the volatile nature of the region, the project was later cancelled and relocated to Lagos, a more secure environment for the project.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNiger Delta people, especially the youths, are still agitating for commensurate infrastructural development and empowerment of the people, despite the continued implementation of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) for the repentant Niger Delta militants. The Federal Government\u2019s interventionist agency, the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs have almost become a drain pipe for politically exposed persons to siphon the resources of the people. Besides, all oil-producing states are receiving 13 per cent derivation from the oil revenue generated in their domains. Nevertheless, Niger Delta people continue to be subjected to poverty and unemployment, as well as inequality and marginalisation.\n\nNeglect and insensitivity is at the heart of the problems of the Southsouth states, which are the main oil-producing states in the country. The governors of the region have not done much to empower the youths, by raising the level of human capital development in different fields. The revenue generated from crude oil sales ought to have been used to develop other sources of wealth and raise the quality of lives of the people. Like elsewhere in the country, the ruling class continues to rely solely on the idea of using monthly allocations from the Federation Account to run their states. The manner the federation generates and distributes resources encourages docility among the political class.",

          "text": "By Elijah Udofia\n\nSIR: Good road network contributes to economic development and growth which bring important social benefits to the people. Road infrastructure is one of the most important of all public assets because apart from easing the movement of people from one place to another, it also help in moving raw materials to factories and goods from point of production to the final consumers.\n\nDespite its essentiality, good road network has continued to remain a mirage in Nigeria. From Sokoto to Calabar, Maiduguri to Lagos, a major complaint of Nigerians is bad roads. The deplorable conditions of roads in the country have made an hour journey to last for four hours or more. Nowadays, apart from praying not to fall victim to kidnappers and other criminals, Nigerians spend a lot of time praying against accidents as a result of bad roads.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor the people living or engaging in business activities in and around Ota, Atan, Igbesa, Lusada, Agbara and its environs, the deplorable condition of the road that links Atan to Agbara, has been a source of worry to them for a very long time, Apart from losing valuable human lives as a result of incessant accidents, the sorry state of the road also caused them to lose properties and valuable time. Some companies even closed shop in the axis due to the fact that the bad condition of the road added to their cost of production.\n\nKnowing the significant role that axis play in making Ogun State an industrial destination of choice in Nigeria and the fact that this axis provides the federal and Ogun State governments huge Internally Generated Revenue b(IGR), the Ogun State government under Prince Dapo Abiodun, decided to do what the previous governments in the state and even the federal government could not do by putting an end to many years of hardship and misery of those plying the road on daily basis.\n\nApril 29 would remain indelible in the minds of the people of these areas. It was the day Governor Abiodun turned the sod, signalling the commencement of the reconstruction of the 19Km Atan-Lusada-Atan road.\n\nThe question any right thinking person could ask at this point in time is \u2013 how can the goose that lay the golden egg be abandoned for so long? The deplorable condition of the road is so that anyone who is visiting the Atan, Lusada-Agbara road for the first time, would think that the areas had been at war and the sorry state of the road is one of the consequences of the war.\n\nThe award of contract for the reconstruction of this road is an indication that the Prince Abiodun is keeping to his word not to focus on developing one section of the State to the detriment of the other.\n\nOne is happy that succour has finally come to the people and the 19km road scheduled to be completed in 19 months, would bring back smile on the faces of the people and the economic activities in this axis would come back in full swing very soon.\n\nElijah Udofia\n\nLaderin Estate, Abeokuta, Ogun State.",

          "title": "\u2018If you want a healthy baby, men, feed your wife well\u2019",
          "text": "By Tijani Salami\n\nAbout three years ago I met a young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Auta, with their first baby. The little girl was one month old but weighed less than two kilograms. As a doctor, I wanted to understand why the baby was so underweight, and asked the couple a lot of questions. The only thing I could pinpoint was the mother\u2019s diet.\n\nThe typical Nigerian diet, especially in poorer rural areas, is mainly made up of carbohydrates such as cassava, yam and grains. These are high in energy but lack the protein that pregnant women require. A blood test confirmed that Mrs. Auta was anaemic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI see the impact of nutritional anaemia on women all the time, especially in rural areas. Anaemia doubles the risk of death in pregnancy and is a key reason why Nigeria has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. It predisposes women and their babies to serious risks including weakness, weight loss, pain, foetal growth retardation, fetal deaths, preterm-births and low birth weight. Anaemia also makes it more likely that mothers may need blood transfusions during or after childbirth, but this is not often available in rural areas, further raising the risk of death.\n\nSocial attitudes and habits are important in all aspects of pregnancy, and in a male dominated society like ours, this means more men need to play their part. At present there is no educational campaign that targets men on how to support their wives in pregnancy. And in patriarchal societies, preference is often given to feeding men, even when a woman is pregnant. This needs to change.\n\nAs part of my work with the Auta family, we went together to the market. Neither Mrs. Auta nor her husband had ever been told about what to eat during pregnancy and they thought that what they usually ate was sufficient. I showed them a range of foods that are widely available and rich in protein such as fish, meat, eggs and beans, and also encouraged them to eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits containing important vitamins and minerals. I am pleased to report that their baby improved rapidly once Mrs. Auta changed her diet. She is now pregnant with her second child and showing no signs of anaemia.\n\nNationally, Nigeria has made no progress on maternal anaemia since 1996. The condition affects 58% of pregnant women, driven largely by (to be replaced by lack of education) gender inequality and lack of access to health care services. Food fortification, which made such a difference to iodine deficiencies in the 1980s, has made no difference to maternal anaemia.\n\nUnfortunately, many patients I treat are either unaware of the importance of nutrition during pregnancy or cannot afford the foods that they need. In many of the areas where we work, significant numbers of women do not attend ante-natal services. It is not that they aren\u2019t aware of the service, but the clinic is often far from their homes. Even where ante-natal services and clinics exist, nutritional education is rarely available.\n\nThrough the organization, Sisters Caregivers, based in Niger State, we have been intervening at individual, family and community levels to raise awareness of the importance of maternal nutrition. Recently we have been working in Tawyi, a community in the Bosso Local Government Area. We have been holding public meetings with husbands and wives, educating them on the combinations of foods to eat, providing iron and folic acid supplements and discussing the signs of anaemia and the implications of severe anaemia\u2014including the possibility of an expensive blood transfusion. (Exactly what I wanted to say) The women we work with also compose songs in the local language with clear messages for men on the dangers of maternal malnutrition: \u201cIf you want a healthy baby, men, feed your wife well.\u201d\n\nOver a year we have found that this program has improved the quality of the mothers\u2019 diets, with fewer cases of anaemia. The supplements help, but when husbands are involved and understand the risks of malnutrition in pregnant women, it changes the game!\n\nI believe that, with government support, we can improve public education on maternal nutrition across the country, by targeting men as well as women. We also need to provide pregnant women with iron and folic acid supplements and create many more mobile midwifery clinics that include nutrition programs. We also need to better target food marketing to pregnant women.\n\nBut the most important component is information. Everyone needs to learn about the importance of a good diet during pregnancy and what foods a woman should eat. Husbands in particular need to put their wives\u2019 dietary needs first, especially when they are expecting.",

The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Presidency emphasised that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999, adding that the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences\u201d.\n\nIt also accused external forces of collaborating with the mischievous individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such move.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country.

          "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State. This influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat; our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the government had taken steps to ensure that the threat did not turn into an attack, adding that \u201cprofiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs, will be done in order to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nThe SSG assured the people that the state government would ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies would be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\nHe added that the people were not camped in a particular area but moving around the four LGAs and were harboured by residents of the communities, saying that security agencies would fish them out.\n\nThe government also said that five of the bandits who reportedly destroyed the MTN mast in Gamawa LGA in their bid to facilitate their nefarious activities had been arrested.\n\n\u201cSome bandits have been arrested for vandalising the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for an attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Security Council Reconvenes Today\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe council, which had met last Friday, could not conclude deliberations on the security position of the nation and had to adjourn till today to come with a holistic position on the security crisis.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting will hold at the Conference Hall of the First Lady by 10 am with Buhari presiding as usual.\n\nThose expected to attend the meeting include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\n\nOthers are: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Ishiaka Oladayo Amoo and the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Suspected herdsmen kill 17 in Benue\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nBandits who abducted some students of Greenfield University in Kaduna have threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom is not met by today.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by today, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nThis is coming as no fewer than 17 villagers were feared killed in a fresh attack by suspected herdsmen in Benue State.\n\nThe Kaduna students, numbering about 22, were abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm.\n\nThey were said to have demanded N800 million ransom for the release of the students.\n\nHowever, while negotiations were still ongoing, five of the students were killed.\n\nJalingo said 17 students, comprising 15 girls and two boys, were in his custody, including the grandson of the late Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris, whose name was given as Hamza.\n\nHe stated that the families of the abducted students had already paid N55 million, but they had spent the money to feed the students.\n\n\u201cYou are speaking with the abductors of Greenfield students. We heard the comments of the Kaduna State governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms.\n\n\u201cIf they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students,\u201d Jalingo was quoted as saying in the interview.\n\nHe said five of the abducted students were killed to prove that the state and the federal governments had failed.\n\nJalingo described himself as a \u201cfood seeker,\u201d when asked if he is a terrorist.\n\nHe also warned security agencies against planting trackers on the motorcycles, as his members don\u2019t go to towns, stressing that arresting them would be difficult.\n\nOne of the abducted students, Abigail Usman, also spoke during the telephone interview, calling on the government and parents to pay the ransom \u201cso that they will not kill us.\u201d\n\nKaduna State police spokesman, Mr. Mohammed Jalinge; and the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan did not respond to inquiries when contacted.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the university authorities were unsuccessful as the mobile phone of the registrar, Mr. Bashir Mohammed, was switched off.\n\nSuspected Herdsmen Kill 17 People in Benue\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 17 people were feared killed yesterday by suspected herdsmen in Tse Angbeghe Udam Aondoana and Agbanu Seghev/Ukuse in Gwer West Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Felicia Anor, who survived the attack, the herdsmen came through Akpachi in Otukpo Local Government Area and launched the attack on Tse Angbeghe, killing 15 people while 26 others sustained injuries.\n\nThe attackers also blocked the Naka Nagi Agagbe road killing two people on a motorcycle while four others were injured.\n\nThe attack prompted a peaceful protest in Naka town by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Gwer West Chapter.\n\nA pastor in the area, Mr. Sule Sunday, on behalf of the Christian community, expressed sadness over the persistent attack on the communities.\n\nHe called on the government to intervene. A resident pastor in the area, Rev.

The philanthropist took to his official Twitter handle to make the announcement on Monday.\n\n\u201cAfter a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,\u201d read a statement signed by him and his wife.\n\nGates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It went on to become the world\u2019s largest personal computer software company. Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.\n\nHe married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994. Their union produced three children: Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe which Gates acknowledged in his tweet.\n\nThe couple created the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 by combining three family foundations. The Foundation was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world\u2019s wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.\n\nThe statement added that the Foundation which works all over the world has \u201cenabled people to lead healthy, productive lives.\u201d\n\nGates noted that they would continue to work together at the Foundation but \u201cwe no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives\u201d\n\nThe couple is the latest power couple to end their marriage. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, ended his marriage to his wife MacKenzie in 2019.\n\nSee tweet link\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1389316412259270657?s=08\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A cross-section of Nigerians has expressed divergent views in reaction to the Lagos State government\u2019s recommendation of the prosecution of Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James, known as \u2018Baba Ijesha\u2019, under five provisions of Criminal Laws of the state.\n\nWhile some agreed with the possibility of life imprisonment, many argued that terrorists and murderers should get life imprisonment \u2013 not Baba Ijesha.\n\nThe police had in April arrested Baba Ijesha for sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Moyosore Onigbanjo, Lagos state Attorney-General said Baba Ijesha would be charged under the Criminal Law of Lagos State.\n\nOne of the charges is for Indecent Treatment of a child, which is punishable by seven years imprisonment. Another is Defilement of a Child, which is punishable by life imprisonment.\n\nSexual Assault by Penetration is also punishable by life imprisonment. Baba Ijesha is also being charged for Attempted Sexual Assault by Penetration, punishable by 14 years imprisonment, and Sexual Assault, which is punishable by three years imprisonment.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWhilst the state would ensure that Mr. Olanrewaju James\u2019s rights as enshrined in the Constitution are upheld, the Ministry of Justice would not relent in its efforts in ensuring that whoever sexually abuses any resident of Lagos State is speedily brought to book.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the Lagos State Ministry of Justice has been consistent in its efforts in protecting the vulnerable in our society and since the establishment of the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team in 2014, it has till date prosecuted over 800 cases of Sexual and Domestic offenses.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General hereby assures Lagosians and indeed Nigerians that in accordance with the DPP\u2019s advice, charges would be filed accordingly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians on Twitter expressed divergent views.\n\n@asonye_stephen said, \u201cHe can't get a life for that. May be a long jail term but obviously not lifetime imprisonment.\u201d\n\n@Agadax asked, \u201cWhat of the judge who is going to pass the judgement, how many years imprisonment is he going to get, or some of our politicians how many of them get imprisonment?\u201d\n\n@Kondix tweeted, \u201cWith the public prosecution and lapses, a smart lawyer will get him off. Don't count your chickens before.... I AM NOT IN SUPPORT OF ANY FORM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. But let the law take its course.\u201d\n\n@whizTido said, \u201cSanwo-Olu should be charged life imprisonment instead of Baba ijesha for the genocide he committed on peaceful protesters at Lekki toll gate.\u201d\n\n@shinawilliams2 said, \u201cWetin happen now? He no kill person now, sending him to jail is fine, not life imprisonment.\u201d\n\n@doyeayanniyine1 said, \u201cIf Baba Ijesa is found guilty of this offence and he is giving life imprisonment, what of those terrorists who kill innocent people?\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fifth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database.

          "title": "Microtraction\u2019s novel approach to early-stage investments in Africa is paying off",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on conversations with investors in Africa \u2013 investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, private equities, venture capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nYele Bademosi didn\u2019t start out in the tech space. Being born to parents in the medical field, he attempted to toe that same line. When he gained admission to study medicine at King\u2019s College London, it seemed like his path had been charted, until a few years later when he dropped out. Medicine just wasn\u2019t his passion.\n\nAfter leaving medical school, he launched his first startup in the UK \u2013 Purple, a social app that let university students with shared interests in the UK find and connect with each other. After efforts to scale the social media app proved abortive, he shut down the project and flew back to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, he got a job as a general manager of Starta \u2013 an online community and resource platform for African startup entrepreneurs. He helped Starta reach over 24,000 subscribers in eight months before it was acquired in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, after developing a taste for helping startups get off the ground, he founded Microtraction, an early-stage venture capital fund that has gone on to invest in over 15 startups.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed Director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of crypto platform, Binance. He was charged with developing Africa\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. He held this role until April 2020.\n\nIn August 2019, he founded Bundle, a social payments app for cash and cryptocurrency.\n\nOur conversation began with trying to understand what spurred Badamosi to hop on the venture capital train earlier than most people.\n\nYele Bademosi: I think the ecosystem is a lot different today than it was five years ago when I initially began thinking about the idea for Microtraction (MT).\n\nFor context, I spent about nine months working with Dotun, who is also a VC at Novastar. One of the things that we were doing was trying to help entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses through knowledge and networks. I realized from that experience that it was difficult for founders to raise money.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t really have any other avenue if they didn\u2019t have a network or a rich relative. That was what really drove this idea. How do we create an easier way for founders to raise money?\n\nAnother thing was the incubation model, which was also popular in Nigeria at the time, wasn\u2019t really a good fit for the market. We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\n\nI wanted to find an alternative means to invest and support entrepreneurs. This birthed the MT model. This idea of an open application for funding with fixed check sizes without a program or a demo day was something that was unique at the time and MT was the first vehicle to do something like that.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What did Micro traction think was missing?\n\nYB: For us, it was more about streamlining. People went into a physical space with a batch of other companies and at the end, there was a demo day. That was the norm \u2013 the YC model. Interestingly, we raised capital from a bunch of limited partners, including Michael Siebel (YC\u2019s CEO).\n\nWe didn\u2019t do programs because we felt that the materials that were being taught weren\u2019t entirely applicable to Nigeria and Africa at large. We also felt that that drove up the costs of running this program. You would spend anything from 60-80% on programs and only deploy maybe 20%. So from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\n\nThe second critical part was the batch model. You can\u2019t predict the timeline of the creation of quality companies. We felt that when you invest in batches, you end up investing in companies that may not be ready to take on external capital yet, or might not be venture backable. What we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\n\nThe third thing was this idea of demo days. I\u2019ve been to a number of demo days. Some of them were very well prepared, presented, and executed, but when you looked at the amount of funding that was picked up by these companies, it was quite low.\n\nWe prefer investor intros, building networks of investors, connecting our founders to investors who will invest in them.\n\nSo those three things: No batches, no programs, no demo days. That\u2019s what made the MT model unique.\n\nThe Microtraction Team\n\nDA: Interesting, I always thought MT was like YC. So what does your support look like?\n\nYB: It varies, there are a bunch of partners now at MT. My strength really is in product and business strategy. Chidinma, one of our partners, is very strong at financial operations for business and governance. Dayo is an ex-founder, he is able to provide first-hand experience of getting a business off the ground and what not to do or do. Ife is probably one of the best recruiters in the world. Antonia is our communications chief. Each person brings a unique set of skills that can help our companies.\n\nI think one thing we always tell founders, and I believe now more than ever especially since I\u2019ve started a startup is that a founder is what makes a company successful. We actually believe that our job is not to make \u2018okay\u2019 founders good, but to find great founders and cut the red tape or barriers that hinder them from building great companies.\n\nWe have a ton of various individuals and companies that are able to help our companies across hiring, fundraising, talent, business strategy, growth, regulatory and PR. A rolodex that you can go to get support and grow your company is very key. Now as the number of portfolio companies continues to scale, we also have a network of founders who are working in complementary spaces and they can learn from each other and connect with each other and open up their networks to each other.\n\nDA: What does a day look like at MT?\n\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies. Obviously, we spend more time with companies we\u2019ve just invested in versus a company that has been in our portfolio for three years.\n\nWe are also very honest with ourselves. We are a pre-seed fund. Our biggest impact is when you\u2019re getting off the ground; just having a listening ear and being able to help you think through the decisions that you want to make as a business.\n\nAnd as founders/ex-founders there\u2019s a very high level of empathy. We spend maybe 20% of our time networking with other investors and other players in the space or non-investors just building your network because your network is your capital as an investor. That\u2019s how we help our companies recruit or raise the next round of capital. 20% or 25% is spent talking to companies in our pipeline. The last 55% is spent on our portfolio companies.\n\nMT Partners, Dayo koleowo and Chidinma Iwueke\n\nDA: MT has a bias to invest in startups with technical founders/co-founders, why?\n\nYB: I think that really comes from my own experience as a founder. When I started my first company right out of leaving medical school, I tried without a technical founder and it was incredibly difficult.\n\nI raised money and spent money on outsourcing. Actually, I think I was fortunate with the developer I got because he actually built the product, but it took a long time because it wasn\u2019t the only thing he was working on. And it cost a lot of money. When I needed to make changes, I didn\u2019t have the capital to make the changes and I was extremely slow. It took about six, seven months to get to market.\n\nWhile this was going on, I had a friend in the UK who we used to build stuff together. He was technical, I was a product designer. We would have an idea on Thursday, meetup on Friday or Saturday, by Sunday evening we built something and it was on Play Store and App Store. It really confirmed to me the importance of having people on the team who have some kind of technical skill, because at the end of the day what gives a startup a high valuation is growth and what gives you the leverage for growth is the fact that your business is either software-based or tech-enabled in some way.\n\nIf we give you money and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders. We\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\n\nDA: MT offers only $25,000 for 7% equity to every company, why?\n\nYB: Essentially, it is more around standardisation. If we had to negotiate every single deal that we were going into, then it would be quite challenging. We\u2019re having numerous conversations because every investment we make, we\u2019re talking to another five or six companies. That\u2019s even at the investment committee level, at the second or third phone call or team call it\u2019s another 20 companies for every single investment. We think it\u2019s fair for these companies with little or no revenue but we also review our deal structure from time to time.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your due diligence process like and what\u2019s the time frame?\n\nYB: We have a due diligence checklist, essentially a lot of which is more around governance. Governance because we invest early in these companies, we make sure that the company has the right documents and structure to make them investible. We literally spend a lot of time actually getting documents like incorporation, founder vesting agreements, also reference calls \u2013 just things that show the company has good governance.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the areas that I think we can actually improve upon, which is saying, how much should you and can you fund an early-stage company that has not been in existence for a very long time. There are some that are less than a week because the company is prepared or usually it takes weeks, it depends on how prepared the company is.\n\nDayo Koleowo at TechCabal\u2019s Edtech Townhall\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nYB: When I think of what will make me not invest in this company, the first thing is market opportunity. How big can this business be? Venture capital is extremely skewed. It\u2019s really about maximum upside as opposed to protecting your downside. What I mean by that is when we invest in companies we try to project the best possible outcome for the company.\n\nSo if the maximum upside is still looking like a small company, then we won\u2019t invest. That\u2019s probably why we say no to the vast majority of companies.\n\nNumber two is the progress made over time. I ask myself, am I impressed with how fast the company has moved within a particular time period? For a lot of companies, their progress over time isn\u2019t impressive especially when there are other companies to benchmark in that space.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the team. How good is the team? I don\u2019t do this as much anymore, but when I first started, I used to ask myself a question \u2018would I work for this founder?\u2019\n\nIf I had just moved back, starting off my career in the Nigerian or African tech ecosystem, and I saw this company, would I want to join them? Obviously, after five years, it\u2019s not the same so I can\u2019t really use that same benchmark because things are a lot different. But I still ask would I love to work for this founder? A lot of times when the answer is yes, the team is usually very strong.\n\nThe intersection of team, market and progress over time is what we look at. When a company fails those things, I\u2019m typically not interested in investing.\n\nDA: How has Covid-19 affected MT?\n\nYB: We actually continued investing during the pandemic. COVID had a bigger effect on startups than investors because investors have already collected money upfront. As an investor, you\u2019re not directly affected, it will affect your portfolio companies. I think COVID-19 impacted the quantity and quality of deal flow \u2013 the rate at which we receive investment offers.\n\nDA: Any exits from your end?\n\nYB: At MT, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to exit some of our positions, but we\u2019ve not taken those offers primarily because we still believe that there are significant opportunities for these companies to grow. The beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments. Most people when they hear exits they think about exits like the Paystack exit but the less popular/more common exit is usually a secondary exit where an investor exits or sells some of its shares to an existing investor or incoming investor. What we\u2019ll learn with this ecosystem is that exits are just a matter of time and we\u2019ll definitely see more exits in the future.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the tech space?\n\nYB: We\u2019re going to see a lot of investments going into fintech. I think we are going to see larger rounds coming into the industry. They\u2019ll stimulate a lot more stuff up in crypto, but they will move beyond the exchanges. I think crypto will probably be the second or at least in the top five sectors. Recently, I was looking at deals I did at Binance labs. I think from a fundraising perspective those deals probably outperformed any group of recent investments given the time that they took to raise over a million within a year to 18 months.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see some innovations in real money gaming, not just sports betting, but through playing games where you can win/ lose some money or some prizes.\n\nI think there\u2019ll be some moves in what I call export services, or export software services, which are essentially entrepreneurs that build products offered to global markets. I would definitely love to invest in anyone that is building anything around those ideas \u2013 crypto, gaming and export services.",

This announcement follows a discussion that took place in January between Nigeria\u2019s vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo and Microsoft\u2019s Corporation President, Brad Smith.\n\nThe collaboration is in line with Nigeria\u2019s economic sustainable plan to grow the economy. It will foster job opportunities and upskill up to five million people in Nigeria, creating over 27,000 new digital jobs in the next three years.\n\nIn a statement by Microsoft, they are setting a \u201cbig goal to bring access to digital skills to five million people in Nigeria over the next three years. But this is not something we can do by ourselves. We will equip master trainers and, along with them, are committed to creating thousands of new jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we have an enormous opportunity to put technology to work, create jobs, to foster the technology ecosystem across Nigeria, and to use technology to preserve the best of the past and take us into the future.\u201d\n\nAs seen on Microsoft\u2019s website, each of Nigeria\u2019s six geo-political zones will have access to high-speed internet infrastructure courtesy of the digital transformation plan.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Airband team will work closely with local partners to improve broadband connectivity in these communities while also assisting with the design and implementation of hyper-scale cloud services.\u201d\n\nOn their end, the Nigerian presidency believes that Microsoft\u2019s extensive experience with using technology as an enabler for public and social good makes them an ideal partner.\n\nThis collaboration will focus on three major areas of development. Connectivity, skilling and digital transformation. Microsoft says after extensive consultation with the Nigerian government, they identified these three areas as key pillars to building strong foundations for a digital economy in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft partnered with IT firm Tek Experts, to create a Customer Support Centre in Lagos. The centre, according to them, employs over 1,600 people. This new digital initiative is another opportunity the tech company has to broaden their investment even more in Nigeria.\n\nBrad Smith said in a tweet that the company believes in the future of Nigeria and that they are excited about this partnership.\n\nThe initiative will also help protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural heritage. Microsoft will deploy artificial intelligence tools to protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural treasures for generations to come. They will do this alongside the National Institute of Cultural Orientation to revive and preserve the country\u2019s three major indigenous languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.\n\n\u201cThis is one of my favourite projects that we pursue around the world.

          "text": "Texas, Lagos, and Mexico City; 29 April 2021: Platform Capital (\u201cPlatform\u201d), a leading growth markets investor, is pleased to announce it led a $1.3 million investment round into STRAP Technologies (\u201cSTRAP\u201d), an innovative company that has developed the world\u2019s first total technology replacement of the white cane for the blind & visually impaired.\n\nGlobally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindless, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden with the associated annual productivity losses estimated to be over $25.4 billion. The leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.\n\nSTRAP has developed a range of hardware and software solutions that address the mobility challenges that the blind and visually impaired encounter daily. After years of R&D and extensive testing, STRAP has integrated its solutions into a lightweight, chest-worn device that guides the blind and visually impaired by calculating the proximity of physical environments, allowing them to move unaided. This hands-free wearable harness uses haptic language to warn of hazards like an oncoming passer-by, walls, steps, and even changing elevations on sidewalks and other pathways. The company has received significant pre-orders from over 6,000 customers across North & Latin America and will ship its devices in Q4 2021. For a video overview of STRAP\u2019s technology in action, click here.\n\nThe company is also backed by International Accelerator and a group of Angel Investors. As part of Platform Capital\u2019s investment, Dr. Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Platform Capital, joins the Board of STRAP.\n\nDiego Roel, Founder and CEO of STRAP Technologies said \u201cSTRAP is the first assistive technology on the market that replaces the white cane that\u2019s been in use for over 100 years. I am inspired and excited by this recent investment and support in what STRAP is doing. The investment represents the belief in what we have accomplished and what we have been passionately working on these last three years in research and development. We appreciate the confidence of our investors in STRAP and strengthening our position for the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Ponmile Osibo, Partner at Platform Capital said \u201cWe are proud to partner with STRAP Technologies. Their innovative solution provides an exciting alternative for the white cane. We believe that this technology will impact millions of lives globally. We look forward to working with the STRAP team to scale and to ensure that visually impaired people can live dignified & independent lives without guides or the white cane.\u201d\n\nAbout STRAP Technologies\n\nSTRAP Technologies mission is to bring increased independence and autonomy to the visually impaired through the development of the world\u2019s first substitute for the white cane. Their featured product, STRAP, is a state-of-the-art wearable device that enables blind and visually impaired people to detect and respond to any type of obstacle and notify them of possible collisions.\n\nThe device is now available for pre-order with a limited promotional price of $500 USD.

          "text": "From FirstBank PR dept.\n\nIf you live in Lagos, Abuja or Port Harcourt, or you reside in any of the other state capitals, you probably take for granted that you actually live in the better of the two worlds that make up Nigeria when it comes to banking. Take Lagos, for example, you would find a bank in almost any corner you turn. You have many streets in business or commercial areas in the city that are lined up by nothing but banks in all their glory and magnificence. If a count is taken, it could be established that there are probably more bank branches in Lagos than any other branded business outlets or branded activity centres \u2013 if street stores and religious centres are excluded.\n\nMany people in city centres somehow assume that this situation of banks being in your face in cities is the same reality that prevails in most parts of the country. They have no idea that there are parts of Nigeria, especially the hinterland, where people take the absence of banks for granted the same way city dwellers take the preponderance of bank branches for granted. To get to the nearest bank, people in the hinterland who live this reality every day would have to travel many kilometres to get to their state capitals or some other large towns. These are the people living in the worse of the two worlds you find in Nigeria as far as having bank presence is concerned.\n\nImagine if the situation were reversed and city dwellers had to travel many kilometres to get to the nearest bank branch where they could do their transactions. It is not unlikely that such a situation would be accompanied by a ballooning of the stress levels in city dwellers, increased road rage on city highways and heightened frustration generally. How would people who spend multiple hours in traffic on a daily basis, work longer than counterparts elsewhere for far less remuneration, enjoy less sleep on their beds and less time with family and loved ones, cope with the additional burden of walking or driving endlessly in search of a bank to do their transactions? How? Just how?\n\nSo city dwellers should indeed be thankful for their world. And while at it, they as well as people in the hinterland, who live in the other world, should not be shy to extend appreciation to those working so hard and tirelessly to bridge the gap between the two worlds in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) financial inclusion initiative geared towards bringing the unbanked and underbanked as well as communities in Nigeria\u2019s hinterland into the formal financial ecosystem has been key to efforts to bridge the gap. The CBN\u2019s mandate to ensure the availability of affordable financial products and services to all individuals and groups of people in Nigeria, regardless of location, literacy level, familiarity with technology or accessibility to modern infrastructural facilities, has been wholly embraced, supported and promoted by FirstBank.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s unmatched commitment to financial inclusion is informed by the bank\u2019s undivided focus on making real impact across Nigeria. Hear Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, the Chief Executive Officer of the premier bank in West Africa and the leading financial inclusion services provider in Nigeria for over 127 years: \u201cThe key strength of our franchise is our ability to look at gaps in the society and develop products and services that [address those gaps].\u201d Continuing, he notes that as an integral part of the bank\u2019s strategy, \u201cWe believe that by significantly working with the Central Bank to improve the financial inclusion index of the country, we would, as FirstBank, be assisting [the] country to address poverty, to address hunger, thereby also promoting security of life and property because when people are gainfully employed, the implication is that they think less of crime.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that FirstBank has driven the financial inclusion initiative much more vigorously than any other bank in Nigeria, with its Firstmonie Agent channel, which crossed the 100,000 Agents mark a few days ago, being among the bank\u2019s many initiatives to expand financial access in the country. The 100,000 Agents feat in itself speaks volumes about the bank\u2019s strides in the financial inclusion space. No other bank comes anywhere close to FirstBank in terms of number and spread of agents in their agent banking networks. FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie Agents and the thousands of staff they employ are in all the 774 local government areas in Nigeria save two and, in 2020 alone, processed over 295 million transactions with a total value of N6.65 trillion and opened more than 196,000 accounts. However, for FirstBank, it is not about number or competition with others or even being the largest bank-led network in Africa, but the impact the Firstmonie Agents channel it is creating, as Dr Adeduntan highlighted above. His deputy, Francis Shobo agrees, saying FirstBank is looking beyond numbers and considering impact. He makes a bold declaration, \u201cWe are trying to make those Agents the centre of the financial ecosystem in the country.\u201d This probably explains why Firstmonie Agents are considered by the bank as community heroes that it is planting all over the nation. And this is the sense one gets in interviews with Agents and customers across the country.\n\nAiyetoro is a riverine community in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State. It has no banks, according to Stephen Adeleye, a Firstmonie Agent serving Aiyetoro community. He recounts how Firstmonie has impacted his community. Adeleye says Firstmonie has provided easy access to banking ensuring that \u201cpeople in the community now have this kind of savings habit\u201d \u2013 a reference to the growing savings culture in Aiyetoro. One of his customers, Tina Farodoye, who operates a grocery store in the community says Firstmonie has helped her business to grow. She can now buy her stock in bulk all the way from Lagos where they are relatively inexpensive (even with transport costs added) compared to her community, all because she is able to transfer funds through Agent Stephen to the wholesalers in Lagos. This has improved her business profitability by increasing the profit margin in her business.\n\nEphraim Osinachi, is a Firstmonie Agent in Obehie, Asa Ukwa West, Abia State. He serves customers across all ages, including the very aged, as all customers are assisted with their transactions, unlike the use of ATM where the customer is practically on their own. He says market traders take advantage of his presence in the community to make lodgements at the end of the day\u2019s trade. He and his staff wait until traders are done at the market (unlike your regular banks which shut their doors to customers at four o\u2019clock, generally). The advantage this offers the people is invaluable. He cites a case where a customer\u2019s house was raided by robbers in their absence and all the robbers could find after ransacking the entire house was fifty naira cash and old phones valued at N3,000. His services are enabling his community to avoid keeping bulk cash at home and the consequent risk of being robbed and traumatised by men of the underworld.\n\nOrode Hesse, Firstmonie Agent in Ubeji, Warri South, Delta State is both emphatic and ecstatic about impact Firstmonie has had on her life. She enthuses that it has really impacted and empowered her financially and enabled her to empower others, especially other women. She has six employees, five of whom are female. So she sees Firstmonie as a business or platform to employ and empower women. Interestingly, Orode is part of the 26 per cent of Firstmonie Agents that are women, a fact that points to the important role Firstmonie is playing in driving women economic empowerment.\n\nAbubakar Aki Bolaji, is a Firstmonie Agent along Karishi Road, Orozo in FCT, Abuja. He points out that the nearest bank to his community is 15km away. He is pleased that his presence as an Agent in the community has cut out the costs of transportation his people would have continued to incur in order to access banking services. His sentiment and delight are shared by the teeming customers he serves. This situation is very common in the North given its landmass and the dispersed nature of human settlements. Dr Adeduntan relates how a senior government official in Jigawa State highlighted how important the presence of Firstmonie Agents was when he informed him that all across a 70km stretch from Gumel, where there was the branch of a bank, there were no banks anywhere in sight. All he saw were at least two Firstmonie Agents in that long stretch of 70km, no banks. Without those two Agents, all the people in the settlements along that 70km stretch would be without access to banking services.\n\nAnother Firstmonie Agent, Mohammed Tatari, serving Tudun Wada in Bununu, Bauchi State, says his services are helping to drive commerce in his community as traders are now able to transfer funds to the wholesalers elsewhere from whom they buy. His services are helping traders to avoid carrying large cash with them given the dire security situation. He noted that the people used to travel elsewhere just to access banking service. His presence has changed all that now. He concludes that Firstmonie is changing his community (for good). One woman who would agree with him is Halima, a housewife and petty trader in the outskirts of Abuja. She discovered Firstmonie through her co-tenant, during the recent lockdown due to COVID-19, and was excited that she could access funds at the Firstmonie Agent outlet close to her and send money to her mother in far away, Maiduguri in Borno State. She had been unable to move to Garki where her bank branch was because of the lockdown.\n\nBesides ensuring that individuals in the suburbs do not have to travel for long hours to the city for their banking activities, Firstmonie Agents are also bridging the gap between the tech-savvy and the low-literacy clients as the Agent network represents the convenient and comfortable alternative for customers that are unacquainted with sophisticated digital channels. And as Firstmonie Agents give their best, FirstBank, on its part, has been doing everything to encourage the Agents. In its inaugural Firstmonie Agent Banking Awards, FirstBank rewarded 37 leading Agents that have promoted financial inclusion in the country. Thirty-one (31) Agents each won the sum of N250,000 at the state level while five Agents won the sum of N1,000,000 at the regional level. At the national level, the grand prize of N2,500,000 was won by Zayyanu Hassan Ishaq, an Agent from Abuja (North Central), who described it as a miracle and noted that it would spur him to work harder.\n\nAs further encouragement and to promote the business activities of Firstmonie Agents, the bank announced the provision of loan facilities of up to N1,000,000 to the Agents. This new credit scheme, which they can access 24 hours a day, can be processed in less than two minutes. The scheme means more empowerment and business expansion for Firstmonie Agents. And the expansion can go beyond Nigeria as Dr Adeduntan says FirstBank is looking beyond Nigeria to other African countries where FirstBank operates, like Ghana and DRC \u2013 a country with over 80 million people \u2013 to promote financial inclusion and begin to address poverty on the African continent through the Firstmonie platform.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun State Commissioner for Works and Transportation, Engr. Remi Omowaiye, has said the administration Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is more committed to infrastructural and human capital development in the state, just as he reiterated the administration\u2019s commitment to complete Olaiya Flyover within the stipulated nine months period.\n\nOmowaiye in the company of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Transportation, Engr Toke Olaniyan disclosed this on Monday while speaking with journalists after the inspection of the ongoing Olaiya flyover project.\n\nHe said the pace at which the project is going was highly encouraging, adding that all the necessary material needed have been on ground for the speedy completion of the project.\n\nOmowaiye who was highly elated over speed of the project, said despite the ongoing flyover project, all other road projects across the state are not being affected.\n\nIt would be recalled that Governor Oyetola on February 28, 2021, flagged off the construction of Olaiya flyover in Osogbo.\n\nThe N2.7 billion flyover, handled by Messrs Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited, is a 4-span of 15m each, with two Underpass bays for U-turning to Fakunle/Justrite and MDS/Post Office.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWe started this project three months ago, we are in the activity of the fourth month, which means we are going to finish this project under nine months. Work rate here is over 30 percent, which is an indication that we are moving faster than we envisaged.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we do not compromise standards, all regulatory bodies come here often and they see that we don\u2019t compromise standards.\n\n\u201cBefore we started this project, we carried out our environmental impact assessment to look at the impact of the closure of Olaiya on the immediate environment. We kept on reviewing the impact and I can tell you we are able to manage all the challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile we are waiting for piles to cast, we started doing drainage which supposed to be activities of week five but instead of us to wait we started to do drainages.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cWhat is important is not the percentage of construction but the fact that we are running the projects on the site simultaneously. Everything that is needed for the construction is on ground.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed the insinuation that the flyover project is the contractor\u2019s first major project, saying that besides being an indigenous contractor, he has also handled over 100 projects in known states of the country, including bridges.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the contractor handling the project has not done a major project before. It was not only the company that bided, we have two companies. The contractor has done projects in Akwa Ibom, he is doing two in Oyo State and he has done over 100 big contracts in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the contractor is an indigene of Osun, his corporate social responsibility is coming back to the State, besides, he can stand shoulder to shoulder with international contractors in terms of quality service delivery. He is a contractor we can vouch for, we have looked at his pedigree before we consider him.\n\n\u201cThe one he did in Akwa Ibom was done six to seven years ago which was constructed on the water. Our own here is even better, it is standing on a rock\u201d Omowaye added.\n\nSpeaking on the present administration\u2019s commitment to infrastructural development, Omowaiye noted that at the moment, not less than 10 township road projects are ongoing, adding that over 20 major township roads would be commissioned before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have not less than 10 township roads projects ongoing across the state. The flyover project is not even affecting other ongoing projects. Orioke Pure Water road project is ongoing, Lautech /Ajegunle road project, Ona baba Ona road. All these road projects are ongoing.\n\n\u201cKelebe /Iragbiji road almost completed and it\u2019s new road that we just opened up. Ido Osun township road, Kuta Township road, Ife township roads are ongoing. All the roads projects we inherited from the last administration. Iperindo/Ipetu-Ijesa road among others.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over 5 billion naira on the road projects inherited from the last administration. Akoda/Gbongan road, Ada Igbajo road which has reached 90% completion.\n\n\u201cAny moment from now, we are going to award Lawyer Atanda road in Iwo. Aleluya road, Lameco/Okinni/Icon/Ilobu road about 11 KLM road. Modakeke /Famia road has completed before we later approved another 1klm. In Ife north, Ipetu, Moro, Yakoyo road project already completed.\n\n\u201cIla-Orangun road about 10 KLM is undergoing procurement, as a matter of fact, over 20 major road projects will be completed and commissioned before the end of this year,\u201d Omowaiye said.",

Once a sport for Kings, it is still popular among people from different countries and regions. This sport is also a part of the Emirati culture and heritage.

          "text": "BY OUR CORRESPONDENT\n\nFor the business year ended December 31, 2020, construction giant, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, grew its total assets by 4.9% to N329 billion from N317 billion recorded in the previous year.\n\nDespite the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations, the company recorded a stable turnover of N 242 billion and a profit before tax of N3.9 billion.\n\nWith an operational cash-flow of +N6 billion, the company continued implementing strategic investments, amounting to N10 billion within the period.\n\nThe figures released by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicate that the company was able to overcome temporary shutdowns of its construction sites in the second quarter of 2020 by utilising its strong base of personnel and capital resources.\n\nGiven the industry-wide disruptive effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant operational quarantine and slowdown on businesses and supply chains as well as other interplaying scenarios all through the 2020 operating year, the company said it was commendable that it still resiliently sustained its well-rooted technical and administrative resourcefulness as well as its financial stability and well being.\n\nAccording to the statement by the managing director, Julius Berger Plc, Engr. Dr. Lars Richter, \u201cJulius Berger continues to maintain its historical and robust resilience to top the class and retained the driving seat of the engineering construction sector.\n\n\u201cLooking at the result from Julius Berger holistically, industry experts and analysts submit that the fact that the company worked in such a focused way to successfully improve on its turnover to maintain its leading edge in the construction sector despite the operational threats occassioned by the global pandemic, is a clear plus for the country\u2019s engineering construction leader.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cComparatively, financial institutions and network providers in the telecommunication sub-sector for example during the lockdown still very much enjoyed huge patronage via electronic operations and from providing remote essential services even at reduced overhead expenses.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the construction sector in general, only the fittest such as the operationally strong and healthy Julius Berger brand, sustained investor confidence and continued to thrive. The lockdown period heavily impacted on the construction sector\u2019s operations amidst restrictions as only small windows of operations opened.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore even more noteworthy that the company, according to industry insiders, opted to take seriously its sector leadership responsibilities, and did not sack any staff while the lockdown lasted.\n\n\u201cThe strong commitment to its workforce came in addition to the company\u2019s commitment to communities and Nigeria at large. The figures show the company implemented a dedicated CSR budget and spent N 0.5 billion to alleviate impacts from the covid-19 pandemic on Nigeria and its citizens.\u201d\n\nHe added that from the figures released, Julius Berger, having clearly beaten the odds against the pandemic and other evaluative indices, is set to compensate its investors with a dividend of 40 kobo per share plus a bonus.\n\nLEADERHIP reports that Julius Berger has been listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange since 1991 and engineering construction business is at the heart of the Julius Berger Group\u2019s enterprise.",

          "text": "May 3, 2021 552\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.",

          "text": "April 29, 2021 536\n\nPort users, commuters and other motorists are currently groaning over the worsening gridlock on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway and along the Marine Bridge, Ijora, as trailers and tanker drivers have taken over these routes despite the implementation of the electronic call-up system by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock. Under the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\n\nHowever, two months into the implementation of the new system, there seems to be no end in sight to the intractable gridlock with NPA and Lagos State Government appearing helpless as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately on the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some truck drivers, due to the alleged slow process in booking of trucks by the Truck Transit Park (TTP), the company managing the eto application, have abandoned the designated parks to remain on the roads and bridges where they bribe their way into the port with fake e-call up slip in connivance with security personnel deployed to manage the gridlock.\n\nThe action by these truck drivers, coupled with the poor access roads and ongoing construction along the Mile Two-Tin Can Island Port road, has compounded the gridlock as motorists spent several hours trying to get into Apapa yesterday.\n\nAll the major roads into Apapa were completely taken over by trucks and petroleum tankers yesterday. The traffic stretched to other major highways including Eko Bridge and Ikorodu Road.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Directs NSCDC To Collaborate With Other Agencies To Prevent Attacks At Airports\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Stanley Ezenga, said there has not been any respite on the road despite the e-call up system, which he said has become a money-making venture for some people benefiting from the situation.\n\nHe said the traffic situation persists due to poor access roads and the failure of the government to prevail on the contractor handling the construction of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to expedite action.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature. The e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it. For each call up, trucks pay N10,000 but this is just the official money. They still part with other money being given to security operatives before they get to the port.\n\n\u201cSo who is fooling who? From the onset, I know there will be issues with the e-call up because the main issue that has to do with the gridlock coupled with the state of the road has not been addressed. You can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Navy, created a task force but the gridlock has negated all of them. The e-call up is not working. That is why the gridlock is still there. It is the same road the trucks will pass when they are called and when they are not called upon and yet the issues that made them to be on the road have not been addressed.\u201d",

          "title": "The Nigerian Telecom Sector Can Breathe Again",
          "text": "April 29, 2021 427\n\nA week is a week. This is almost true in every part of the world regardless of the season. Every week is also unique. The activities, the happenings, and the stories define each week.\n\n*This week has been epoch-making in every sense. This week, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd. The verdict was unanimous. He was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for over 9mins. George in pleading for his life kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Philonise Floyd, George\u2019s brother said that he\u2019s \u201cable to breathe again\u201d.\n\nThe feeling of relief was widespread. It was a sigh of relief heard around the world. We can all breathe again.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government lifted the ban on sales of SIM cards.\n\nOfficially, it meant that the telcos could resume sales of SIM cards after months of suspension. The sector and indeed Nigerian telecom services consumers were able to breathe again.\n\nDuring the ban, countless people who had lost their phones or damaged their SIM cards couldn\u2019t retrieve them. Visitors to the country couldn\u2019t get SIMs and businesses that depended on SIM card sales suffered. Millions were thrown out of jobs, sales outlets shut down and operators lost revenue. The last five months were a real chokehold on the telecommunications industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Employment Statistics: World Bank, FG To Discuss Modalities Of Data Collection\n\nConservatives reports indicate that the number of connected lines dropped by over 10 million lines. Think, loss in revenue to the telecom services providers and endless pain for the customers who couldn\u2019t connect with family, friends, or business. It was a chokehold.\n\nNo wonder the sector couldn\u2019t breathe. Little wonder the economy recorded a rise in the number of unemployed and more citizens dropped into the poverty zone. The country couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nSince nature abhors a vacuum, it didn\u2019t take long for illegal sales of pre-registered SIMs to gain ground. This is a story for another week.\n\nThe biggest loss was that the objective was lost to all but the initiators. It was a chokehold on the economy, Nigerians couldn\u2019t breathe and nobody knew why.\n\nFirst, a little context. The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, had in December 2020 ordered the suspension of the sales and activation of new SIM cards across all phone networks in the country. Through the NCC, he directed Nigerians to ensure that their phone lines were connected to their National Identification Numbers (NIN) or risk losing the lines.\n\nNow, the suspension was expected, at the time, to last till the completion of the NIN registration. The date fixed was early January.\n\nExperts swore that it was an impossible mission. For in a decade, the NIMC registered less than 50 million people, how can the same organization be reasonably expected to sign on over 50 million people in under six weeks? The experts were right.\n\nSo, it was no surprise therefore that the deadlines had to be shifted repeatedly. The humongous crowd at the registration centres made Nigerians criticised the government for not making adequate provisions before the directive went into effect.\n\nBanning SIM sales precipitated what appears to be several unintended consequences. The number of internet subscribers dropped, no doubt, limiting the chance of meeting the NCC set broadband target.\n\nIn these days of reducing average revenue per user (ARPU), it is a case of declining revenue for the operators.\n\nWhile telcos can\u2019t be expected to complain openly, the impact was an open wound. It was visible for all to see.\n\nThe pain is equally real. Job loss. Revenue loss.\n\nAt a time, when the economy is witnessing diminishing revenues, these losses also mean a reduction in taxes payable to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the government\u2019s actions with its regulations. The situation is typical. The telecommunications industry is making massive contributions to the GDP, yet it was placed in a chokehold and left struggling to breathe.\n\nThankfully, this week, the sector can breathe again. Yes, Nigerians can breathe again.\n\nDarnella Frazier, the teenager whose viral video of George Floyd\u2019s murder helped the case, has been praised for her bravery. It would also be proper to laud all the analysts and writers who pushed tirelessly for the resumption of SIM sales in Nigeria.\n\nElvis Eromosele, a Corporate Communication professional and public affairs analyst lives in Lagos\n\n* Article was written a week prior publication.",
