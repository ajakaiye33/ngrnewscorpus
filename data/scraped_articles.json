          "text": "An Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi, on Tuesday urged government not to take the threat by the kidnappers of students of Greenfield University, Kaduna lightly.\n\nGumi, who stated this in an interview with The PUNCH, said the Central Bank of Nigeria should pay the N100m ransom being demanded by the kidnappers of the students.\n\nREAD ALSO: Senate asks Customs to return rice, cash seized in Ibadan markets\n\nHe made the call as a parent of one of the abductees lamented that the kidnappers were insisting on a ransom of N100m.\n\nThe parent, who spoke to one of our correspondents in Kaduna on condition of anonymity, lamented that the bandits were still insisting on their demands and threatening to kill the students.\n\nNo fewer than 23 students and a member of staff of the university were abducted from the school on April 20, 2021. Few days later, five of the students were killed by the bandits.\n\nOn Monday, one of the bandits, Sani Jalingo, in an interview with the Hausa service of the Voice of America, demanded N100m and 10 motorcycles for the students to be freed.\n\nHe threatened that the failure of the Kaduna State Government or families of the students to meet the demands by Tuesday (yesterday), would lead to the killing of the abductees.\n\nBandits not shifting ground, insist on N100m, 10 motorcycles \u2013 Parent cries out\n\nThe parent, who spoke to The PUNCH correspondent in Kaduna at 9pm on Tuesday, called on the Federal Government to do everything possible to rescue the students.\n\nHe also called on corporate organisations to assist in rescuing the students.\n\nHe said the call became imperative as the bandits stood their ground that unless their demands were met the remaining students would be killed.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bandits still stand their ground of demanding N100m and ten motorcycles; no individual negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the government to do whatever it can to see to the release of our children. Our children have stayed long in the forest.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the state of their health at the moment. We don\u2019t know whether they are being fed or how they are treated by the bandits.\n\n\u201cAll that we can say now is for the government of the day, especially, the Federal Government and well-meaning Nigerians to come to our aid. We can\u2019t afford the N100m and the motorcycles demanded by the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe are also calling on corporate organisations to come under their corporate social responsibilities to assist us to get our children out of the bandits\u2019 den.\u201d\n\nBoko Haram joining herdsmen involved in kidnappers \u2013 Gumi\n\nGumi, who spoke on Tuesday during a programme of the African Independent Television, Kakaaki, monitored by one of our correspondents, said he needed the support of the Federal Government to rescue the students.\n\nWhen asked if he was aware of the kidnap of the students of Greenfield University and the Federal College of Forestry, he said \u201cAs for the forestry students, we have been trying to see whether we can get some of the herdsmen\u2019s contact so that they can release these people.\n\n\u201cWe have also been trying our best but you know we have limitations, there are lots of obstacles on the way but the parents have been really consulting with us.\u201d\n\nOn the Greenfield University students, the cleric said, \u201cThe issue of the Greenfield students is a little bit more complex.\n\n\u201cThere are two groups of bandits. We have the ordinary Fulani ethnic herdsmen and the religious elements, terrorists. That is why we have been telling the government to support us so that we can go in and bring the children out.\n\n\u201cThe issue is getting compounded because this element is coming in; Boko Haram is coming into the scene now. They are the ones that captured Greenfield students. It is not a question of sleeping. You have to act very fast.\u201d\n\nGumi asks FG to pay the N100m ransom\n\nGumi, who spoke to one of our correspondents on the telephone, lamented that his efforts, which had been yielding fruits, were not being appreciated by the government.\n\nHe said, \u201c The money they are asking for is too much; if I give you that money, you cannot run away with it. Nobody can run. So, why not give them the money, they release the boys and then we pursue them and get our money back and do what is necessary; it is simple logic. So, bring the money from the central bank. How can they move that money? We should not be stupid.\n\n\u201cThese people are getting infiltrated; Boko Haram is getting close and they don\u2019t respect the clergy. I need support to get them inoculated against the infiltration of these ideologies, whether Boko Haram or Ansaru, whatever it is. We need to shield them because they are na\u00efve. If there is too much pressure on them, and they see help from Boko Haram, who are richer and have more weapons, it is going to consume everybody.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with journalists on Tuesday, the National President of the Parents Teacher Association, Haruna Danjuma, urged the bandits to spare the lives of the innocent students.\n\nAlso, the National President, Foundation for The Protection of Women and Children, Hajiya Ramatu Tijjani, appealed to the abductors for the sake of the Holy Month of Ramadan, not to kill any student.\n\nThe two groups made the appeal as one of the kidnapped students of the Greenfield University regained freedom.\n\nIt was learnt that the student was released on Saturday before the bandits made their fresh demands on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lauretta Attahiru, mother of the released student, confirmed the development to journalists. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nTHE Federal Government has said that not less than five million Nigerians will benefit from a digital upskilling programme being made possible by a partnership arrangement with the Microsoft Corporation.\n\nAlso, locations in each of the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria would enjoy active internet connection and cloud services courtesy of this digital transformation plan.\n\nThe partnership with Microsoft Corporation anchored on connectivity, skilling and digital transformation followed discussions between both parties, led by the Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and Microsoft President, Brad Smith, earlier in the year.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, on Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe statement said that the Buhari administration was partnering with the tech giant to accelerate Nigeria\u2019s certain advance towards a more digital economy in line with the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\nFor instance in January this year, the Vice President had a virtual meeting with the Microsoft Corporation President, Mr Brad Smith, where discussions covered areas of intersection between technology and governance to enhance Nigeria\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nSpeaking in a formal video announcement of the partnership with the tech giant, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cour government is committed to leveraging innovation and technology to bring better outcomes across a wide area of governance concerns. Indeed, it is with this in mind that we have sought constructive partnerships that bridge the knowledge, skills and technology gap that exist in most of our communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis launch is indicative of our commitment to this and will involve collaboration with various government agencies as implementing partners, including the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigerian Institute of Cultural Orientation, and various other local partners.\n\n\u201cWe intend that these initiatives become institutions in their own rights and make a real impact in the lives of our citizens going forward.\u201d\n\nOn the core areas of the partnership, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cthis partnership will focus on two pillars: Connectivity & Skilling, and Digital Transformation.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cwe plan to connect under-served communities in each of the six geo-political zones with access to internet and cloud services. This project is a critical component of our objective of expanding broadband connectivity, which is by itself, a major pillar of our Economic Sustainability Plan in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWorking with Microsoft, we intend to upskill 5 million Nigerians through this increased internet access over the next three years in various digital skills which will increase both employability and entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cThe multiplier effect will bring opportunities in rural and urban areas to many young people and will help us deal with unemployment problems made worse by the pandemic\u201d, he said.\n\nUsing digital tools under the project, the Vice President said \u201cwe will pioneer innovative approaches in the fight against corruption, a major priority of this administration.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the Vice President said, \u201cleveraging Microsoft\u2019s Technology tools which can be deployed to minimise governance risks and block loopholes, working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), we will seek to use cutting edge analytical and case management tools to plug holes in our public sector system as well as confront white-collar criminality efficiently.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cThis pillar will also serve a vital social function. by using Microsoft\u2019s Artificial Intelligence technology and resources to preserve and promote our major languages so we can revitalize these important aspects of our culture.\n\n\u201cOur focus is of course the Nigerian people. With over 80 million regular internet users, there is no question that Nigerians have fully embraced technology, the internet and their various uses,\u201d the Vice President added.\n\nOn his part, the President of Microsoft Corporation, Mr Brad Smith said the \u201cwe believe in the future of Nigeria and we are excited as a company to add to our investments. It is a country we have had the opportunity to get to know better over the last few years.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith \u201cin 2018 we partnered with Tek experts to create a Customer Support Centre, a centre in Lagos that employs over 1,600 people. And then we had another opportunity to broaden our investment even more by creating our African Development Centre.\n\n\u201cA centre that, by the end of this year, will employ over 200 software developers and engineers, people who are creating technology and Microsoft products to serve not only the people of Nigeria but the people of the world.\n\n\u201cAll of these is giving us the kind of confidence to want to invest even more. And one of the things that we have recognized as a company is the need to grow with communities and countries and not just buying for ourselves\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the new partnership with the Federal Government, Mr Smith said \u201cwe are embarking on a series of broad-based, really multifaceted investments to better serve Nigeria in three areas of internet connectivity, digital skilling and digital transformation. We will be providing digital skills to 5 million Nigerians over the next three years, and along the way, creating 27,000 new jobs during the same period.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Sen. Pauline Tallen, has said 30 per cent of women and girls between the ages of 15-49 experience different forms of sexual abuse.\n\nTallen said this, on Tuesday in Abuja, at a panel discussion to commemorate the International Day of the Midwife 2021, and the Orange World Campaign Flag-off.\n\nThe theme of the event was, \u201cAccess to Services For GBV Survivors in Nigeria: A Call to Action.\u201d\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the advocacy event was organised by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), as part of its mandate of engaging health professional associations in ending Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) in Nigeria.\n\nTallen attributed the rising number sexual abuse, especially in the North East, to prevailing factors like child marriage and terrorism.\n\nThe minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mrs. Anthonia Ekpa, said Nigeria experienced different forms of sexual abuse, and that the patriarchal nature of the society.\n\n\u201cThe situation has further worsened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which has been described as a shadow pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has seen a surge on reports of gender-based violence cases nationwide, which has led to the diversion of priorities and resources to address these issues.\n\n\u201cThere is continuous advocacy and ongoing amendments to existing policies to accommodate best practices in combating this pandemic,\u201d she explained.\n\nTallen noted that a recent study commissioned by her Ministry and the United Nations (UN) partners in Nigeria, with support from the Norwegian government found out that 28 per cent of Nigerians aged 25-29 had experienced some form of physical violence since age 15.\n\n\u201cThe study also reports that 15 per cent of women experienced physical violence, and the level of exposure to the risk of violence varied based on marital status.\n\n\u201cIt said 44 per cent of divorced, separated or widowed women reported experiencing violence since age 15, while 25 per cent of married women or those living with their spouses have experienced violence,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the most common acts of violence against women in the country included sexual harassment, physical violence, harmful traditional practices, emotional and psychological violence and socio-economic violence.\n\n\u201cWhat do Nigerian women want to see? Sustaining advocacy and empowerment.\n\n\u201cAs I keep reiterating in my past discussions on GBV, there is need to intensify community level advocacy on gender based violence from federal to state, down to the grassroots,\u201d said Tallen.\n\nShe added that there was need to take up challenges as they emerged, as the statistics on prevalence of GBV were scary.\n\n\u201cThe issue of gender-based violence is at the center of human rights; there are two sides to it, which are gender inequality and violence against women,\u201d Tallen stressed.\n\nMs. Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary General, speaking at the event virtually, said there was no excuse for GBV survivors not to have access to services in the country.\n\n\u201cI welcome all the collective and comprehensive actions on ending GBV in Nigeria. This is the kind of leadership the world needs and the UN stands ready to support you,\u201d Mohammed added.\n\nThe Director-General of the National Agency for the prohibition of trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Imaan Sulaiman \u2013Ibrahim, said the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP), was fully implemented in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIbrahim urged women and girls to report all forms of violence and human degradation to NAPTIP.\n\n\u201dWe have more trained and equipped personnel on violence issues than the police. They take it up and report to the police and then follow up,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking, Ms Elisabeth Mueller, UNFPA Representative in Nigeria, said in tackling Gender-based violence, Nigeria must create an enabling environment through collaboration and avoid blaming and shaming.\n\n\u201cEverytime we talk about Gender-based violence, we are talking about real people like us who are subjected to several forms of violence,\u201d Mueller noted.\n\nAccording to her, it is worrisome to know that Nigerians do not amplify the cases of violence women face on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cAlways remember to show love and care to girls and women. We should be able to pass the appropriate message across to people. We should also put a human face to our stories,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said about 18 million women in Nigeria had stories to tell regarding the issues of Sexual and Gender Based violence.\n\n\u201cWe need to support women and girls by standing up for each other always. We need to give them assurance that they will get justice. When we hold each others hand, then we are on the way to ending sexual and gender based violence,\u201d she stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026urge NASS to pass CIFIPN bill into law\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu, Abuja\n\nAs Nigerians live under siege and apprehension, experts under the auspices of Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria, CIFIPN, yesterday, called on Federal Government to use forensic technology to tackle rising insecurity.\n\nThe call was made in an address of welcome by the Pro-tem President, CIFIPN, Dr. Enape Victoria Ayishetu, at a press conference held on May 1, 2021, with a theme, \u2018Deploying Forensic Science to tackle Insecurity, Corruption, Fraud, and Cyber-Crimes to Prevent a Looming Devastating Effect on Nigerian Economy\u2019, which was held in Abuja.\n\nAyishetu who expressed concern over the spate of criminal activities said drastic action is required by the government to prevent escalation of the trend of violence and economic recession.\n\nShe also asserted that fight against crimes and insecurity in the country will remain a mirage if the government continues to apply the same strategy and approach the expected results will be the same.\n\nShe also warned that Nigeria is currently sitting on a time bomb that can detonate at any time if the right thing is not done urgently.\n\nShe said: \u201cOne of the biggest problems confronting Nigeria today is insecurity, fraud, corruption, and cybercrimes. Crimes of all kinds like killings, kidnappings, social media harking, cyber crimes, fraud, and corruption have been technologically enabled and what that means is that there is a need for a technologically enabled system to prevent these.\n\n\u201cThis cankerworm has eaten deep into the great fortune of our dear nation over time resulting in economic challenges like underdevelopment, rising unemployment situations, retrenchments, collapse of corporate organisations, banks, poor infrastructural development, and decay as well as national insecurity.\n\n\u201cSometimes, one gets disappointed looking at the position or state of affairs of the Nigerian economy as at the moment, with particular reference to the above-mentioned ills.\n\n\u201cIt has been quite embarrassing that in our very eyes as Professional Forensic Investigators in Nigeria, our country is descending into destruction day by day while the security situation has gone worst, and it will be very hard to repair if this is allowed to continue.\n\n\u201cNigeria is currently sitting on a time bomb that can detonate at any time if the right thing is not done urgently by embracing the use of forensic science and technology.\n\n\u201cThe chartered institute of forensic and investigative professionals of Nigeria is actually on a rescue mission if giving a legal backing. Those who do not know should please know it now, and ensure this indispensable body is giving legal backing without further delay.\n\n\u201cThis is so because Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria that should assist the government in putting preventing all these ills have not been given legal backing to enable them to do their job in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is high time Nigerian government starts looking beyond the normal ways of doing things. Crimes and criminalities are committed with technological tools, and that has made it sophisticated to handle.\n\n\u201cIt is no doubt that forensic is the last hope of this country Nigeria if the issue of insecurity must be put to rest, because with forensic investigation, fraudsters corrupt personalities who have contributed in putting the country into this mess will be brought to book, and those that are planning to go into same evil or crimes will be prevented with the use of forensic science and technology.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the use of forensic in dealings and preventing the menace cannot be over-emphasized.\u201d\n\nAccording to her fraud, corruption, and cybercrimes in Nigeria have now moved from billions of Naira to trillions of Naira, which research has shown that Nigeria has lost about N2 trillion in the past few years to fraud and cyber-crimes.\n\n\u201cMost of these crimes are committed through the internet (phishing and identity theft) of which no other ways of preventing them than forensic science and technology. No wonder the empty treasury and lack of unemployment for the youth has posed security implications to our country nationwide.\n\nShe also lamented that Nigeria is rated among countries with very poor fraud prevention records in the world, despite federal government\u2019s renewed efforts in tackling fraud, corruption cyber-crimes, and insecurity, \u201cvery little result has been achieved, especially in the area of securing a conviction against perpetrators of crimes in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe added that many of the cases, especially the high profile ones, are either thrown out of court for want of evidence or are unnecessarily delayed and stocked in court for years, due to one reason or the other.\n\n\u201cBesides, criminals, kidnappers, hoodlums, bandits, corrupt practitioners\u2019, killers, and others have hidden places only in the absence of forensic in a country. Other countries of the world like American, Europe, Asia, and others, have discovered the secret and the power of forensic investigation over the years, and it has helped them in dealing with crimes and insecurity problems in their countries\u201d, she stated.\n\nMeanwhile, she called on the National Assembly to consider passing the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria, CIFIPN, Bill into law for national interest that would salvage the worrisome situation the country finds itself.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the ability of the House of Representatives not to allow itself to be deceived or coerced by some individuals, group of individuals or so-called civil society organisation being sponsored by our detractors, etc, who have sworn to truncate this noble legislative process, due to their selfish, self-serving and parochial interests, borne out of the fact that they are unamenable to rationale reasoning and evolution of global dynamics in forensic investigations, as a panacea for handling criminal investigations in the 21st Century.\n\n\u201cThe initiative behind the proposed Bill is the realization that even though anti-corruption agencies have been established and numerous civil service reforms and laws to fight corruption have put in place by the government, they have been rendered as a toothless bulldog, which can only bark but incapable to bite because their operations, has, to a certain degree, been limited due to the archaic nature of carrying out an investigation.\n\n\u201cHence, the need for a profession like ours, imbued with a high level of competence to proffer solutions to the menace of fraud and corruption in Nigeria, to be backed with the required legislative/legal framework to carry out this herculean task.\n\n\u201cThe Bill is for the interest of Nigerians and to give hope to the future generation and even our children yet unborn. It is now or never\u201d, she said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

The unbearable happenstances are the fact that there will be signals that an attack will happen, they will happen and nothing will happen.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of Nigerian students has risen in unity to demands that our leaders and leadership of Nigeria, irrespective of political leanings, should come together and solve the rising insecurity in Nigerian universities.\n\n\u201cRecent attacks have taken place in Greenfield University, Kaduna State, where over 40 students were kidnapped and about five of them killed, National College of Forestry, Kaduna where over 29 students were kidnapped, and the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Benue State, to mention but a few.\n\nIn the East, the ravaging issues of incessant killings of young students by suspected rival cult groups and herders conflict have also taken a new dimension with growing threats to peace and conducive learning environment we have enjoyed over the years.\n\n\u201cFew weeks ago, the Anambra State capital Awka, witnessed what could be simply referred as a \u201cbattleground\u201d by suspected rival cult groups which claimed the lives of many leaders of tomorrow.\n\n\u201cJust recently, the students of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University took to their heels over an attack by hoodlums within the \u201coff-campus\u201d residence of the students:-\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that in the past few months, we have witnessed deadly attacks and kidnapping of students across higher institutions in Nigeria and at least, not fewer than over 100 students have been kidnapped by bandits with a good number of others still missing.\n\n\u201cThis ugly development has disrupted academic learning in most of the institutions under attacks. Beyond the disruption of the academic curriculum, these raging attacks have far-reaching impacts on the psycho-social lives of the students.\n\n\u201cMore critical is the fact that we are getting into another election year in Nigeria with an imminent one coming up in Anambra State on the 6th November 2021. With the growing threats of insecurity as of today, the Nigerian students are worried over the fact that most electoral polling units are located within campuses and we are further concerned over the safety of our students and the success of the elections in these polling units within the campuses.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on the government to commence immediate proactive and pragmatic actions in other to restore the confidence of the students in campuses and salvaging the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe that, if not checked at the moment, our country will suffer untold difficulties that will be posed by the leadership of the Nigerian students.\n\n\u201cAs students, we know that the security of lives and welfare of the people is the primary responsibility of the government and as a result, we humbly appeal to our President, His Excellency, Muhamadu Buhari to step up and come to the rescue of the Nigerian students and the Nigerian society at large\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur country is asymmetrically navigating into \u2018stateless\u2019 society where life was nasty, brutish, and short. We believe that if concerted efforts are taken now, Nigeria will come out of these challenges stronger and better.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "In a tragic development, a beer fight ended in tragedy after a man burnt himself and his girlfriend to death following a dispute over money for beer.\n\nJoel Mphela of Jeffesville in Atteridgeville, Tshwane allegedly went beserk after his girlfriend Ntombifuthi Mabala (38) refused to give him money.\n\nA fight allegedly broke out between the two as Mphela kept on demanding for the money.\n\nAccording to Ntombifuthi\u2019s relative Jackson Zulu, Mpela became violent and insulted Ntombifuthi after she refused to him the money for beer.\n\nIn a fit of rage Mphela allegedly locked the gate and door and went on to pour paraffin all over the shack before setting it on fire.\n\nLuckily their kids managed to escape from the inferno with no injuries.\n\nNeighbors told Daily Sun that they heard the kids crying and screaming for help. They saw huge flames, but couldn\u2019t enter as the gate and door were locked.\n\nTshwane emergency services managed to put out the fire but it was already too late. Firefighters discovered the bodies of a man and woman who were declared dead by paramedics.\n\nThe Tshwane emergency services said the cause of the fire has not been determined yet.\n\nMapula Rikhotso from Atteridgeville Police Station said an inquest docket was opened. He added that investigations were already underway as they are trying to determine if there was any foul play.\n\nUncle Lazarus Mphela (44) said Mphela was a good and kind man. He said he is finding it hard to believe that Mphela went to such lengths just because of alcohol.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is he was controlled by alcohol when drunk. He introduced Ntombifuthi to us in December and even told me he loved her. It\u2019s sad to see what happened,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the couple\u2019s tragic death, community leader Samuel Masilela has since called on his community members and well-wishers to assist the couple\u2019s children with a shack, clothes, food, school uniforms, and all documents as everything burnt in the fire.\n\nDailySun ZA",

          "text": "By Oladeji Adeola\n\nTravelling by road could be an amazing experience, depending solely on where you are heading, your purpose of visiting and the mode of transport.\n\nTravelling by road is cheap and very exciting. It enables you to sight see, interact and take pictures along the way. It is a flexible mode of transport as it gives you the options of cancelling or setting out without much preparation.\n\nTo leave the shores of Nigeria legally by road, you are required to have a Nigerian passport, Valid Identification Card, Yellow card or certificate that shows you\u2019ve been vaccinated from Yellow fever and of course Money.\n\nHere are some African countries you can travel to as a Nigerian:\n\n1. GHANA: The journey from Nigeria to Ghana by road is quite a long one but it\u2019s the scenic route. So brace yourself for the adventure. You can either choose to go directly with a transport company or hire out a taxi to take you. You can also get a bus from Jibowu or Maza maza heading to Accra or Weija.\n\nGhana has great street foods, tourist markets and amazing people. To avoid extortion on the road, arm yourself with your passport, yellow card and Ghana Cedis before travelling. It is also advisable to have other means of identification like a driver\u2019s license or a student/work ID Card.\n\n2. MALI: Travelling by road to Mali, a sub-Sahara African country is more popular and cheaper through Northern Nigeria. The famous Katsina \u2013Maradi route is still in operation regardless of the hiccups on the way. Another alternative is to board a vehicle from Togo heading to Mali or go to Northern Ghana and board a bus.\n\n3. CAMEROON: To travel to Cameroon, first you need to head to Akwa Ibom in Southern Nigeria from where you\u2019ll travel to the city of Calabar. The second half of the journey is to the town of Ekom and to the Cameroonian border. Lastly, you can board a bus from Ekok to Douala.\n\n4. IVORY COAST: Ivory Coast, also known as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is a country located on the south coast of West Africa. Travelling to Ivory Coast by road allows you to see some nice places in Cotonou, Togo and Ghana and take good pictures of them.\n\nBasically, travelling to Ivory Coast by road is good for sightseeing. You can board a bus going to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire by road in Maza Maza, Lagos State.\n\n5. BENIN REPUBLIC: There are a lot of amazing places for sight-seeing and fun activities in this country, places like Hotel Benin Marina Beach, The Pendjari National Park and Cotonou craft market.\n\nIf you won\u2019t be traveling with a transport company, you can board a bus at Mile 2 Motor Park in Lagos going to the borders of Seme. From there, you can board a taxi to Cotonou.\n\n6. TOGO: Togo is a country in West Africa bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north. The country extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, where its capital Lom\u00e9 is located.\n\nYou can travel to Togo with transport companies or board a bus at Mile 2 Motor Park in Lagos.\n\n7. SIERRA LEONE: Sierra Leone is on the southwest coast of West Africa. It is bordered by Liberia to the southeast and Guinea to the northeast. The capital of Sierra Leone and its largest city is Freetown.\n\nYou can travel directly from Lagos to Freetown with a transport company or by a private car. If you are looking for a cheaper way to get to Sierra Leone from Nigeria by road, Mile 2 Motor Park in Lagos is your other option. There you can select the vehicle that you wish to convene you.",

The security situation in Nigeria is deteriorating rapidly and ordinary Nigerians are living in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. Nowhere seems to be safe. Farms, markets, schools, homes, mosques, churches, and urban areas are all affected.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are spreading their areas of operation beyond the Northeast, into far flung areas as far as Niger State in the North-Central. That is merely hours from our Federal Capital.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for decisive leadership and I call on the Federal Government to consider recalling all ex-servicemen and women, who are willing to return to service, and take the fight to the insurgents, until they are rolled back and defeated.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that \u201cthe men and women of Nigeria\u2019s armed forces, whether serving or retired, who restored peace to Lebanon, Liberia, Sierra Leone and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe can, and should be used to do the same in the motherland.\n\n\u201cBut they need arms and ammunition.

The main opposition party said it was dropping the toga of politics in the national interest.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the PDP did not respect its own words, as it played cheap politics while playing the Ostrich.

          "text": "\u2022Threatens to \u2018ruffle unruly feathers\u2019\n\n\u2022Accusation baseless, PDP, Afenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN fire back\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe presidency yesterday accused some religious and political leaders of plotting to forcibly remove President Muhammadu Buhari from office, warning that it would thwart the moves and ruffle some unruly feathers in the process.\n\nThe presidency, however, came under fire as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere; the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in separate reactions dismissed the allegation.\n\nThe main opposition party described the allegation as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nAfenifere said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said in a statement that available evidence indicated that some disgruntled religious and past political leaders are poised to throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel an undemocratic change of leadership.\n\nAdesina\u2019s statement came a day after the Department of State Services (DSS) alleged that some \u201cmisguided elements\u201d were threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nDSS spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Monday, had said that among those threatening the federal government and Nigeria\u2019s unity are \u201csome religious and past political leaders who have either called for a forceful change of government or mass action against it.\u201d\n\nThe presidency in a reaction to the DSS yesterday said there is proof that the disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of a conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed on the president, thus throwing the land into turmoil.\n\nIt stated: \u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country. The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nIt added that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999 and the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\u201d\n\nThe presidency also accused external forces of collaborating with some individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such moves.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country. But the presidency, already vested with mandate and authority by Nigerians till 2023, pledges to keep the country together, even if some unruly feathers would be ruffled in the process,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some analysts told THISDAY last night that the presidency might have been reacting to a grand move by some past leaders of the country to hold a conference to discuss the state of the nation, which they said had been hemmed by massive violence from non-state actors, including bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and separatist elements.\n\nThe conference being facilitated by a former head of state is expected to be attended by leaders of prominent regional political groups, civil society organisations, religious leaders and past political office holders.\n\nThe groundwork had reached an advanced stage and state intelligence agencies and the presidency, the analysts, said may have panicked in the fear that the conference in dissecting the litany of woes that have befallen the country may throw up conversations and conclusions that are certain to embarrass the Buhari administration.\n\nThis is Blackmail, PDP Fires Back\n\nReacting to the allegation, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed it, describing it as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe PDP said rather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing the nation, the presidency was engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that the Buhari presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically-elected government.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cThe presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically-elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood.\n\n\u201cEven in 2019, Nigerians will be quick to remember how the APC imported bandits, vandals and thugs from neighbouring countries, as political mercenaries, to unleash violence, disrupt our voting processes and muscle itself into power.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the presidency and the APC to look inwards for those allegedly plotting to upturn democracy.\n\n\u201cOur party believes that the statement by the Buhari presidency is an attempt by the APC to heighten political tension in our country ahead of the 2023 election, having realised that they cannot face the people at the polls,\u201d it added.\n\nThe PDP, however, advised the APC to know that such blackmail against Nigerians cannot work.\n\n\u201cFor us in the PDP, our party will remain undeterred, alongside other patriotic Nigerians, in our commitment towards the sustenance and stability of our democracy as well as the unity and corporate existence of our country, Nigeria,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN Dismiss allegation\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF and the CAN also dismissed the allegation by the presidency that some religious and political leaders are part of a plot to overthrow Buhari.\n\nThe leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the whole world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that given Buhari\u2019s poor performance, there is no need for any group to \u201cgather anywhere to pass a vote of no confidence in him.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo, who described the 1999 Constitution as a fraud, also urged the president to, as a matter of urgency, return the 1964 Constitution agreed on by the founding fathers of Nigeria, including the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho is interested in passing vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him? That is not the issue. The main thing is to restructure the country back to federalism and forget all these gossips by Adesina. We don\u2019t have to pass a vote of no confidence for the world to know we don\u2019t have any confidence in Buhari.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any group who wants to take over the government, but I know those of us who want the country to be restructured in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cThose of us in Afenifere and all other groups in the South who are agitating for restructuring are the friends of Nigeria, are the friends of Buhari. I hope it is not too late for Buhari to realise this.\u201d\n\nACF also said it was wrong for the presidency to see all its critics as disgruntled people with ulterior motives.\n\nThe spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, told THISDAY that the presidency should be broad-minded and tolerate all shades of opinions.\n\nAccording to him, many criticisms against the government are done in good faith to help improve the situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany criticisms are done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the president and his team were becoming confused.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president and his team have gone blind and confused since in their world view, Rev. Father Mbaka and others who are telling them the truth about what is happening in the country have now become enemies.\n\n\u201cYou should know they have run out of excuses and have turned to blackmail even those who love them and want them to do what is good for the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEvery religious leader who chooses to stand with the people and is demanding good governance is now disgruntled.\u201d\n\nThe CAN chairman said the presidency needed \u201cto pause a little and remember that these people whom they are calling names today stood with them and for them when those who think they know them more warned against it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians have since passed their vote on Buhari and his government after watching helplessly how bandits have taken over the country; our young university students are being killed and destroyed.\u201d\n\nHayab appealed to those who are making statements on behalf of the presidency to be careful with their poor words and strive to win the support and confidence of the people with love and facts, not blackmail.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the CAN President on Media and Communications, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said beyond praying for things to get better, religious leaders reserved the right to criticise the authorities if they were not doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf the government accused some religious and past political leaders of planning to remove President Muhammadu Buhari, in what ways has that concerned the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)? The biblical responsibilities of the church include but not limited to praying for those who are in the position of authority but to criticise when doing wrongs or performing below the average. Check the Bible; there was never a time a bad ruler was spared from criticism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the government should pre-occupy itself with how best to tackle insecurity and ensure the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cOur candid advice to the government is to find an answer to the menace of insecurity occasioned by the bandits, kidnappers and terrorists. The country is approaching the precipice and President Muhammadu Buhari is in the position of rescuing the country by stopping the unprecedented bloodshed.\n\n\u201cIt is only the fool that goes to bed when his roof is on fire. Our members and non-members are being kidnapped and killed while the government appears helpless,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, fixing the security challenges is beyond issuing press releases or threatening to deal with the criminals.\n\nHe stated that 24 hours after Buhari vowed never to tolerate any banditry attack on schools, the bandits struck, adding that the victims are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cWhat is the government doing to rescue the victims? Some university students who were kidnapped in Kaduna are being killed but the government is too busy threatening the critics. We advise the presidency to recall all the promises made by Buhari during the electioneering and what is happening under his watch. Until his government wakes up to its responsibilities, the church will not keep quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a reaction, PANDEF National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, expressed shock that the presidency would under the prevailing situation of disastrous insecurity tag religious leaders and past political leaders \u201cdisgruntled.\u201d\n\nHe said such a statement was the least expected from government.\n\nThe group urged the presidency to stop chasing shadows, stressing that Nigerians are anxious, troubled and many are becoming hopeless over the worsening insecurity, while the security agencies appear helpless and vulnerable.\n\nPANDEF asked Buhari to involve all critical stakeholders nationwide in efforts at finding solutions to the problems facing the nation.\n\nIt said: \u201cWhat we expect from President Muhammadu Buhari, at this time, is to rally all critical stakeholders, from all sectors and sections of the country, to build national consensus and fashion out collective and holistic ways to address the hybrid problems confronting the country. This is not the time for arbitrary statements.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abductors free one more captive\n\n\u2022Security council meeting continues today\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed its commitment to do all it could to save the remaining 16 students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, whose abductors have threatened to kill for the delay in ransoming them.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja where he faulted the recommendations by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in resolving the growing insecurity in the country, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the federal government, in line with its constitutional responsibility of protecting all Nigerians, would not fold its arms and allow the bandits who kidnapped the students execute them.\n\nThe bandits had on Monday threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom was not met by yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by yesterday, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nOf the about 22 students abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm, the bandits have killed five.\n\nHowever, the bandits might have reconsidered their decision to kill the remaining students yesterday as one of them was freed under a yet-to-be-clear circumstances. Their parents also appealed to the bandits to spare the lives of the students.\n\nAt the press conference in Abuja, Mohammad also spoke on efforts by the federal government to combat the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHowever, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the three service chiefs will tomorrow brief the Senate on their efforts so far to address the security problems.\n\nMohammed also faulted the recommendations by the PDP in resolving the security crisis, saying the contents of its recent press conference had exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of Monday\u2019s press briefing by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in which he canvassed, among others, state police, devolution of powers and the establishment of border protection council, as part of steps to combat insecurity.\n\nMohammed accused PDP of merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\nThe minister also threatened to expose the forces behind the current security challenges at the \u2018\u2019appropriate time\u2019\u2019 and deal with them.\n\nHe stated that the alarm raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) on the plot by some powerful forces to destabilise the government only confirmed the consistent position of the federal government that there were plots by some political forces to make the country ungovernable.\n\nHe said the federal government was shocked that \u2018\u2019a party that ruled the country for all of 16 years does not know that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offences.\u201d\n\nIt advised the PDP to call out the states, including those being controlled by it, to ensure a rigorous prosecution of arrested kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u2018\u2019PDP conveniently forgot that as far as terrorism, a federal offence, is concerned, this federal government has successfully prosecuted thousands of Boko Haram members in Kainji, as part of a continuing exercise. We are now seeking the cooperation of the judiciary to continue with the trial of arrested terrorists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister explained that while PDP claimed to have ostensibly offered suggestions to the federal government on some topical issues, especially national security by dropping the toga of politics in the national interest, the party played cheap politics.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019The party went ahead to make wild accusations against the president and his government. For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a government of exclusion.\n\n\u2018\u2019The opposition party then went ahead to reel out a number of suggestions as a way out of the current challenges facing the nation. Unfortunately, the recommendations by the PDP have exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry, and the fact that it was merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\n\u2018\u2019Had it not been so, and had it done its homework properly, the PDP would have known that most of those same recommendations were already contained in the outcome of the federal government\u2019s town hall meeting on national security, which was held in Kaduna on April 8, 2021,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\n\nAbductors Free One More Kaduna Student\n\nMeanwhile, one of the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, has been released.\n\nThe mother of the released student, Mrs. Lauretta Attahiru, confirmed this yesterday to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nShe, however, declined to make further comments on how her son was released.\n\nThe police could not also be reached to confirm the release of the student as Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police command, did not respond to telephone calls and a text message.\n\nThe parents had earlier said the bandits had been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20 million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students remained uncertain yesterday, especially given the bandits\u2019 threat to kill them over the inability to ransom them.\n\nAlso yesterday, the President of the National Association of Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTA), Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, pleaded with the bandits to spare the lives of their victims.\n\nDanjuma told journalists in Kaduna that the parents of the affected students and Nigerians had been gripped by fear and tension following the threat by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cWe are simply begging them not to kill any other student in view of the fact that they are innocent.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is really worrisome and we as parents, are concerned and worried over the lives of our students and teachers of the university,\u201d he said.\n\nA former senator who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, also appealed to Fulani socio-cultural groups to intercede to secure the release of the students.\n\nSani tweeted that he had privately appealed to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore to help secure the release of the students.\n\nSecurity Council Meeting Continues Today\n\nMeanwhile, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja, to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting, which will be the third in less than a week, will as usual be presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIndications that the meeting will continue today was emerged when yesterday\u2019s meeting ended without any media briefing or press statement issued.\n\nAlso, the President of the Senate, Dr .Ahmad Lawan, at Senate plenary on why the CDS and the service chiefs could not appear before the senators yesterday, said at the commencement of plenary that the military top brass could not honour invitation due to the National Security Council meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, the National Security Council is continuing its meeting that it started last week. Therefore the invited security heads will not be able to come for the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure if they will finish their meeting today (Tuesday). We assume it could spill to Wednesday too,\u201d he added.\n\nLawan, however, said the CDS and the service chiefs would brief the Senate tomorrow on the security situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have now fixed the date for the briefing to be Thursday, May 6,\u201d adding that the briefing will enrich the knowledge of his colleagues about security issues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Mergers of MDAs, budget review on the card\n\n\u2022Akabueze proposes six-region structure\n\nNdubuisi Francis, Olawale Ajimotokan and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has initiated a raft of measures to cut the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue occasioned by the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant global economic tailspin.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said yesterday in Abuja that the measures were targeted at reducing recurrent expenditure, which is projected to gulp about 41.5 per cent of the total provisions of N13.588 trillion in the 2021 budget, amounting to N5.64 trillion.\n\nShe stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the salaries and wages committee to review the payroll of public servants as well as consider the merger of some agencies.\n\nBesides, the government will also remove some unnecessary items from the budget as a move to cut the cost of governance.\n\nAhmed spoke at a policy dialogue on \u2018corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practice and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nAlso at the occasion, the Director-General, Budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, proposed a constitutional amendment to pave the way for the restructuring of the country into six regions instead of the present 36 states structure. This, he said, would help to reduce the rising cost of governance.\n\nAhmed stated that the proposed cost-saving measures was aimed at streamlining government expenditure with revenue.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue.\u201d\n\nShe urged all government agencies to come together to trim the cost amid the country\u2019s dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the nation\u2019s budgets are filled every year with projects that are recycled and that are also not necessary.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair, work together with the head of service and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister said the federal government would also review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates, adding that the government will consider merging two agencies with the same mandate.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe need to work together; all agencies of the government to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures\u2013expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year-in-year out with projects that we see over and over again and also projects that are not necessary.\u201d\n\nAkabueze, in a paper titled: \u2018Reducing the Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 described the country\u2019s current system of democratic governance as very expansive and expensive.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that mandated the president to appoint a minister from at least each of the 36 states, should be amended to reduce the number of federal cabinet members.\n\nHe cited the large federal structure to be one of the drivers of the high cost of governance and engendering public outcry that government spending is largely on recurrent activities at the expense of capital projects.\n\nWhile describing the subsisting fiscal policy as unsustainable, Akabueze said the persistent call for the reduction of governance cost had continued to gain momentum in view of its impact on government fiscal situation.\n\nHe stated that the cost of governance is considerably cheaper in the United States from where Nigeria copied the presidential system of government.\n\nAccording to him, the general cost of administration in the United States is less than 10 per cent of the total annual budgets while the United States, with a higher population than Nigeria, has only 15 secretaries and executive departments as against Nigeria, which has 27 ministers, 16 ministers of state and 27 ministries.\n\nHe lamented that the federal government is maintaining 943 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) with many of them having duplicated functions.\n\n\u201cThere are 541 federal government-owned public corporations and enterprises. We need to cut these in order to install efficiency in governance. Also, we have a bloated civil service. The current civil service structure and size is clearly unsustainable for Nigeria\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warned against the tendency where the civil service is accorded political, ethnic and religious patronage.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive staff auditing and job available is imperative to determine the right size of the federal civil service without having any adverse effect on the service. And to avoid duplication in the civil service, the staff rationalisation programme should be gradual,\u201d he added.\n\nAkabueze said the federal government\u2019s recurrent spending accounted for more than 75 per cent of the actual MDAs expenditure between 2011 and 2020, in addition to personnel cost which accounted for government significant spending.\n\nHe accused the MDAs of incurring excessive personnel costs and wilfully indulging in wide range of underhand practices that are driving governance cost out of the ordinary.\n\nAccording to him, in 2016, personnel cost was N1.87 trillion while at the moment the same cost has spiralled to over N3 trillion.\n\nThe effect of the rising cost of running government, Akabueze added, is the reason why only 30 per cent of the budget is available for capital project and the cause behind many abandoned capital projects nationwide.\n\nHe said: \u201cPersonnel cost accounted for 31 per cent and 63 per cent of the total spending and retained revenue in 2020. In the USA, the general administration cost is less than 10 per cent of total budget.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe challenged Nigerians to task themselves on governance, saying that the success story of the Asian Tiger was a product of sound leadership and determination.\n\nICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, described the cost of governance as the driver of corruption in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government was committed to improving the country\u2019s revenue by focusing on new and existing sources and by streamlining payroll.\n\nHe added that the federal government would also ensure removal of subsidies and reduction in the cost of contracts and procurement are for the benefits of the vulnerable.\n\nHe listed critical area of concern to include payroll padding and the phenomenon of ghost workers.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s intended cost-cutting approach is coming amid a report by a public finance transparency advocacy firm, BudgIT that the 2021 federal budget contains over 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion.\n\nBudgIT, a public finance transparency advocacy firm, said in a report that the duplication of projects was just one among other loopholes for corruption in the budget.\n\nIt added that there were no audit records of N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\n\nIt said: \u201cOur investigations into the 2021 budget revealed at least 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion, with 115 of those duplicate projects occurring in the Ministry of Health. This is very disturbing, especially considering the health infrastructure deficit and the raging COVID-19 pandemic affecting Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBudgIT also found zero audit records of the N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\u201d\n\nIt also alleged that budgetary provisions were made for agencies for projects that are beyond their execution. It added: \u201cEven worse, agencies now receive allocations for capital projects they cannot execute. For example, the National Agriculture Seed Council has an allocation for N400m to construct solar street lights across all six geopolitical zones, while the Federal College of Forestry in Ibadan in Oyo State got N50m for the construction of street lights in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThese are aberrations that need to be corrected.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences\u201d.\n\nIt also accused external forces of collaborating with the mischievous individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such move.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country.

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fifth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on conversations with investors in Africa \u2013 investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, private equities, venture capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nYele Bademosi didn\u2019t start out in the tech space. Being born to parents in the medical field, he attempted to toe that same line. When he gained admission to study medicine at King\u2019s College London, it seemed like his path had been charted, until a few years later when he dropped out. Medicine just wasn\u2019t his passion.\n\nAfter leaving medical school, he launched his first startup in the UK \u2013 Purple, a social app that let university students with shared interests in the UK find and connect with each other. After efforts to scale the social media app proved abortive, he shut down the project and flew back to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, he got a job as a general manager of Starta \u2013 an online community and resource platform for African startup entrepreneurs. He helped Starta reach over 24,000 subscribers in eight months before it was acquired in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, after developing a taste for helping startups get off the ground, he founded Microtraction, an early-stage venture capital fund that has gone on to invest in over 15 startups.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed Director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of crypto platform, Binance. He was charged with developing Africa\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. He held this role until April 2020.\n\nIn August 2019, he founded Bundle, a social payments app for cash and cryptocurrency.\n\nOur conversation began with trying to understand what spurred Badamosi to hop on the venture capital train earlier than most people.\n\nYele Bademosi: I think the ecosystem is a lot different today than it was five years ago when I initially began thinking about the idea for Microtraction (MT).\n\nFor context, I spent about nine months working with Dotun, who is also a VC at Novastar. One of the things that we were doing was trying to help entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses through knowledge and networks. I realized from that experience that it was difficult for founders to raise money.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t really have any other avenue if they didn\u2019t have a network or a rich relative. That was what really drove this idea. How do we create an easier way for founders to raise money?\n\nAnother thing was the incubation model, which was also popular in Nigeria at the time, wasn\u2019t really a good fit for the market. We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\n\nI wanted to find an alternative means to invest and support entrepreneurs. This birthed the MT model. This idea of an open application for funding with fixed check sizes without a program or a demo day was something that was unique at the time and MT was the first vehicle to do something like that.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What did Micro traction think was missing?\n\nYB: For us, it was more about streamlining. People went into a physical space with a batch of other companies and at the end, there was a demo day. That was the norm \u2013 the YC model. Interestingly, we raised capital from a bunch of limited partners, including Michael Siebel (YC\u2019s CEO).\n\nWe didn\u2019t do programs because we felt that the materials that were being taught weren\u2019t entirely applicable to Nigeria and Africa at large. We also felt that that drove up the costs of running this program. You would spend anything from 60-80% on programs and only deploy maybe 20%. So from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\n\nThe second critical part was the batch model. You can\u2019t predict the timeline of the creation of quality companies. We felt that when you invest in batches, you end up investing in companies that may not be ready to take on external capital yet, or might not be venture backable. What we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\n\nThe third thing was this idea of demo days. I\u2019ve been to a number of demo days. Some of them were very well prepared, presented, and executed, but when you looked at the amount of funding that was picked up by these companies, it was quite low.\n\nWe prefer investor intros, building networks of investors, connecting our founders to investors who will invest in them.\n\nSo those three things: No batches, no programs, no demo days. That\u2019s what made the MT model unique.\n\nThe Microtraction Team\n\nDA: Interesting, I always thought MT was like YC. So what does your support look like?\n\nYB: It varies, there are a bunch of partners now at MT. My strength really is in product and business strategy. Chidinma, one of our partners, is very strong at financial operations for business and governance. Dayo is an ex-founder, he is able to provide first-hand experience of getting a business off the ground and what not to do or do. Ife is probably one of the best recruiters in the world. Antonia is our communications chief. Each person brings a unique set of skills that can help our companies.\n\nI think one thing we always tell founders, and I believe now more than ever especially since I\u2019ve started a startup is that a founder is what makes a company successful. We actually believe that our job is not to make \u2018okay\u2019 founders good, but to find great founders and cut the red tape or barriers that hinder them from building great companies.\n\nWe have a ton of various individuals and companies that are able to help our companies across hiring, fundraising, talent, business strategy, growth, regulatory and PR. A rolodex that you can go to get support and grow your company is very key. Now as the number of portfolio companies continues to scale, we also have a network of founders who are working in complementary spaces and they can learn from each other and connect with each other and open up their networks to each other.\n\nDA: What does a day look like at MT?\n\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies. Obviously, we spend more time with companies we\u2019ve just invested in versus a company that has been in our portfolio for three years.\n\nWe are also very honest with ourselves. We are a pre-seed fund. Our biggest impact is when you\u2019re getting off the ground; just having a listening ear and being able to help you think through the decisions that you want to make as a business.\n\nAnd as founders/ex-founders there\u2019s a very high level of empathy. We spend maybe 20% of our time networking with other investors and other players in the space or non-investors just building your network because your network is your capital as an investor. That\u2019s how we help our companies recruit or raise the next round of capital. 20% or 25% is spent talking to companies in our pipeline. The last 55% is spent on our portfolio companies.\n\nMT Partners, Dayo koleowo and Chidinma Iwueke\n\nDA: MT has a bias to invest in startups with technical founders/co-founders, why?\n\nYB: I think that really comes from my own experience as a founder. When I started my first company right out of leaving medical school, I tried without a technical founder and it was incredibly difficult.\n\nI raised money and spent money on outsourcing. Actually, I think I was fortunate with the developer I got because he actually built the product, but it took a long time because it wasn\u2019t the only thing he was working on. And it cost a lot of money. When I needed to make changes, I didn\u2019t have the capital to make the changes and I was extremely slow. It took about six, seven months to get to market.\n\nWhile this was going on, I had a friend in the UK who we used to build stuff together. He was technical, I was a product designer. We would have an idea on Thursday, meetup on Friday or Saturday, by Sunday evening we built something and it was on Play Store and App Store. It really confirmed to me the importance of having people on the team who have some kind of technical skill, because at the end of the day what gives a startup a high valuation is growth and what gives you the leverage for growth is the fact that your business is either software-based or tech-enabled in some way.\n\nIf we give you money and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders. We\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\n\nDA: MT offers only $25,000 for 7% equity to every company, why?\n\nYB: Essentially, it is more around standardisation. If we had to negotiate every single deal that we were going into, then it would be quite challenging. We\u2019re having numerous conversations because every investment we make, we\u2019re talking to another five or six companies. That\u2019s even at the investment committee level, at the second or third phone call or team call it\u2019s another 20 companies for every single investment. We think it\u2019s fair for these companies with little or no revenue but we also review our deal structure from time to time.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your due diligence process like and what\u2019s the time frame?\n\nYB: We have a due diligence checklist, essentially a lot of which is more around governance. Governance because we invest early in these companies, we make sure that the company has the right documents and structure to make them investible. We literally spend a lot of time actually getting documents like incorporation, founder vesting agreements, also reference calls \u2013 just things that show the company has good governance.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the areas that I think we can actually improve upon, which is saying, how much should you and can you fund an early-stage company that has not been in existence for a very long time. There are some that are less than a week because the company is prepared or usually it takes weeks, it depends on how prepared the company is.\n\nDayo Koleowo at TechCabal\u2019s Edtech Townhall\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nYB: When I think of what will make me not invest in this company, the first thing is market opportunity. How big can this business be? Venture capital is extremely skewed. It\u2019s really about maximum upside as opposed to protecting your downside. What I mean by that is when we invest in companies we try to project the best possible outcome for the company.\n\nSo if the maximum upside is still looking like a small company, then we won\u2019t invest. That\u2019s probably why we say no to the vast majority of companies.\n\nNumber two is the progress made over time. I ask myself, am I impressed with how fast the company has moved within a particular time period? For a lot of companies, their progress over time isn\u2019t impressive especially when there are other companies to benchmark in that space.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the team. How good is the team? I don\u2019t do this as much anymore, but when I first started, I used to ask myself a question \u2018would I work for this founder?\u2019\n\nIf I had just moved back, starting off my career in the Nigerian or African tech ecosystem, and I saw this company, would I want to join them? Obviously, after five years, it\u2019s not the same so I can\u2019t really use that same benchmark because things are a lot different. But I still ask would I love to work for this founder? A lot of times when the answer is yes, the team is usually very strong.\n\nThe intersection of team, market and progress over time is what we look at. When a company fails those things, I\u2019m typically not interested in investing.\n\nDA: How has Covid-19 affected MT?\n\nYB: We actually continued investing during the pandemic. COVID had a bigger effect on startups than investors because investors have already collected money upfront. As an investor, you\u2019re not directly affected, it will affect your portfolio companies. I think COVID-19 impacted the quantity and quality of deal flow \u2013 the rate at which we receive investment offers.\n\nDA: Any exits from your end?\n\nYB: At MT, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to exit some of our positions, but we\u2019ve not taken those offers primarily because we still believe that there are significant opportunities for these companies to grow. The beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments. Most people when they hear exits they think about exits like the Paystack exit but the less popular/more common exit is usually a secondary exit where an investor exits or sells some of its shares to an existing investor or incoming investor. What we\u2019ll learn with this ecosystem is that exits are just a matter of time and we\u2019ll definitely see more exits in the future.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the tech space?\n\nYB: We\u2019re going to see a lot of investments going into fintech. I think we are going to see larger rounds coming into the industry. They\u2019ll stimulate a lot more stuff up in crypto, but they will move beyond the exchanges. I think crypto will probably be the second or at least in the top five sectors. Recently, I was looking at deals I did at Binance labs. I think from a fundraising perspective those deals probably outperformed any group of recent investments given the time that they took to raise over a million within a year to 18 months.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see some innovations in real money gaming, not just sports betting, but through playing games where you can win/ lose some money or some prizes.\n\nI think there\u2019ll be some moves in what I call export services, or export software services, which are essentially entrepreneurs that build products offered to global markets. I would definitely love to invest in anyone that is building anything around those ideas \u2013 crypto, gaming and export services.",
          "summary": "We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\nSo from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\nWhat we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies.\nThe beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government recently announced a partnership with tech giant Microsoft to accelerate the country\u2019s digital economy. This announcement follows a discussion that took place in January between Nigeria\u2019s vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo and Microsoft\u2019s Corporation President, Brad Smith.\n\nThe collaboration is in line with Nigeria\u2019s economic sustainable plan to grow the economy. It will foster job opportunities and upskill up to five million people in Nigeria, creating over 27,000 new digital jobs in the next three years.\n\nIn a statement by Microsoft, they are setting a \u201cbig goal to bring access to digital skills to five million people in Nigeria over the next three years. But this is not something we can do by ourselves. We will equip master trainers and, along with them, are committed to creating thousands of new jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we have an enormous opportunity to put technology to work, create jobs, to foster the technology ecosystem across Nigeria, and to use technology to preserve the best of the past and take us into the future.\u201d\n\nAs seen on Microsoft\u2019s website, each of Nigeria\u2019s six geo-political zones will have access to high-speed internet infrastructure courtesy of the digital transformation plan.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Airband team will work closely with local partners to improve broadband connectivity in these communities while also assisting with the design and implementation of hyper-scale cloud services.\u201d\n\nOn their end, the Nigerian presidency believes that Microsoft\u2019s extensive experience with using technology as an enabler for public and social good makes them an ideal partner.\n\nThis collaboration will focus on three major areas of development. Connectivity, skilling and digital transformation. Microsoft says after extensive consultation with the Nigerian government, they identified these three areas as key pillars to building strong foundations for a digital economy in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft partnered with IT firm Tek Experts, to create a Customer Support Centre in Lagos. The centre, according to them, employs over 1,600 people. This new digital initiative is another opportunity the tech company has to broaden their investment even more in Nigeria.\n\nBrad Smith said in a tweet that the company believes in the future of Nigeria and that they are excited about this partnership.\n\nThe initiative will also help protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural heritage. Microsoft will deploy artificial intelligence tools to protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural treasures for generations to come. They will do this alongside the National Institute of Cultural Orientation to revive and preserve the country\u2019s three major indigenous languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.\n\n\u201cThis is one of my favourite projects that we pursue around the world. It uses the most advanced technology of the 21st century to nurture and keep alive the culture that has been so important for humanity from the centuries past,\u201d Brad says.",

          "text": "Texas, Lagos, and Mexico City; 29 April 2021: Platform Capital (\u201cPlatform\u201d), a leading growth markets investor, is pleased to announce it led a $1.3 million investment round into STRAP Technologies (\u201cSTRAP\u201d), an innovative company that has developed the world\u2019s first total technology replacement of the white cane for the blind & visually impaired.\n\nGlobally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindless, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden with the associated annual productivity losses estimated to be over $25.4 billion. The leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.\n\nSTRAP has developed a range of hardware and software solutions that address the mobility challenges that the blind and visually impaired encounter daily. After years of R&D and extensive testing, STRAP has integrated its solutions into a lightweight, chest-worn device that guides the blind and visually impaired by calculating the proximity of physical environments, allowing them to move unaided. This hands-free wearable harness uses haptic language to warn of hazards like an oncoming passer-by, walls, steps, and even changing elevations on sidewalks and other pathways. The company has received significant pre-orders from over 6,000 customers across North & Latin America and will ship its devices in Q4 2021. For a video overview of STRAP\u2019s technology in action, click here.\n\nThe company is also backed by International Accelerator and a group of Angel Investors. As part of Platform Capital\u2019s investment, Dr. Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Platform Capital, joins the Board of STRAP.\n\nDiego Roel, Founder and CEO of STRAP Technologies said \u201cSTRAP is the first assistive technology on the market that replaces the white cane that\u2019s been in use for over 100 years. I am inspired and excited by this recent investment and support in what STRAP is doing. The investment represents the belief in what we have accomplished and what we have been passionately working on these last three years in research and development. We appreciate the confidence of our investors in STRAP and strengthening our position for the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Ponmile Osibo, Partner at Platform Capital said \u201cWe are proud to partner with STRAP Technologies. Their innovative solution provides an exciting alternative for the white cane. We believe that this technology will impact millions of lives globally. We look forward to working with the STRAP team to scale and to ensure that visually impaired people can live dignified & independent lives without guides or the white cane.\u201d\n\nAbout STRAP Technologies\n\nSTRAP Technologies mission is to bring increased independence and autonomy to the visually impaired through the development of the world\u2019s first substitute for the white cane. Their featured product, STRAP, is a state-of-the-art wearable device that enables blind and visually impaired people to detect and respond to any type of obstacle and notify them of possible collisions.\n\nThe device is now available for pre-order with a limited promotional price of $500 USD. With a $50 USD deposit now, the remainder is due prior to shipping later this year.\n\nwww.strap.tech\n\nAbout Platform Capital\n\nPlatform Capital is a growth markets focused, sector agnostic, principal investment and advisory firm.

          "title": "FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie Agents Hits 100,000 \u2013 Impacting Hundreds of Thousands of Lives and Communities Across Nigeria.",
          "text": "From FirstBank PR dept.\n\nIf you live in Lagos, Abuja or Port Harcourt, or you reside in any of the other state capitals, you probably take for granted that you actually live in the better of the two worlds that make up Nigeria when it comes to banking. Take Lagos, for example, you would find a bank in almost any corner you turn. You have many streets in business or commercial areas in the city that are lined up by nothing but banks in all their glory and magnificence. If a count is taken, it could be established that there are probably more bank branches in Lagos than any other branded business outlets or branded activity centres \u2013 if street stores and religious centres are excluded.\n\nMany people in city centres somehow assume that this situation of banks being in your face in cities is the same reality that prevails in most parts of the country. They have no idea that there are parts of Nigeria, especially the hinterland, where people take the absence of banks for granted the same way city dwellers take the preponderance of bank branches for granted. To get to the nearest bank, people in the hinterland who live this reality every day would have to travel many kilometres to get to their state capitals or some other large towns. These are the people living in the worse of the two worlds you find in Nigeria as far as having bank presence is concerned.\n\nImagine if the situation were reversed and city dwellers had to travel many kilometres to get to the nearest bank branch where they could do their transactions. It is not unlikely that such a situation would be accompanied by a ballooning of the stress levels in city dwellers, increased road rage on city highways and heightened frustration generally. How would people who spend multiple hours in traffic on a daily basis, work longer than counterparts elsewhere for far less remuneration, enjoy less sleep on their beds and less time with family and loved ones, cope with the additional burden of walking or driving endlessly in search of a bank to do their transactions? How? Just how?\n\nSo city dwellers should indeed be thankful for their world. And while at it, they as well as people in the hinterland, who live in the other world, should not be shy to extend appreciation to those working so hard and tirelessly to bridge the gap between the two worlds in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) financial inclusion initiative geared towards bringing the unbanked and underbanked as well as communities in Nigeria\u2019s hinterland into the formal financial ecosystem has been key to efforts to bridge the gap. The CBN\u2019s mandate to ensure the availability of affordable financial products and services to all individuals and groups of people in Nigeria, regardless of location, literacy level, familiarity with technology or accessibility to modern infrastructural facilities, has been wholly embraced, supported and promoted by FirstBank.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s unmatched commitment to financial inclusion is informed by the bank\u2019s undivided focus on making real impact across Nigeria. Hear Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, the Chief Executive Officer of the premier bank in West Africa and the leading financial inclusion services provider in Nigeria for over 127 years: \u201cThe key strength of our franchise is our ability to look at gaps in the society and develop products and services that [address those gaps].\u201d Continuing, he notes that as an integral part of the bank\u2019s strategy, \u201cWe believe that by significantly working with the Central Bank to improve the financial inclusion index of the country, we would, as FirstBank, be assisting [the] country to address poverty, to address hunger, thereby also promoting security of life and property because when people are gainfully employed, the implication is that they think less of crime.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that FirstBank has driven the financial inclusion initiative much more vigorously than any other bank in Nigeria, with its Firstmonie Agent channel, which crossed the 100,000 Agents mark a few days ago, being among the bank\u2019s many initiatives to expand financial access in the country. The 100,000 Agents feat in itself speaks volumes about the bank\u2019s strides in the financial inclusion space. No other bank comes anywhere close to FirstBank in terms of number and spread of agents in their agent banking networks. FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie Agents and the thousands of staff they employ are in all the 774 local government areas in Nigeria save two and, in 2020 alone, processed over 295 million transactions with a total value of N6.65 trillion and opened more than 196,000 accounts. However, for FirstBank, it is not about number or competition with others or even being the largest bank-led network in Africa, but the impact the Firstmonie Agents channel it is creating, as Dr Adeduntan highlighted above. His deputy, Francis Shobo agrees, saying FirstBank is looking beyond numbers and considering impact. He makes a bold declaration, \u201cWe are trying to make those Agents the centre of the financial ecosystem in the country.\u201d This probably explains why Firstmonie Agents are considered by the bank as community heroes that it is planting all over the nation. And this is the sense one gets in interviews with Agents and customers across the country.\n\nAiyetoro is a riverine community in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State. It has no banks, according to Stephen Adeleye, a Firstmonie Agent serving Aiyetoro community. He recounts how Firstmonie has impacted his community. Adeleye says Firstmonie has provided easy access to banking ensuring that \u201cpeople in the community now have this kind of savings habit\u201d \u2013 a reference to the growing savings culture in Aiyetoro. One of his customers, Tina Farodoye, who operates a grocery store in the community says Firstmonie has helped her business to grow. She can now buy her stock in bulk all the way from Lagos where they are relatively inexpensive (even with transport costs added) compared to her community, all because she is able to transfer funds through Agent Stephen to the wholesalers in Lagos. This has improved her business profitability by increasing the profit margin in her business.\n\nEphraim Osinachi, is a Firstmonie Agent in Obehie, Asa Ukwa West, Abia State. He serves customers across all ages, including the very aged, as all customers are assisted with their transactions, unlike the use of ATM where the customer is practically on their own. He says market traders take advantage of his presence in the community to make lodgements at the end of the day\u2019s trade. He and his staff wait until traders are done at the market (unlike your regular banks which shut their doors to customers at four o\u2019clock, generally). The advantage this offers the people is invaluable. He cites a case where a customer\u2019s house was raided by robbers in their absence and all the robbers could find after ransacking the entire house was fifty naira cash and old phones valued at N3,000. His services are enabling his community to avoid keeping bulk cash at home and the consequent risk of being robbed and traumatised by men of the underworld.\n\nOrode Hesse, Firstmonie Agent in Ubeji, Warri South, Delta State is both emphatic and ecstatic about impact Firstmonie has had on her life. She enthuses that it has really impacted and empowered her financially and enabled her to empower others, especially other women. She has six employees, five of whom are female. So she sees Firstmonie as a business or platform to employ and empower women. Interestingly, Orode is part of the 26 per cent of Firstmonie Agents that are women, a fact that points to the important role Firstmonie is playing in driving women economic empowerment.\n\nAbubakar Aki Bolaji, is a Firstmonie Agent along Karishi Road, Orozo in FCT, Abuja. He points out that the nearest bank to his community is 15km away. He is pleased that his presence as an Agent in the community has cut out the costs of transportation his people would have continued to incur in order to access banking services. His sentiment and delight are shared by the teeming customers he serves. This situation is very common in the North given its landmass and the dispersed nature of human settlements. Dr Adeduntan relates how a senior government official in Jigawa State highlighted how important the presence of Firstmonie Agents was when he informed him that all across a 70km stretch from Gumel, where there was the branch of a bank, there were no banks anywhere in sight. All he saw were at least two Firstmonie Agents in that long stretch of 70km, no banks. Without those two Agents, all the people in the settlements along that 70km stretch would be without access to banking services.\n\nAnother Firstmonie Agent, Mohammed Tatari, serving Tudun Wada in Bununu, Bauchi State, says his services are helping to drive commerce in his community as traders are now able to transfer funds to the wholesalers elsewhere from whom they buy. His services are helping traders to avoid carrying large cash with them given the dire security situation. He noted that the people used to travel elsewhere just to access banking service. His presence has changed all that now. He concludes that Firstmonie is changing his community (for good). One woman who would agree with him is Halima, a housewife and petty trader in the outskirts of Abuja. She discovered Firstmonie through her co-tenant, during the recent lockdown due to COVID-19, and was excited that she could access funds at the Firstmonie Agent outlet close to her and send money to her mother in far away, Maiduguri in Borno State. She had been unable to move to Garki where her bank branch was because of the lockdown.\n\nBesides ensuring that individuals in the suburbs do not have to travel for long hours to the city for their banking activities, Firstmonie Agents are also bridging the gap between the tech-savvy and the low-literacy clients as the Agent network represents the convenient and comfortable alternative for customers that are unacquainted with sophisticated digital channels. And as Firstmonie Agents give their best, FirstBank, on its part, has been doing everything to encourage the Agents. In its inaugural Firstmonie Agent Banking Awards, FirstBank rewarded 37 leading Agents that have promoted financial inclusion in the country. Thirty-one (31) Agents each won the sum of N250,000 at the state level while five Agents won the sum of N1,000,000 at the regional level. At the national level, the grand prize of N2,500,000 was won by Zayyanu Hassan Ishaq, an Agent from Abuja (North Central), who described it as a miracle and noted that it would spur him to work harder.\n\nAs further encouragement and to promote the business activities of Firstmonie Agents, the bank announced the provision of loan facilities of up to N1,000,000 to the Agents. This new credit scheme, which they can access 24 hours a day, can be processed in less than two minutes. The scheme means more empowerment and business expansion for Firstmonie Agents. And the expansion can go beyond Nigeria as Dr Adeduntan says FirstBank is looking beyond Nigeria to other African countries where FirstBank operates, like Ghana and DRC \u2013 a country with over 80 million people \u2013 to promote financial inclusion and begin to address poverty on the African continent through the Firstmonie platform.",

It will be a world standard airport city, sitting on a minimum of 5000 hectares of land, having the airport itself as an anchor project, with complimentary facilities and projects that will enhance the commercial viability of the airport, among other facilities,\u201d Okubadejo said.\n\nSpeaking, the representative of the Group, Dr. Niyi Raji, pointed out that the project was a private sector-driven initiative, to invest and build a three-in-one Compact International Airports, adding that it is a consortium of investors with financial capabilities, expertise in execution and management of various infrastructural projects with proven record of performance.\n\nRaji stated that the project, when fully implemented, would create mass employment opportunities for the residents, cause a paradigm shift in the volume of its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and put the state on the global map.\n\n\u201cThe operations of the Compact three-in-one airports coupled with simultaneous running of both the Metroline and Road network from Ajumo in Ogun State to Ode-Omi in Lagos State would naturally deepen the economic activities of the entrepreneurs and individuals providing services for the facilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe investment will also open up further investments along the oil & gas, food & confectioneries, fashion & entertainment, food & agriculture and automobile workshops, among others.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun State Commissioner for Works and Transportation, Engr. Remi Omowaiye, has said the administration Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is more committed to infrastructural and human capital development in the state, just as he reiterated the administration\u2019s commitment to complete Olaiya Flyover within the stipulated nine months period.\n\nOmowaiye in the company of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Transportation, Engr Toke Olaniyan disclosed this on Monday while speaking with journalists after the inspection of the ongoing Olaiya flyover project.\n\nHe said the pace at which the project is going was highly encouraging, adding that all the necessary material needed have been on ground for the speedy completion of the project.\n\nOmowaiye who was highly elated over speed of the project, said despite the ongoing flyover project, all other road projects across the state are not being affected.\n\nIt would be recalled that Governor Oyetola on February 28, 2021, flagged off the construction of Olaiya flyover in Osogbo.\n\nThe N2.7 billion flyover, handled by Messrs Peculiar Ultimate Concerns Limited, is a 4-span of 15m each, with two Underpass bays for U-turning to Fakunle/Justrite and MDS/Post Office.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWe started this project three months ago, we are in the activity of the fourth month, which means we are going to finish this project under nine months. Work rate here is over 30 percent, which is an indication that we are moving faster than we envisaged.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we do not compromise standards, all regulatory bodies come here often and they see that we don\u2019t compromise standards.\n\n\u201cBefore we started this project, we carried out our environmental impact assessment to look at the impact of the closure of Olaiya on the immediate environment. We kept on reviewing the impact and I can tell you we are able to manage all the challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile we are waiting for piles to cast, we started doing drainage which supposed to be activities of week five but instead of us to wait we started to do drainages.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cWhat is important is not the percentage of construction but the fact that we are running the projects on the site simultaneously. Everything that is needed for the construction is on ground.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed the insinuation that the flyover project is the contractor\u2019s first major project, saying that besides being an indigenous contractor, he has also handled over 100 projects in known states of the country, including bridges.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the contractor handling the project has not done a major project before. It was not only the company that bided, we have two companies. The contractor has done projects in Akwa Ibom, he is doing two in Oyo State and he has done over 100 big contracts in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the contractor is an indigene of Osun, his corporate social responsibility is coming back to the State, besides, he can stand shoulder to shoulder with international contractors in terms of quality service delivery. He is a contractor we can vouch for, we have looked at his pedigree before we consider him.\n\n\u201cThe one he did in Akwa Ibom was done six to seven years ago which was constructed on the water. Our own here is even better, it is standing on a rock\u201d Omowaye added.\n\nSpeaking on the present administration\u2019s commitment to infrastructural development, Omowaiye noted that at the moment, not less than 10 township road projects are ongoing, adding that over 20 major township roads would be commissioned before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have not less than 10 township roads projects ongoing across the state. The flyover project is not even affecting other ongoing projects. Orioke Pure Water road project is ongoing, Lautech /Ajegunle road project, Ona baba Ona road. All these road projects are ongoing.\n\n\u201cKelebe /Iragbiji road almost completed and it\u2019s new road that we just opened up. Ido Osun township road, Kuta Township road, Ife township roads are ongoing. All the roads projects we inherited from the last administration. Iperindo/Ipetu-Ijesa road among others.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over 5 billion naira on the road projects inherited from the last administration. Akoda/Gbongan road, Ada Igbajo road which has reached 90% completion.\n\n\u201cAny moment from now, we are going to award Lawyer Atanda road in Iwo. Aleluya road, Lameco/Okinni/Icon/Ilobu road about 11 KLM road. Modakeke /Famia road has completed before we later approved another 1klm. In Ife north, Ipetu, Moro, Yakoyo road project already completed.\n\n\u201cIla-Orangun road about 10 KLM is undergoing procurement, as a matter of fact, over 20 major road projects will be completed and commissioned before the end of this year,\u201d Omowaiye said.",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: New Policy Fails To Reverse Gas Flaring, Importation",
          "text": "May 3, 2021 568\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.",

          "text": "April 29, 2021 549\n\nPort users, commuters and other motorists are currently groaning over the worsening gridlock on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway and along the Marine Bridge, Ijora, as trailers and tanker drivers have taken over these routes despite the implementation of the electronic call-up system by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock. Under the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\n\nHowever, two months into the implementation of the new system, there seems to be no end in sight to the intractable gridlock with NPA and Lagos State Government appearing helpless as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately on the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some truck drivers, due to the alleged slow process in booking of trucks by the Truck Transit Park (TTP), the company managing the eto application, have abandoned the designated parks to remain on the roads and bridges where they bribe their way into the port with fake e-call up slip in connivance with security personnel deployed to manage the gridlock.\n\nThe action by these truck drivers, coupled with the poor access roads and ongoing construction along the Mile Two-Tin Can Island Port road, has compounded the gridlock as motorists spent several hours trying to get into Apapa yesterday.\n\nAll the major roads into Apapa were completely taken over by trucks and petroleum tankers yesterday. The traffic stretched to other major highways including Eko Bridge and Ikorodu Road.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Directs NSCDC To Collaborate With Other Agencies To Prevent Attacks At Airports\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Stanley Ezenga, said there has not been any respite on the road despite the e-call up system, which he said has become a money-making venture for some people benefiting from the situation.\n\nHe said the traffic situation persists due to poor access roads and the failure of the government to prevail on the contractor handling the construction of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to expedite action.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature. The e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it. For each call up, trucks pay N10,000 but this is just the official money. They still part with other money being given to security operatives before they get to the port.\n\n\u201cSo who is fooling who? From the onset, I know there will be issues with the e-call up because the main issue that has to do with the gridlock coupled with the state of the road has not been addressed. You can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Navy, created a task force but the gridlock has negated all of them. The e-call up is not working. That is why the gridlock is still there. It is the same road the trucks will pass when they are called and when they are not called upon and yet the issues that made them to be on the road have not been addressed.\u201d",

          "title": "The Nigerian Telecom Sector Can Breathe Again",
          "text": "April 29, 2021 435\n\nA week is a week. This is almost true in every part of the world regardless of the season. Every week is also unique. The activities, the happenings, and the stories define each week.\n\n*This week has been epoch-making in every sense. This week, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd. The verdict was unanimous. He was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for over 9mins. George in pleading for his life kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Philonise Floyd, George\u2019s brother said that he\u2019s \u201cable to breathe again\u201d.\n\nThe feeling of relief was widespread. It was a sigh of relief heard around the world. We can all breathe again.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government lifted the ban on sales of SIM cards.\n\nOfficially, it meant that the telcos could resume sales of SIM cards after months of suspension. The sector and indeed Nigerian telecom services consumers were able to breathe again.\n\nDuring the ban, countless people who had lost their phones or damaged their SIM cards couldn\u2019t retrieve them. Visitors to the country couldn\u2019t get SIMs and businesses that depended on SIM card sales suffered. Millions were thrown out of jobs, sales outlets shut down and operators lost revenue. The last five months were a real chokehold on the telecommunications industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Employment Statistics: World Bank, FG To Discuss Modalities Of Data Collection\n\nConservatives reports indicate that the number of connected lines dropped by over 10 million lines. Think, loss in revenue to the telecom services providers and endless pain for the customers who couldn\u2019t connect with family, friends, or business. It was a chokehold.\n\nNo wonder the sector couldn\u2019t breathe. Little wonder the economy recorded a rise in the number of unemployed and more citizens dropped into the poverty zone. The country couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nSince nature abhors a vacuum, it didn\u2019t take long for illegal sales of pre-registered SIMs to gain ground. This is a story for another week.\n\nThe biggest loss was that the objective was lost to all but the initiators. It was a chokehold on the economy, Nigerians couldn\u2019t breathe and nobody knew why.\n\nFirst, a little context. The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, had in December 2020 ordered the suspension of the sales and activation of new SIM cards across all phone networks in the country. Through the NCC, he directed Nigerians to ensure that their phone lines were connected to their National Identification Numbers (NIN) or risk losing the lines.\n\nNow, the suspension was expected, at the time, to last till the completion of the NIN registration. The date fixed was early January.\n\nExperts swore that it was an impossible mission. For in a decade, the NIMC registered less than 50 million people, how can the same organization be reasonably expected to sign on over 50 million people in under six weeks? The experts were right.\n\nSo, it was no surprise therefore that the deadlines had to be shifted repeatedly. The humongous crowd at the registration centres made Nigerians criticised the government for not making adequate provisions before the directive went into effect.\n\nBanning SIM sales precipitated what appears to be several unintended consequences. The number of internet subscribers dropped, no doubt, limiting the chance of meeting the NCC set broadband target.\n\nIn these days of reducing average revenue per user (ARPU), it is a case of declining revenue for the operators.\n\nWhile telcos can\u2019t be expected to complain openly, the impact was an open wound. It was visible for all to see.\n\nThe pain is equally real. Job loss. Revenue loss.\n\nAt a time, when the economy is witnessing diminishing revenues, these losses also mean a reduction in taxes payable to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the government\u2019s actions with its regulations. The situation is typical. The telecommunications industry is making massive contributions to the GDP, yet it was placed in a chokehold and left struggling to breathe.\n\nThankfully, this week, the sector can breathe again.
