          "text": "The Presidential Economic Advisory Council has told the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), that despite exiting recession in Q4 of 2020, the nation\u2019s economy remains fragile.\n\nIt regretted that inflation has continued to rise while unemployment also remained high.\n\nBuhari had in 2019 set up the council chaired by Prof. Doyin Salami to replace the regime\u2019s defunct Economic Management Team led by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nThe council, charged with the responsibility of advising the President on economic policy matters including fiscal analysis, economic growth and a range of internal and global economic issues working with the relevant cabinet members and heads of monetary and fiscal agencies, reports directly to Buhari.\n\nIt made its position known in its presentation at its sixth regular meeting with the President last Friday.\n\nAccording to the document presented at the meeting, a copy of which was obtained by The PUNCH, the council drew Buhari\u2019s attention to the fact that while global economy has continued to improve as COVID-19 infections drop, same cannot be said of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nThe document read, \u201cThe global economy has continued to improve as COVID infections drop and roll-out of vaccination intensifies.\n\n\u201cThough out of recession, the domestic economy remains fragile with inflation continuing to rise, unemployment remains high and external account weak.\n\n\u201cPolicy must urgently address the challenge of rising prices by reducing post-harvest losses and continuing to improve infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe economy exited recession in Q4 \u201820, albeit with very slim growth of 0.1 per cent. Return to growth driven by improvement in some non-oil sectors \u2013including agriculture, solid minerals, ICT and agric sector -and continued growth in the technology sector rather than broad-based growth.\n\n\u201cRising prices of goods and services continues to be a worry. Main drivers of rising prices include disruption to farming activities and inter-state trade as a result of worsening security conditions.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the effect of depreciation in the exchange rate and the residual impact of border closure contributed to higher prices.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the factors above, overall prices rose by 18.17 per cent whilst food prices increased by almost 23 per cent in March 2021 when compared with a year ago.\n\n\u201cOverall unemployment and youth unemployment were recorded at 33.3 per cent and 42.5 per cent at the end of 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to the document, the council is currently working with various stakeholders to understand the dynamics of unemployment in Nigeria.\n\nIt noted that continuing pressure on the Naira at the foreign exchange market suggests that the country\u2019s external trading account remained weak despite the increase in oil prices.\n\nThe council also called on the President to scrutinise the nation\u2019s security funding.\n\nIt said, \u201cFrom the budgetary releases for security, it is either that the resources are not used efficiently and effectively, or that the resources are inadequate, or a combination.\n\n\u201cThe security funding needs detailed scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe council also suggested what it called structural policies to address insecurity.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Imposes nationwide curfew, limits gatherings to 50 persons\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nDisturbed by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Government has announced the reinstitution of all extant control measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the deadly scourge.\n\nAccordingly, the Presidential Steering Committee PSC on COVID-19 has reimposed the nationwide curfew earlier put in place to control the spread of the virus.\n\nIt has also limited gatherings especially in enclosed spaces to a maximum of 50 persons, urging state governments to inaugurate mobile courts to try offenders.\n\nSpeaking at a media briefing Monday in Abuja, Secretary to the Government of the Federation SGF and Chairman of the PSC, Mr Boss Mustapha said the committee has also considered several pre-emptive measures to be taken to mitigate the likely impact of the variants of concern, should they get imported into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the PSC has produced a new Implementation Guidelines being Phase IV of our Eased restrictions of COVID-19 Lockdown in the Country.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cThis step has become compelling in view of the fragile state of our health systems, the disruption to the vaccines delivery and the lack of compliance with the extant public health measures and social measures contained in the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Health Protection Regulations 2021.\n\n\u201cThe PSC has therefore considered it imperative to re-institute the various public health measures that were put in place under the Health Protection Regulations.\n\n\u201cIn taking this step, the PSC requests the State Governments to please step up to play lead roles in the area of enforcement and sanctions. Similarly, our appeal goes to traditional, religious and community leaders to take up more ownership and responsibility for risk communication and community engagement on the virulent nature of the pandemic, concerns over the variants of concern and the need for compliance\u201d, the SGF stated.\n\nHe added that the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government has fixed the cost of COVID-19 testing, whether PCR or otherwise, at $50 (Fifty US Dollars) at all Points of Entry with effect from 17th May 2021.\n\nThe decision, he said, is to ease travel and trade among citizens of ECOWAS States travelling within the region.\n\nPSC\u2019s Head of Technical Secretariat, Dr Mukhtar Mohammed said persons without facemasks will no longer be allowed into government institutions while it directed security agencies to enforce the use of such masks and other non-pharmaceutical interventions in the transportation sector.\n\nMost government meetings are also now held virtually while only essential international travels are encouraged and that all protocols must be adhered to.\n\nMohammed was however emphatic that there are no restrictions on intra-state travels.\n\n\u201cThe PSC continues to reinforce the surveillance system at the country\u2019s points of entry. While our vaccine rollout has begun, there is a shortage in global supplies affected by the current situation in India. This translates to a delay in vaccinating a large proportion of the population and therefore a risk of a large outbreak especially in the context of poor adherence to the recommended public health and social measures.\n\n\u201cThe level of adherence to the use of facemask, physical distancing, temperature checks in public spaces, handwashing and limits on large gatherings remain very poor. In some areas, these are even nonexistent.\n\n\u201cIn line with the increasing risk of a surge in cases, the PSC is therefore maintaining the enforcement of the COVID-19 Health Protection Regulations. This is to mitigate the risk of a spike in new cases while the nationwide vaccine rollout continues.\n\n\u201cFurther to these recommendations and effective from 0001hours of Tuesday, 11th May 2021, this Phase 4 of the phased restriction of movement shall come into effect. We shall maintain restrictions in mass gatherings outside work settings with a maximum number of 50 people in an enclosed space. Approved gatherings must be held with physical distancing measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions in place. Enforcement of a mandatory requirement of a seven-day quarantine for all international passengers arriving from foreign destinations while institutional quarantine for international passengers arriving from the three countries of India, Brazil and Turkey.\n\n\u201cEnforced temperature checks and no mask, no entry policy in all public settings; workplace buildings, businesses and places of worship etc. Access to Government and commercial premises should be denied to persons without facemasks.\n\n\u201cThe nationwide curfew will be imposed tonight at midnight and it will run through till 4 am. No formal restrictions on movement within the country even as citizens are encouraged to refrain from non-essential movements and comply with all non-pharmaceutical interventions and guidelines. People who are above 60 and or with comorbidities are encouraged to stay at home. Only essential international travels are encouraged\u201d, Mohammed added.\n\nHe said while hotels are to remain open, they should adhere to all non-pharmaceutical interventions while schools are to deploy the use of antigen-based rapid tests as recommended in the guidelines by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control NCDC.\n\nMohammed added that all indoor recreational facilities and gyms are to close until 11th June 2021 when the situation will be reviewed. \u201cHowever, non-contact outdoor sports such as gulf, Polo, tennis etc are not affected\u201d.\n\n\u200bThe PSC said it has received reports of some returning foreign passengers who violated the mandatory quarantine requirement under the advisory by escaping from the facilities.\n\n\u201cWe deprecate such violation of the laws of our land and our hospitality. The PSC is awaiting the report of ongoing investigations and we wish to assure Nigerians that appropriate sanctions would be imposed on the violators\u201d, said Mustapha.\n\nHe said closely associated with the control measures is the issue of vaccine access and administration.\n\nAccording to him, given the challenge of vaccine nationalism compounded by the production situation in India, the PSC is exploring other options to get Nigerians vaccinated.\n\n\u201cAs of date, 1,690,719 persons have received their first dose of the vaccine in Nigeria representing 84% of the targeted persons for this phase. We appeal to States, especially those high burden areas, to push ahead with the vaccination programme\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

I don\u2019t see what is wrong in that. As the Minister of Transportation for four years, I hardly know what is happening and I want to know now.\n\n\u201cThe president agrees with me that it\u2019s my responsibility as minister to find out what is going on\n\n\u201cIt worries me that people are saying we should not ask questions. Nobody has been indicted.\n\n\u201cCan we know what is going on in NPA? That\u2019s the question.\n\n\u201cIf everything is right, why do we have to bother at the end of the day?\n\n\u201cWhen you have completed your assignment, we will be glad to pass on the report to the President, but don\u2019t forget your assignment will include activities of procurement and its processes from 2016 till date.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why you do not have a time limit. So, it will take you some time. You are not auditing, but finding out the processes.\n\n\u201cPlease be diligent, invite anybody you want to invite, including the minister, if there are infractions you need me to clarify,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Amaechi, NPA is an agency that manages maritime trading activities in Nigeria which is expected to generate huge resources for the government to run the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: Army debunks alleged deployment of only Northern officers to Southeast\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of State (Transportation), Senator Gbemisola Saraki said the investigation was within the purview of the ministry.\n\n\u201cThis is why the ministry supervises and part of that role is looking, asking questions, and ensuring that things are done with due process.\n\n\u201cFor the panel, there is so much noise, so it\u2019s best you block your ears. Keep your head down and do what is in the interest of the entire country,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nResponding, Chairman of the committee, Suleiman Auwalu, who doubles as Director of Maritime Services of the ministry pledged the commitment of other members to diligently carry out the duties assigned to them.\n\n\u201cI assure you that we are going to work; we are going, to be honest, and fair in the discharge of this responsibility.\n\n\u201dAt the end of the day, we want to turn up a report that will be true and it will be in the interest of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, we are seeking God\u2019s guidance for us to do the right thing at the right time,\u201d Auwalu said.\n\nThe 11-man committee is made up of five directors from the Ministry while the remaining six, including the co-chairman, Ben Omogo, are drawn from the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.\n\nIt would be recalled that President Buhari last week, directed Hadiza Bala-Usman to step aside for the entire duration of the Investigation while directing Mohammed Koko (Director, Finance and Administration of NPA) to step in an acting capacity.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Bandits are gradually leading the country into a tailspin and the president seems to have been bereft of ideas.\n\n\u201cWhat we experience daily now in Nigeria is enough to set the country on fire; a section of the country lording itself over other sections.\n\nYet they said we shouldn\u2019t talk, that our calls for O\u2019odua Republic were done in bad faith. How can you explain the killings, kidnappings and banditry spreading in North, East, West and South?\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest problems of this government is nepotism. One begins to wonder why Mr. President is insensitive to the plights of others, especially, to the sorrow and agony of citizens losing loved ones to bloodshed. In sane climes, love transcends ethnic, racial or political boundaries. You must blink with pain to see people die or university students being killed amounts to cold-hearted indifference.\n\n\u201cIt is a wakeup call for President Buhari to address all these issues in the interest of this country; else God will not forgive him if Nigeria disintegrates through war,\u201d he said.\n\nAPC has lost the will to secure Nigerians, says PDP treasurer\n\nMeanwhile, speaking at a different forum, the PDP treasurer, Mr. Aribisala said the APC has completely lost the will to ensure the security of lives and property of the citizens.\n\nAribisala spoke at the weekend in Ado-Ekiti, while unveiling his campaign organisation team which has a former chairman of the party in the state, Mr. Bola Olu-Ojo as the Director-General.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, we cannot travel without feeling apprehension of being kidnapped, that\u2019s how bad our security setup is. The president and his team have completely lost it.\n\n\u201cThey lied to Nigerians and we can see the damage they have done to our country across all sectors. There is poverty in the land and there is no hope because the federal government is not doing anything tangible to savage the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we need now are people with good ideology, with quality leadership, who could use their knowledge to revamp the economy, ensure security and bring succor to the people.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the National President of the Apostolic Church, Nigeria, Apostle Sampson Igwe, has advised Nigerians not to allow themselves to be lured by politicians with food items like rice, stockfish and other material gifts.\n\nIgwe stressed that Nigerians must look for people of integrity who are committed to render selfless service for the good and progress of the country, noting that politicians who lure voters with gifts always forget them when they get to power.\n\nHe made the assertion while addressing a media briefing this weekend at the Apostolic Church headquarters Auditorium, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State as part of activities marking the presidential tour of the state territory.\n\nHis words, \u201cMany times we have made mistakes to elect politicians who come with rice and stockfish, and when they give you Rice and stockfish, they won\u2019t remember you again. I think we have to be careful.\n\n\u201cWe need to look for leaders who are God-fearing, who will not come and lure you. But because of poverty, we are interested in the rice and stockfish that we eat for a day and in the remaining years, we will be suffering.\n\n\u201cIn 2023 we should decide in our hearts to reject this stockfish and rice and look for men of integrity, men who fear God, and who are righteous. Can you imagine that we conducted an election in 2019, and what we hear now is 2023 and when 2023 passes, we shall be hearing about 2027? Is that what we come here to do?\u201d\n\nALSO READ: One cop shot as unknown gunmen attack another police station in Abia\n\nThe cleric who decried the worsening insecurity in the country, however, expressed the hope that Nigerians would soon get over the challenge.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to be security conscious, adding, \u201cInsecurity will end, but we have to play our own roles, we have to sit down as security men and women. Security men are not everywhere, neither are they gods; they act on Information that is given to them.\n\n\u201cLook at the situation where over 100 hoodlums will enter into a village and kidnap up to 300 students and carry them away and nobody sees them again\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

One will least expect such a person to make such an unkind and ungodly statement,\u201d Bamgbose told DAILY POST.\n\n\u201cHe has really disappointed the Yoruba race. He went ahead to curse those who won\u2019t support the Oduduwa Republic.\n\n\u201cLet him, however, be authoritatively informed that there will be grave consequences for insulting a man of God.\n\n\u201cThe Bible makes it clear, touch not my anointed, do my prophet no harm, it\u2019s a fearful thing to fall in the hands of God, for God is a consuming fire.\n\n\u201cSunday Igboho should expect God\u2019s reaction in the next 30 days.

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nThe surge and violence of infections of the new variant resulting in mass deaths in India, among others, are the reasons the Federal Government re-introduced COVID-19 restrictions, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha said yesterday.\n\nHe explained that the government was being pro-active to prevent a third wave of the virus in the country.\n\nMustapha added: \u201cThis step has become compelling in view of the fragile state of our health systems, the disruption to the vaccines delivery and the lack of compliance with the extant public health measures and social measures contained in the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Health Protection Regulations 2021.\n\n\u201cIn taking this step, the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) requests the state governments to please step up to play lead roles in the area of enforcement and sanctions.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to traditional, religious and community leaders to take up more ownership and responsibility for risk communication and community engagement on the virulent nature of the pandemic, concerns over the variants of concern and the need for compliance.\n\nThe new restriction measures announced by PSC incident manager Dr. Mukhtar Mohammed that took immediate effect including:\n\nNationwide curfew from 12:00am to 4am\n\nRestrictions on mass gathering to a maximum of 50 people in an enclosed place\n\nRestriction on resumption of workers from GL 12 and below\n\nClosure of event centres, bars and night clubs\n\nRestaurants to provide eat-ins at 50% capacity\n\nPeople 60 years and above or with ailment advised to stay at home or avoid crowds\n\nDr. Mohammed said military personnel are to monitor and enforce adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions on public transport, that is wearing face masks and maintaining social distance.\n\nHe expressed concerns over the shortage of vaccines for the larger population of Nigerians and the delay it would impose on the national rollout programme.\n\nHe said the situation was caused by the escalation of the dangerous strain of the virus in India, one of the largest producers of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cWhile our vaccine rollout has begun, there is a shortage in global supplies, affected by the current situation in India. This translates to a delay in vaccinating a large proportion of the population and therefore a risk of a large outbreak, especially in the context of poor adherence to the recommended public health and social measures.\n\nThe SGF recalled that the PSC had issued a Travel Advisory which, he said, took into consideration, the utility of travel restrictions, outcomes of epidemiological risk assessment, factors that aid transmission as well as control measures that could be deployed.\n\nHe noted that in the Advisory, additional requirements were placed on passengers from India, Turkey and Brazil.\n\nMustapha regretted that there have been reports of some returning foreign passengers who violated the mandatory quarantine requirement under the advisory by escaping from the facilities.\n\n\u201cWe deprecate such violation of the laws of our land and our hospitality. The PSC is awaiting the report of on-going investigations and we wish to assure Nigerians that appropriate sanctions would be imposed on the violators,\u201d he assured.\n\nHe remarked that given the challenge of vaccine nationalism compounded by the production situation in India, the PSC is exploring other options to get Nigerians vaccinated.\n\nThe SGF reaffirmed that 1,690,719 persons had received their first dose of the vaccine, representing 84% of the targeted persons for this phase.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe appealed to states, especially those high burden areas, to push ahead with the vaccination programme.\n\nMustapha said the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government had fixed the cost of COVID-19 testing, whether PCR or otherwise, at $50 (Fifty US Dollars) at all Points of Entry with effect from 17th May, 2021.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor\n\nLagos State government yesterday unfolded plans to further regulate the activities of commercial motorcyclists in a bid to enhance security in the state.\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who decried the display of lawlessness and criminality by the Okada riders, said he would announce further changes to their operations in certain areas of the metropolis.\n\nThe new measures, he said, followed pleas by Lagosians to the state government to take decisive actions on some trends that have posed insecurity to the state.\n\nMany people have demanded action to curb the menace of commercial motorcycles, kidnapping, armed robbery, cult clashes and violent assault.\n\nIt was at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on Security held at the Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja where the governor and leading lights in security circles listened to a group of panelists who highlighted the state\u2019s security challenges.\n\nIn the audience were religious leaders, the Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, military chiefs, traditional leaders, community leaders, students, unionists and members of the State Executive Council.\n\nSanwo-Olu listed his administration\u2019s efforts in security and assured his audience that a decisive action would be taken on commercial motorcycles, which speaker after speaker described as a getaway means for criminals.\n\nIts operators, they said, are unruly, uncouth, rude and brutal.\n\nBut those who patronise them and the motorcyclists will not be left in the cold. The government, Sanwo-Olu said, will be inaugurating next week the first and last mile buses, which will ply the routes the motorcycles are plying.\n\nBesides, those who have taken up Okada riding for lack of jobs to grab the opportunities in agriculture, wealth creation, poverty alleviation and other government programmes.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the meeting was convened in response to the growing threat posed by their lawless activities to the safety and security of lives in the state.\n\nThe governor said the string of lawlessness daily witnessed from the confrontation between commercial motorcyclists and law enforcement agencies required an urgent action, stressing that government would be announcing reforms in transportation, which will further make changes to the parameters of motorcycle and tricycle operators.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have noted with dismay the fact that Okada riders are disregarding and flouting the restrictions we imposed on their activities in certain areas of the metropolis. We have also observed with dismay, the ongoing violent confrontation by commercial motorcyclists against our law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cBased on all that we have seen and experienced in the past couple of weeks, as well as the increasing threat posed by the activities of commercial motorcycle operators to the safety and security of lives, we will be announcing further changes to the parameters of motorcycle and tricycle operations in the state in the coming days. No society can make progress amid such haughty display of lawlessness and criminality.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said the state government would be unveiling 500 units of First and Last Mile mini buses next week as safer alternative means of transportation in checkmating activities of Okada riders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor also government would fully implement the state\u2019s Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law of 2019 as amended, which will enable it take over and demolish abandoned buildings and construction sites turned into safe haven for hoodlums and miscreants.\n\nHe added that the state would strengthen its clean-up exercise of shanties and spots unapproved for settlement, but which had turned to hideouts for criminals.\n\nThe government, Sanwo-Olu said, would be recruiting more personnel into the Lagos State Neighbourhood Corps (LSNC) to boost intelligence gathering at the community level.\n\nThe governor said the consultative meeting with the stakeholders was necessary to make security strategy effective and sustainable, noting that all hands must be on deck to work with the government in collecting, sharing and evaluating credible intelligence that would strengthen security of lives and property in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cLagos must continue to enjoy an atmosphere of peace, safety and all-encompassing security. We are determined to arrest the current security challenges being faced in the state, and we will take every step necessary to deliver on our promises on a safe, secure and livable state. We will also continue to communicate regularly with key stakeholders, and all the residents for updates on the progress we are making.\u201d\n\nAppraising security situation in Lagos, Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, raised the alarm over rising security breaches resulting from the menace of Okada operations.\n\nBetween January and early this month, Odumosu disclosed, 320 commercial motorcycles were arrested in 218 cases of criminal incidents in which 78 suspects were detained and 480 ammunition recovered.\n\nIn the same period, the Lagos police boss said Okada accounted for 83 per cent of 385 cases of avoidable fatal vehicular accidents in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe menace of Okada operators does not end with avoidable accidents. Crime reports from the field have shown that a greater percentage of crimes, ranging from armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, murder, burglary and stealing, traffic robbery to carjacking and cash snatching from bank customers, are attributable to armed hoodlums who operate on Okada.\n\n\u201cThe nuisance constituted by the Okada operators on Lagos roads has become a danger to law-abiding citizens. Sections of Lagos populace have come to regard commercial motorcycles as a necessary evil, it has become imperative for government to take more drastic measures against their notoriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State Police Command strongly advises the state government to immediately review the current guidelines guiding the operation of Okada as a means of commercial transportation in the state and take decisive legal and administrative steps and policies that will curb their traffic, criminal and other nefarious activities in the state.\u201d\n\nThere was a panel of discussion chaired by an award-winning Television Show host, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, in which residents aired their views on the current state of security in Lagos and across the country.\n\nThe discussants expressed concerns on the security implications of allowing operations of Okada and demanded a \u2018Special Status\u2019 for Lagos as ethnic melting pot. They also urged the government to create economic opportunities and vocational engagement for unemployed residents to further lessen crime rates.\n\nAddressing the complaints about criminals hiding in uncompleted buildings and abandoned vehicles within communities, Vice Chairman of Lagos State Community Development Advisory Council, Mr. Rotimi Ayoku-Owolawi, said the CDC was ready to support the government and the police in identifying dark spots and lock-up markets from where criminals launch their nefarious activities.\n\nCommissioner for Information Mr. Gbenga Omotoso described the stakeholders\u2019 engagement as proactive, given a string of security breaches in the country.\n\nHe said gone were the days when citizens were at the mercy of pick-pockets and amateur criminals. The contemporary crimes, he said, are being committed by armed robbers, blood-sucking bandits and dare-devil gangsters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our Lagos to become an epicenter of evil and criminality,\u201d Omotoso said.\n\nAt the end of the stakeholders\u2019 meeting, a 12-point resolution was reached and agreed upon by the participants in public interest.\n\nThe resolution reads in part: \u201cAttacks on law enforcement officers and agencies should not be handled with kid gloves. Culprits must be arrested and the full weight of the law brought to bear on such persons.\n\n\u201cThe government must take stringent measures to ban the use of Okada as means of transportation in the state; alternatives must be provided by the state government in agriculture, wealth creation, women empowerment programmes and others.\n\n\u201cGovernment should take control of abandoned and uncompleted buildings used as hideouts of criminals in the state immediately. The state must take control of abandoned vehicles in its nooks and crannies and seal off houses, hotels and event centres where hoodlums are found to hibernate or where arms are stored.\u201d",

          "text": "By Frank Ikpefan and Tony Akowe, Abuja\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArewa Consultative Forum and Northern Elders Forum yesterday disagreed over the demand for President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s impeachment or resignation.\n\nNorthern Elders said the President should vacate office, following rising insecurity, which has led to the killing of innocent Nigerians in different parts of the country.\n\nNEF asked the National Assembly to impeach President Buhari, if he is unable to secure Nigerians.\n\nIts spokesman, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, who spoke on the Africa Independent Television (AIT), said the country cannot wait two more years for Buhari to address the issues of insecurity.\n\nBaba-Ahmed spoke few days after the presidency said some leaders were pushing for regime change.\n\nBaba-Ahmed said: \u201cOne option we have is that the legislators will look at the record of the administration, understand the areas where the president has failed, understand areas where there is clearly no evidence that they\u2019re going to do anything about it and refer to the constitution that says the whole purpose of government is to secure citizens and pursue their welfare.\n\n\u201cIf Buhari fails to do that, for me, those are impeachable offences. In the last six months, two years, what has the president done to secure the country? Absolutely nothing has been done and yet you see increasing failure of the state to protect citizens.\n\n\u201cOr as our democratic system provides, those with the responsibility to get them off, should impeach those who are failing. If the president can\u2019t deliver, he should be impeached.\u201d\n\nBut former ACF Secretary General Anthony Sani and Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) dismissed calls by the NEF, saying that it lacked justification.\n\nSani said that the Elders Forum was merely playing the card of the opposition in the National Assembly who last week called for the impeachment of the President.\n\nSani said: \u201cI think the Northern Elders Forum is pandering to the calls by the opposition in the National Assembly that the President should be impeached for failing to put an end to the insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cWhile one cannot question the right of opposition to call for the impeachment of the President if he has committed impeachable offenses, it is important to note that impeachment arises from specific breaches of the constitution, and not from declaratory assertions.\n\n\u201cYes, insecurity is a cause for concern. Most Nigerians would wish the government could put an end to the prevalent insecurity across the country. But it cannot be the basis of impeachment precisely because this regime inherited the insecurity posed by the insurgence which attacks transcended the North.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe letter and spirit for impeachment are for improvement in the quality and volume of good governance for the good of all.But the application of the provisions are for specific breaches of the constitution which the proponents of impeachment must articulate and provide for effect. Impeachment is not an instrument for the use of opposition any time they are not satisfied or have grouses with the government.It is a serious matter.\n\n\u201cLook at how America which has experienced over 150 mass shootings for the past four months is debating how to mitigate it.Nobody is talking of impeachment but how to end or reduce mass shooting.\n\n\u201cWe better come together and unleash our synergistic potential against collective challenges for the good of all.\u201d\n\nBMO described those calling for the President\u2019s impeachment as anarchists\u2019\n\nIts Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, said this was not the time to call for resignation or impeachment of the President, but a time to support and encourage him to do he is doing to address the security challenges in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know that at this point in time, all hands are supposed to be on deck. So, anybody that is asking for the impeachment of the President is just being an anarchist. The contest of our challenges regarding insecurity is just a surging issue.\n\n\u201cIt is not as if the government is overwhelmed or as if this issue has been with us forever. In 2015, the President inherited issues of insecurity in the north. Between 2016 a d 2017, he was able to curtail them. But sometimes late last year, this started.\n\n\u201cSo, it is a new phase of the security challenges that the President is contending with. So, the President has also shown capacity, seriousness and commitment and is mobilizing his men in the Armed Forces and the Police and has continued to assure Nigerians that this will be curtailed.\n\n\u201cIt is only those who wants to dance on the blood of the innocent that will use this opportunity to explore the sentiments of innocent Nigerians. This is not the time to ask for resignation or impeachment. This is the time to encourage the President to continue to do what he is doing.\n\n\u201cAs a person and a collective of those who supports the President, we are behind him, we are encouraging him to do all he can because we know that he has the capacity. He has shown it in the north east and we know that he will curtail this new security challenges\u201d.",

This include, the use of Okada as a veritable tool to commit crime and get away with it by hoodlums; disrespect to traffic rules and regulations; the Okada operators becoming nuisance and reckless on our roads, resulting into avoidable accidents with attendant consequences on human life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was attended by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, security chiefs and members of the public.\n\nMeanwhile, Lagosians have asked the state government to take decisive actions on some security issues to rein in what they describe as a disturbing trend.\n\nAmong others, they demanded action against the menace of commercial motorcycles, otherwise known as Okada, kidnapping, armed robbery, cult clashes, and violent assaults.\n\nThey made the call at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on security held, yesterday, at the Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja, with governor Sanwo-Olu and other leading lights in attendance.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu listed his administration\u2019s efforts in security and assured his audience that a decisive action would be taken on commercial motorcycles.\n\nHe said the meeting was convened in response to the growing threat posed by some lawless activities to the safety and security of lives in the State.",

          "text": "From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has raised the alarm over the \u2018shoot-on-sight\u2019 order given to soldiers against dissenting Igbo youths, warning it was an order for another pogrom and genocide.\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze, Prof. George Obiozor, in a statement, yesterday, admonished the Federal Government to refrain from the use of force in resolving national crisis.\n\nHe also flayed the government for the pattern of deployment of northern military officers to the South-East saying it lends credence to the report of the shoot-on-sight order. In a statement issued yesterday in Enugu on his behalf by the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Alex Ogbonnia, the Ohanaeze President tasked the Federal Government to \u201clearn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism, but seek possible peaceful options that are the only solution that guarantees national unity and peaceful coexistence.\u201d\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cThe attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has been drawn to the shoot-on-sight order given to Nigerian soldiers on how to engage Igbo youths in the oncoming week. The Sahara Reporters, May 8, elaborated on the new secret plan which by the grace of God has come to the public domain. The report further revealed that the exercise will commence from Orlu in Imo State, South East Nigeria. This is very disturbing.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of deployment of northern military officers to the South-East lends credence to the above report. Sahara Reporters revealed that in preparation for the above, the Nigerian army has posted northern Muslims as commanders over its operations and brigades in Anambra, Imo, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Benue, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra State, the Cantonment Commandant of the 302 Artillery Regiment, Onitsha, is Col. Abdulsalam Abubakar Sambo, a Hausa-Fulani Muslim; while in Imo State, the Brigade Commander of 34 Brigade, Obinze, is Brig. Gen Ibrahim Tukura, another northerner; in Abia State, the Brigade Commander of 14 Brigade, Ohafia, is Brig. Gen M. Ibrahim, still, a northerner; while in Akwa Ibom, the Brigade Commander of 2 Brigade, Uyo, is Brig. Gen Faruk Mijinyawa, another northerner. This is truly worrisome.\u201d\n\nInsisting that the current problems confronting Nigeria, such as ethnic militia, agitation for secession, insurgency, were a product of sustained orchestrated injustice in governance, Obiozor lamented that \u201csub-national consciousness or ethnocentric nationalism which is a dangerous form of nationalism to national unity has taken over Nigeria. The dream of Nigeria unity is receding and fading fast with violence, crises and conflicts.\u201d\n\nIt also made reference to former senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, who decried that Igbo have been systematically marginalised since the civil war.\n\n\u201cSpeaking in Kaduna at a meeting organised by the Association of Eze-Ndigbo in the Diaspora on Saturday, May 8, 2021, Sani described the marginalisation as a \u2018collective punishment\u201d\u2019saying \u2018there has been a systemic exclusion and marginalisation of your people, stemming from the historical Biafra war. This is a collective punishment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the army headquarters in Abuja has debunked reports that it was only officers of northern extraction that were posted to the South East. Director Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen Mohammed Yerima, who made this known said there was no truth in the report. by an online publication over the allegation. Yerima in a statement said the report was aimed at steering bad blood among peace loving Nigerians who have refused to support the senseless and brutal attacks on security personnel and structures in the South East.\n\nHe said the army being a national body does not promote or post its personnel along ethnic or religious lines and that postings are routine exercises and are based on professional competences.\n\n\u201cFor the records, let be clear in everyone\u2019s mind that the army does not train, deploy or operate along ethnic, religious, tribal or regional divides. Senior officers are posted to command units based on their capability and competence taking into consideration their posting history.\u201d",

          "title": "How $1.5bn Channel Management, INTELS Contracts Pitted Amaechi against Bala-Usman",
          "text": "By Eromosele Abiodun\n\nLast week\u2019s suspension of Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, at the request of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, was the culmination of a two-year war of attrition between the duo, triggered by disagreement in 2019 over whether or not to renew the channel management contracts, THISDAY findings have shown.\n\nIt was learnt that the NPA had in 2019 placed advertisement in newspapers calling for expression of interest and bids.\n\nSources said three bid rounds were cancelled on the orders of the minister over disagreements on the selective bids and open bids.\n\nThe process was suspended till May 11, 2020, when the NPA placed advertisements calling for expression of interest, which was again moved to October 2020 because participants protested that they could not participate because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe channels in contention are: Lagos, Port Harcourt (Bonny) and Warri while Calabar is under litigation.\n\nEach channel management contract is valued at $100 million a year for five years making it $1.5 billion (N600 billion) for the three channels for the five years.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Amaechi had requested that two Chinese companies are selected to manage Bonny and Warri Channels, a request the NPA rejected because it violated due process.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that 12 companies submitted technical bids for Lagos Channel, 25 companies for Warri while 18 companies bid for Bonny.\n\nAt the end of the technical bid process, three companies were shortlisted for Bonny and Warri while two were selected for Lagos.\n\nFor the Warri Channel, Pelfaco Construction Nigeria Limited, Redstar and China Harbour (JV) and A.A Ranno were prequalified.\n\nFor Bonny, Bellsea Limited, CRBC and CDBHC Limited (JV) and Borno Energy Limited/Dact Energy (JV) were prequalified.\n\nJandnul Limited and Hankuff Services Nigeria Limited were prequalified for the Lagos Channel.\n\nThe companies prequalified submitted their commercial bids between January and February.\n\nCompetent sources at the Bureau of Public Procurement told THISDAY that three company\u2019s commercial bids were accepted as winners.\n\nThey are: Redstar Limited for Warri, Bellsea Limited for Bonny and Hancuff Services Limited for Lagos.\n\nThe battle between Amaechi and Bala-Usman further heightened this year when Amaechi wrote a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari requesting that INTELS Pilotage contract, which expired last year, be restored.\n\nIn a letter to Buhari in January 2021, Amaechi requested the restoration of all contracts between NPA and INTELS, which according to him, are now subject to legal disputes between the parties.\n\nThe minister also requested the withdrawal of all matters currently in court or at arbitration by both parties in order to enable him to resolve all pending issues \u2018administratively,\u201d a request that was granted by the president on January 22, 2021.\n\nHowever, following a request by the presidency, Bala-Usman, in a letter to the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari dated January 25, 2021, explained that the INTELS pilotage contract was not cancelled but had expired.\n\nShe also clarified that the NPA, contrary to claims, still have three contracts with INTELS, which include, the concession agreement for Onne Terminal A and B in Rivers State-commenced in 2005 and ending in 2030; the concession agreement for Calabar Terminal A in Calabar Port, Rivers State and concession for Warri New and Old Terminal, Delta Port, Delta State.\n\nBala-Usman, in the letter, stated: \u201cThe Service Boat Operation Management Agent contract commenced in June 2007 with a review of an extension of 10 years in 2011 to culminate in August 2020. The authority had in 2017 served INTELS with a notice of termination for its refusal to comply with the TSA policy of the federal government.\n\n\u201cFollowing the receipt of the notice, the company complied with the policy and a supplemental agreement was signed to recognise the compliance to TSA and the notice of termination was accordingly withdrawn.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the agreement with INTELS on this service was not terminated but it reached the end of its contractual period in August 2020. In compliance with the Public Procurement Act (PPA), the authority in December 2019 initiated a public tender process in anticipation of the expiration of the contract for the appointment of a contractor to provide the authority with that service.\u201d\n\nShe added that INTELS along with other bidders submitted their bids to qualify for the tender but that INTELS violated one of the criteria advertised for the tender and was disqualified.\n\nWhile this was ongoing, Amaechi wrote another letter to Buhari alleging a shortfall in operating surpluses by the NPA requesting that she be suspended.\n\nThis move, THISDAY learnt, was against the advice of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) who warned against the request in a letter to Amaechi.\n\nThe AuGF, in a letter dated April 16, 2021, had pointed out that NPA\u2019s account for the period, except 2019, which is awaiting NPA\u2019s board approval, had been audited and available.\n\nThe AuGF, Mr. Aghughu Adolphus, in the letter personally signed, said: \u201cI write to respond to your letter reference number FMOT/F&A/ AuGF/2017/4/T dated April 6, 2021, especially with particular reference to paragraph two of the letter and wish to state the position of the AuGF with regards to your request. With particular reference to paragraph 20, \u201cAnnual Estimates and audit,\u201d the Act number 38 of 1999 establishing the NPA and Sec. 85 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), I humbly advise as follows: \u201cThe board shall cause to be kept proper accounts of the authority and proper records, in relation thereto and when certified by the board, the accounts shall be audited by auditors appointed by the authority from the list and in accordance with the guidelines supplied by the AuGF.\n\n\u201cNothing in sub-sec, two of this section shall be construed as authorising the AuGF to audit the accounts of or appoint auditors for government statutory corporations, commissions, authorities, agencies, including all persons and bodies established by an act of the National Assembly, but the Auditor General shall: A. provide such bodies with: 1. A list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors and from which the bodies shall appoint their external auditors, and 2. Guidelines on the level of fees to be paid to external auditors and B. Comment on their accounts and auditors reports thereon.\n\n\u201cIn line with I and 2 above, I wish to state that: The NPA board has duly engaged the external audit firms- Messrs Muhtari Dangama & Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants. The said audit firms audited and published the audited accounts of NPA duly approved by the board for the years ended: December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe AuGF added that the audit of 2019 by Messrs Muhtari Dangama & Co and SIAO Chartered Accountants was ongoing and awaiting NPA board\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlso, my office has conducted periodic checks for the years 2016-2018, and issued periodic checks reports along with comments on their annual accounts and auditor\u2019s reports thereon, and reputable professional audit firms are already being engaged by the NPA board in line with the enabling Act \u2013 hence no justification for the Ministry \u201cto advertise and select qualified Audit firms to conduct the exercise. Please be guided by the quoted provisions and accept the assurance of my warm regards.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that Amaechi\u2019s desire to have HLS International Limited, an Israeli handling the $195 million maritime security contract, take over the disputed Secure Anchorage Area (SAA) that was turned down was another bone of contention.\n\nThe federal government had in 2017 approved a $195 million maritime security contract with an Israeli firm, HLS International Limited under the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure also called the Deep Blue Project.\n\nBut in a move that negates the anti-corruption posture of the Buhari administration, Amaechi wrote to the government to ask for another $22.99 million to hire fast intervention vessels to check insecurity in Nigeria\u2019s waters.\n\nIn a memo to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) dated July 22, 2020, Amaechi sought the government\u2019s approval for the renewal of lease of fast intervention security vessels for a period of one year, claiming the $195 million already approved for the same purpose had been put on hold due to COVID-19.\n\nThe memo reads in part, \u201cThe purpose of this memorandum is to seek the consideration of the FEC for the extension of the contract for the lease of 6 no. units of fast intervention security vessels (FISV) on the same terms and conditions as earlier approved by the FEC in 2018 in favour of the following 6 no. service provider: Pearl HPW Limited, Thamson Energy services Limited, Fairway Offshore Limited, Aquashiled Oil & Marine Services Limited, XPO Marine Services Limited and Peace Marine and Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cCouncil is invited to recall that at its EC(2018)40 meeting held on Wednesday, 5 December 2018, it considered and granted approval for the renewal of the contract for the lease of six fast intervention security vessels for a period of one year, at the reviewed daily rate of $10,500 per vessel-making a total sum of $22.995, 000.00 on an annual basis which is equivalent to N7,013,475, 000.00, at the exchange rate of $1.00 to N305.00, inclusive of all taxes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abdulsalami debunks alleged link with terrorists\n\nBy Francis Sardauna in Katsina and Dipo Laleye in Minna\n\nThere was outrage among residents of Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State yesterday as bandits abducted 45 worshippers observing the midnight prayer for Ramadan at Angwan Kwata Mosque in the area.\n\nThe marauding bandits, according to residents, stormed the mosque at 1 am and whisked away the victims to an unknown destination.\n\nBut the police said they had rescued 35 of the victims while 10 were still with the bandits.\n\nThe incidence occurred as a former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, debunked alleged link with terrorists and bandits.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited Angwan Kwata yesterday, it was gathered that the bandits, during the raid on the mosque, directed the Imam to end the prayer session before kidnapping the people.\n\nHowever, residents slammed security agencies and the state government, saying the abduction of the congregants raised questions about the capacity of the government and security agents to tackle banditry and other forms of insecurity.\n\nThe residents, in separate interviews with THISDAY, accused the security agencies of culpability in the unending banditry and kidnapping in the area, saying security agencies don\u2019t respond to distress calls.\n\nA community leader in the area, who craved anonymity, said: \u201cThe bandits abducted 45 worshippers and injured many others. Some of the victims are in Jibia General Hospital now receiving treatment.\u201d\n\nHe accused the state government and security agencies of failing to secure the lives and property of the people.\n\nZaharadeen Umar, whose younger sister, Halimatu, was among those kidnapped, told THISDAY that the bandits kidnapped no fewer than 45 worshippers and injured two others who were trying to escape.\n\nUmar said: \u201cThis morning (Monday) at 1 am, we were praying inside the mosque when bandits came and started shouting that \u2018every everybody should stand, whoever runs will be killed.\u2019 I saw a young boy that is not up to my younger brother\u2019s age with AK-47.\n\n\u201cThey kidnapped our brothers, wives, and younger ones, including my 20-year-old younger sister, Halimatu. From our findings, the bandits kidnapped 45 people in the mosque. None of the security personnel came to our rescue during the attack till after one hour before they came.\u201d\n\nHe debunked the police report that they rescued some of the kidnapped victims, saying all the victims are still in captivity.\n\nHe, however, said efforts were being made by some residents in synergy with a vigilante group to rescue the abductees.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe police did not come to this place until 2 am when all the bandits had left with our people. When they came, they entered the mosque and packed the shoes of those kidnapped, and took them to their office. So, they did not even rescue a chicken from this place.\u201d\n\nAnother worshipper, who survived the attack but sustained injuries on his head and left hand, Muhammadu Bello, said the bandits operated for more than two hours.\n\nHe, however, could not ascertain the number of kidnapped victims because he fled the scene.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe bandits met us in the mosque and asked us to follow them but I told them I will not follow them. So, one of them hit me with his gun on my head. One of them also injured me with something on my left hand; so, I started running to town.\u201d\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the abduction of the 45 worshippers in a telephone interview with THISDAY.\n\nBut he said the police, in synergy with other security agencies, had rescued 35 of them.\n\nAccording to him, efforts are being made to rescue the remaining victims.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, there was an attack on a Jibia mosque this morning (Monday) and 45 worshippers were kidnapped, but we have rescued 35 of the kidnapped victims. Efforts are also on to rescue the remaining people.\u201d\n\nAbdulsalami Debunks Alleged Link with Terrorists, Bandits\n\nMeanwhile, a former Head of State, Gen. Abubakar Abdulsalami, has denied any link with any terrorist or bandit group.\n\nAbubakar, in a statement made available yesterday to journalists in Minna, Niger State, by his media aide, Dr. Yakubu Sulaiman, described\n\nthe claim of his having such link as: \u201cfalse unfounded and fake news.\u201d\n\nHis clarification came against the backdrop of a report on the alleged arrest of a helicopter allegedly belonging to him for supplying food and weapons to terrorists and bandits in parts of the country.\n\nAbdulsalami said he did not own such a helicopter.\n\nHe disassociated himself from what he described as such \u201ca heinous crime that is unbecoming of any patriotic citizen,\u201d saying he would have ignored such spurious reports but had to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cThis kind of fake news has the potential of aggravating the already tensed security situation in the country and should not be condoned,\u201d he said.\n\nHe regretted that individuals could be so \u201ccallous to peddle such news and smear the image and character of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerians to ignore such treacherous acts and be careful with the kind of information being dished out and shared on the social media,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to continue to work and pray for enduring peace in Nigeria, stressing that no nation can attain greatness without peace and security of lives and property of its citizens.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Electronic Call-Up System Sabotage Worsens Apapa Gridlock",
          "text": "\u2022Customs agents decry policy failure, extortion\n\nBy Eromosele Abiodun\n\nTraffic has worsened in Apapa and its environs following the disruption of the electronic call-up system (ETO) introduced about two months ago by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) with the support of the Lagos State Government to ensure free flow of vehicular movements.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation showed that security agents, who were said to have frustrated all efforts to restore sanity to the port city, have cashed in on the situation to extort articulated vehicles\u2019 drivers.\n\nEven the efforts of a presidential task team failed with tales of corruption trailing its assignment.\n\nHowever, following the return of sanity to the roads in Apapa last month as a result of the Electronic Call-up System, the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had vowed to expose the cabal behind the Apapa gridlock if they did not desist from sabotaging the government\u2019s efforts at ensuring a free flow of traffic.\n\nHe had said: \u201cWhat we are doing now is taking away unscrupulous persons benefiting from the gridlock. Whatever they are earning, whatever they are taking, whatever they are gaining, we are taking it away from them. We know they will fight back, but I am saying it clearly that we are ready for them. We will fight anyone who tries to return us to the past experience in Apapa. We will name and shame them, and bring them to the public court to show our seriousness. We will no longer condone the recklessness and impunity that our people have experienced before now.\u201d\n\nBut barely four weeks after the Electronic Call-up system cleared the gridlock the chaos has returned as truckers who park indiscriminately along the port access roads, impede the free flow of traffic.\n\nExperts and stakeholders told THISDAY that the failure of government policies, entrenched interest and security agencies, who have made an industry out of the crisis will never allow any effort to solve the crisis work.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some NPA security personnel, LASTMA operatives, and policemen have spent over five years in Apapa, as the gridlock has made the Apapa area the most lucrative beat.\n\nOperatives of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) have also aggravated the traffic crisis by blocking the roads to inspect consignments that have been cleared at the port by their colleagues.\n\nThe NCS operatives are permanently stationed at Area B and Mile 2 where they carry out an inspection on the highways.\n\nThe Chief Operating Officer of Trucks Transit Park (TTP) Limited, vendors of the ETO, Mr. Dayo Adeboye, told THISDAY yesterday that security agents and those profiting from the crisis were the major challenge to the electronic call-up system.\n\nAccording to him, they decided to sabotage the process because the electronic call-up system did not allow them to extort money from the transporters.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, what they have resolved to do is that they will make life difficult during the day and extort money at night when there is nobody to stop them from extorting drivers. We also blame the truck drivers because they offer bribes because they want to beat the system.\n\n\u201cThey cannot continue to accuse the security agencies because there has to be a willing giver for there to be a receiver. The transporters too are not helping matters they should stop offering bribes to beat the system.\u201d\n\nOn the decision to exclude factory-bound trucks and petroleum takers from inception, he said the decision was a strategy to avoid gang-up against the initiative.\n\n\u201cIt was a strategy; when we started, we knew that we could not take the entire traffic in Apapa at once. We also had the extortion cartel in mind. We knew that if we tried to stop all the money these people were collecting, they would make sure nothing ever worked for us. So, we decided to start with port-bound trucks, which are 50 per cent of the traffic. Our plan was to move to oil and gas drivers after that and then factory-bound truckers.\n\n\u201cThe oil and gas are in two divisions, you have the major marketers and the independent marketers. The major marketers are six and they control half of the volume of petroleum tankers. Now, the major marketers if you look at the way they are structured, they came onboard onto ETO very easily because they have truck parks and electronic gating system in their premises,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the independent marketers have tank farms all over the place without facilities and parking space.\n\nHe said, independent marketers were to be integrated after they put in place their facilities and structured plan.\n\nHe said many manufacturers within the Apapa zone had approached him to join the platform so they could have a legal way to enter Apapa.\n\nOn the way forward, he said the NPA should discuss with the Lagos State Government to onboard other trailer drivers.\n\n\u201cWe have cleared the road in Apapa and the tankers have now taken over and they are not structured. So, you find out that many more vessels are coming to the area like Aiteo and NIPCO to come and deliver their cargo and leaving the Tincan Island area and that has pushed oil and gas traffic. Government has to do two things: Decongest Mile 2 to Sunrise along Apapa- Oshodi; dislodge the activities of area boys on that road and dislodge tanker drivers that use the road for parking.\n\n\u201cSecondly, they have to have the tanker drivers start with a structured approach into Apapa as well. NPA cannot clear the road for tanker drivers to start doing unstructured business there.\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is the road construction going on has eliminated one-half of the bridge, so, we are only using one-half of the bridge to work now. The ongoing road construction and the activities of the tanker drivers make the road impassable. All the traffic is now diverted to the Apapa side and you have the pressure of traffic on that side. Right now, Apapa is taking more than the traffic it can handle,\u201d he stated.\n\nVice President of the National Association of Licensed Customs Agents (ANALCA), Dr. Kayode Farinto, also told THISDAY that the security agencies would never allow any effort to solve the Apapa gridlock to work and urged the government to adopt the intermodal port system.\n\nHe also called on the federal government to open up the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway that is 80 per cent completed.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is happening is that at night, the road construction company will use heavy blocks to barricade the road and will only open it for any truck who gives N20,000 to the security agencies. From Tincan Island Port to Mile 2 along Apapa Oshodi road they are there extorting truckers. They constitute a nuisance along that corridor and if they are taken out, it will solve the problem to some extent.\n\n\u201cThe government has to relocate all the tank farms in Apapa; if that is not done, there is no miracle that we can have. We will continue to have gridlock in Apapa. The residents of Apapa are crying daily.\u201d\n\nFarinto added that the only solution to the crisis was for the government to embrace the intermodal port system.\n\nHe said the barges that were only recently introduced to reduce the pressure on the road have been balkanised by entrenched interests.\n\n\u201cIf you want to move cargo via barges now, it is expensive and frustrating. If you bring in the best experts in the whole world to come and manage Apapa traffic, that expert will be disgraced in under one week. Look at the beautiful idea brought in by NPA to solve the problem. The electronic call-up would have worked if not for the human factor. There are people who believe it is their right to make money from the chaos. We have officers in Area B who claimed to have been posted directly from the Office of the Inspector-General of Police and there is a specific amount they collect from each truck each day. And they collect the money openly before everybody \u2013 very glaring,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe National President of the National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA), the umbrella body of customs agents in Nigeria, Mr. Lucky Amiwero, blamed the Apapa congestion on the wrong concession that was done by the federal government and the sighting of tank farms around the port.\n\nHe said before the concession, there were holding bays inside the ports for trucks to park, adding that those holding bays have now been converted to private use.\n\n\u201cBefore the concession there were holding bays and truck parks inside the port. In Apapa port, the holding bays are inside the port; at Lilly Pond, the holding bay is under the bridge; at Tincan Island Port, the holding bay is at the front of the port; at Kirikiri jetty, the holding bay is at the front of the jetty but all these were later converted to terminals.\n\n\u201cIn the entire holding bay, the importers and customs agents pay the fees. The ports were concessioned without a law backing them. That was where the problem started. As a member of several government committees and I warned this would happen. By law government warehouses are supposed to be inside all the ports but where are the warehouses? The government hurriedly gave out the place without law. What they did was lease agreement and not concession and by the provisions of the NPA Act, they only had five years for the lease not the 30 years in the concession,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the situation in Apapa is a disorganised system without any law and procedure.\n\nHe stated that the essence of having a port regulator was to guide against the chaos in Apapa, adding that this is not provided for in the concession.\n\nHe advocated a separate access road or exit for factory-bound trucks and relocation of petroleum tank farms from Apapa.\n\nHe said the absence of law backing the concession made it impossible to regulate the terminal operators and shipping companies whom he alleged played a major role in the crisis.\n\nA maritime analyst, Dr. Bolaji Akinola, told THISDAY that the solution to the Apapa conundrum is to take cargo off the road and embrace the intermodal port system.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe trucks that go to Apapa are not only port-bound trucks and I think this is where the electronic call-up system arrangement missed it because the focus of the electronic call-up was on the port-bound trucks, especially container trucks that were going to drop empties, export containers, or pick up imports. There are three distinct categories of trucks that go into Apapa every day.\n\n\u201cYou have the port-bound trucks; you also have the factories\u2019 trucks, which are a sizeable number. They are the trucks that go to the factories located around Apapa-Dangote Sugar, Flower Mills, Honey Well, and BUA, and many more. And we have the petroleum tankers that go to load petroleum products. Don\u2019t forget almost the totalities of the petroleum products consumed in Nigeria today are imported. Based on the recent research, the port-bound trucks constitute only about 60 per cent of the total, and the other 40 per cent is made up of factory trucks and petroleum tankers or tank farm-bound trucks.\n\n\u201cWhen the electronic call-up system was created, it meant to provide call up for port-bound trucks.\u201d\n\nThe electronic call-up, he added, did not factor in the trucks doing business at the factories, which are over 1,000 trucks per day and also the tankers that go to the tank farms and jetties to pick up products.\n\nHe put the number of petroleum tankers going to the port daily at over 2,000.\n\nHe described the security agents who made the crisis a cash cow as opportunists, saying that it is the failure of the system that gave them the opportunity.\n\nHe called for more truck parks to be created, adding that the eight created by the NPA are not enough for even the port trucks.\n\n\u201cThey must create sufficient truck parks that will hold a minimum of 7,000 trucks. That will handle the port, factory, and petroleum trucks coming to Apapa. And all of them must be on the electronic call-up platform and go to the port when it is their turn to do so. However, that will be the short-term approach.\n\n\u201cAnother approach will be to constantly shuffle the security agents and port officials that control traffic in Apapa. When you leave these officials there for too long, they understand the system and how lucrative their posting can be and then deliberately create problems to bring back chaos to make money,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "40 years without Robert Nesta Marley, the Apostle of One Love",
          "text": "May 1981. I was pretty much young. Radio stations were playing Bob Marley non-stop. One Love. Redemption Song. No Woman No Cry. Rastaman Vibration. On and on and on. I overheard my older cousin, now of blessed memory, discussing with a neighbour that \u201cBob Marley is dead\u201d. She looked sad. On my uncle\u2019s table were several Marley cassettes. The one that fascinated me the most was the cover of \u2018Uprising\u2019, his last studio album. He had his arms raised and his head bent backwards, with his dreadlocks, as thick as the roots of an Iroko, touching the ground. I wondered: how can a human being have such thick and long locks? Much later, I would understand it was an artist\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a kid, I enjoyed Marley\u2019s music but understood not much about his message and knew pretty little about the man. I used to think, for instance, that \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019 meant women were the source of tears. If there were no women, there would be no tears. But as I grew older and paid attention to the song, I heard the lines: \u2018O my little sister, don\u2019t shed no tears/No woman no cry\u2019 and \u2018So dry your tears I say\u2019. He was actually asking the \u201cwoman\u201d not to \u201ccry\u201d \u2014 in Jamaican patois. I would later understand that the song highlights the toils of Jamaican women, his widowed mother inclusive, who struggled to fend for their families. The message was lost in translation to me.\n\nCedella Marley gave birth to the legend on February 6, 1945. The father, Norval Sinclair Marley, who was white, was born in Crowborough, East Sussex, UK, in 1885, and reportedly worked in Lagos, Nigeria, as a member of the colonial army after WW1. He then relocated to Jamaica, where he served as a plantation officer. He named his little boy Nesta (\u201cwise messenger\u201d) Robert Marley at birth, although the name order was re-arranged to Robert (\u201cBob\u201d) Nesta Marley by a Jamaican passport official who said Nesta was a girl\u2019s name. Maybe he was right \u2014 Nesta, shortened from Ernesta, is feminine in Wales and means \u201cpure\u201d. Elsewhere, it is unisex and has different meanings.\n\nNorval was 60 and Cedella 18 when they had Bob. At 70, Norval died of a heart attack. That was Bob becoming fatherless at 10. He barely knew his father, who was hardly at home because of work schedule. The parental burden thereafter fell on the widow, who had to fend for Bob all by herself, mustering her finances to make his favourite dish, cornmeal porridge, which he sang about in \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019. He once said of his mum: \u201cOf all the women who told me they loved me, the only one who didn\u2019t hurt me was my mother.\u201d The mum said Bob, even as a pre-teen, always had a special place in her heart: she always jumped up to serve him anytime he asked for anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCedella gave him a free hand. He came home one day and said he was dropping out of high school to sing. The mum, a chorister, challenged him to sing a tune, and little Bob excellently rendered \u2018Don\u2019t Touch My Tomatoes\u2019, a lewd calypso hit in the 1940s. He passed the audition. At 22, Marley, who also sang in the choir, told his mum he would no longer go to church, that Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia was the black messiah, and that he would now be a Rastafarian. This was more difficult for the mum to accept: she was a Christian and had, in fact, been baptised when she was pregnant with Bob. But she let him be. This was a lot of concession in an era when parents took all the decisions.\n\nWith the breadwinner gone, mother and child had relocated to Trench Town, the Ajegunle of Kingston, the Jamaican capital. It became Marley\u2019s adopted hometown, in whose honour he wrote a song: \u2018We come from Trench Town/We free the people with music.\u2019 Cedella went on to have more children: one girl with the father of Neville O\u2019Riley Livingston (\u201cBunny Wailer\u201d) and two boys with Edward Booker, an American whom she married after permanently relocating to the US. Back in Trench Town, Marley got his singing buddies, Bunny Wailer and Hubert Winston McIntosh (\u201cPeter Tosh\u201d), together and The Wailers were born in 1963. We all know the rest of the story.\n\nTHE MUSIC: REGGAE ON BROADWAY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore founding The Wailers, Marley had recorded several solo ska tunes which were not commercially successful. His first was the philosophical \u2018Judge Not\u2019, recorded in 1962 when he was 17. You might be familiar with these lines: \u2018The road of life is rocky/And you may stumble too/So while you talk about me/Someone else is judging you.\u2019 There are similar lines in \u2018Could You Be Loved\u2019, a track in his last studio album in 1980 when he had become a global icon. He recorded a divorce number, \u2018One Cup of Coffee\u2019, under a pseudonym, Bobby Martell, also in 1962. Listen to him: \u2018Just one cup of coffee then I\u2019ll go/So I just dropped by to let you know/That I\u2019m leaving you tomorrow/I\u2019ll cause you no more sorrow\u2026\u2019\n\nThe Wailers, joined by three more members in 1963, dreamt of being \u201cthe Beatles from Jamaica\u201d. They called themselves the Teenagers, the Wailing Rudeboys and the Wailing Wailers, before finally settling for The Wailers. The trio benefitted immensely from vocal trainings by Joe Higgs, a Jamaican music great who also tutored Jimmy Cliff, another reggae legend. Tosh, in particular, was a genius: he learnt the guitar by just watching someone play. He also played the keyboard and organ. His vocal range was incredible. His harmony on \u2018Concrete Jungle\u2019 always leaves me with goose bumps. He organised the back-up vocals for the group. Bunny was nimble-fingered on bongo and conga drums.\n\nThe Wailers\u2019 1964 ska single, \u2018Simmer Down\u2019, topped Jamaican charts. In 1965, they released their first LP, \u2018Wailing Wailers\u2019 (a name now desecrated in Nigeria). It was not a studio album but a compilation of their hit singles from previous years, including \u2018One Love\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m Still Waiting\u2019 and the chart-topping \u2018Simmer Down\u2019. All but four of the 12 tracks were written or co-written by Marley. He who could write, compose and sing a hell lot. It was crystal clear from the beginning who among the trio was going to be the biggest star \u2014 long before they met Chris Blackwell, the UK record mogul usually accused by Tosh\u2019s fans of promoting Marley above other Wailers because of his skin tone.\n\nThe \u2018Wailing Wailers\u2019 compilation was all ska and rocksteady, the genres that would go on and give birth to \u201creggay\u201d \u2014 the name first used for the emerging genre by Toots and the Maytals in their 1968 album, \u2018Do The Reggay\u2019. Ska was fast-paced, infused with elements of calypso, and was very rich in horns, while rocksteady was mellow with a jazzy feel, but the reggae offspring was even slower and richer in bass, with a ticking rhythm. Ska, rocksteady and reggae sounds were, in any case, all influenced by American jazz and R&B, the dominant global music at the time. Targeting the American market, Marley even experimented with R&B in the song, \u2018Reggae on Broadway\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the Wailers had recorded a number of hits, toured wide, set many records and enjoyed some success, the reggae audience was still predominantly Jamaican. They did not have access to modern recording studios. For a band that wanted to do what the Beatles and Rolling Stones were doing, they also needed the cross-over appeal without losing the basic identity of reggae. These challenges had limited the global commercial success of their music. The story started to change in 1969 as producers, working with The Wailers, refined the emerging reggae music, de-emphasising the ska horns and introducing the electric guitar. It was the beginning of a revolution.\n\nIn 1972, a mini-disaster turned into a destiny-changer \u2014 for Marley in particular. They had worked with Johnny Nash, the American singer, in Sweden and later the UK. They ran out of cash after Nash returned to the US. They were unable to return to Jamaica or work in London. Their road manager, Brent Clarke, audaciously approached Blackwell, a producer and owner of Island Records, to ask for the royalties on their songs that he had released in the UK. But Blackwell was so enamoured with Marley that he offered them not just tickets back to Jamaica but also a contract to record an album. The advance royalty of \u00a34,000 was irresistible. They signed. That, basically, was the turning point for reggae globally.\n\nThey returned to Jamaica, recorded songs for the album, \u2018Catch A Fire\u2019, and Marley returned to London with the tapes for post-production in a state-of-the-art studio, until then the exclusive preserve of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll artistes. Of the nine tracks, Marley wrote seven, including \u2018Stir it Up\u2019 (covered by Nash), and Tosh did two. The album was released in April 1973. There was a legal hitch \u2014 The Wailers had subsisting contracts with CBS Records and Sims \u2014 but this was overshadowed by the success of the album, peaking at 117 on Billboard 200 and establishing The Wailers as an international band. \u2018Catch A Fire\u2019 is still regarded as one of the greatest reggae albums ever.\n\nCracks were beginning to emerge as other Wailers felt Marley was being favoured by Blackwell. In fact, Blackwell credited an issue of the \u2018Catch A Fire\u2019 album to \u201cBob Marley and the Wailers\u201d. Still riding on the waves of the album, they released Burnin\u2019 in October 1973. The sleeve design also had Marley as the dominant image. The 10-tracker, mostly written and composed by Marley, featured hits such as the militant \u2018Get Up Stand Up\u2019 (which he co-wrote with Tosh to address the favouritism concerns) and \u2018I Shot Sheriff\u2019. Eric Clapton, the legendary British rock and blues artiste, did a soft rock version of \u2018I Shot the Sheriff\u2019 in 1974 and it hit No 1 on Billboard Hot 100. This helped introduce reggae to a wider market. And bigger commercial success naturally followed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut things were changing fast in 1974. Burnin\u2019 marked the end of The Wailers as the world knew them. Tosh and Bunny left the band, complaining that their talents were being suppressed, with Tosh saying he was tired of being a \u201cbackrow\u201d singer. Undaunted, Marley picked up the pieces, rejigged the band and began another phase in his blossoming career. The new band had siblings Carlton and Aston \u201cFamily Man\u201d Barrett respectively on drums and bass. Carlton\u2019s one-drop beat was unbeatable and I would rate Aston as my best bass guitarist ever. Tyrone Downie and Earl \u201cWya\u201d Lindo played the keyboards. Alvin \u201cSeeco\u201d Patterson handled percussion. Junior Marvin and Al Anderson were on the lead guitar.\n\nWith Marley playing the rhythm guitar and Rita, his wife, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths (named \u201cI Three\u201d) providing the female background vocals, Bob Marley and The Wailers took the world by storm, releasing six outstanding studio albums \u2014 \u2018Natty Dread\u2019 (1974), \u2018Rastaman Vibration\u2019 (1976), \u2018Exodus\u2019 (1977), \u2018Kaya\u2019 (1978), \u2018Survival\u2019 (1979) and \u2018Uprising\u2019 (1980) \u2014 as well as two live albums, \u2018Live!\u2019 (1975) and \u2018Babylon by Bus\u2019 (1978). The hits poured in endlessly and the commercial success was massive. Marley became the face of reggae and Rastafarianism across the world. Two years after his death, \u2018Confrontation\u2019 was released. It was a compilation of unreleased, mostly remastered materials.\n\nEvidently, success did not come to Marley on a platter of gold, just that he believed in his talent and never stopped toiling. When The Wailers were signed to Studio One in Jamaica in 1964, they hardly got paid for all the hits they were churning out amid soaring sales. Late 1965, Marley \u2014 who had trained as a welder after dropping out of school \u2014 decided to go to the US to work, earn money and return to Jamaica to set up a label for The Wailers. Using the alias \u201cDonald Marley\u201d, he worked two jobs: as a DuPont lab assistant and on a Chrysler plant assembly line in Newark. He returned in 1967. Tuff Gong Studios was founded in 1970, to the chagrin of the Big Three Jamaican labels \u2014 Studio One, Treasure Isle and Federal. Marley\u2019s song, \u2018Small Axe\u2019, was a snide message to them: \u2018If you are the big tree (Big Three)/We are the small axe (small acts)/Ready to cut you down.\u2019\n\nTHE MESSAGE: ONE LOVE, AFRICA UNITE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarley\u2019s life was defined by Rastafarianism. Marcus Garvey, the Jamaican activist, had \u201cprophesied\u201d in 1916: \u201cLook to Africa for the crowning of the Black king. He shall be the redeemer.\u201d When Ras Tafari Makonnen (Selassie I) was crowned as the Ethiopian emperor in 1930, some Jamaicans said the black God was finally here and Rastafarianism was promptly born under the leadership of Leonard Howell, \u201cthe First Rasta\u201d. Selassie, who was a Christian and never called himself a messiah, later said: \u201cI met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.\u201d Some Rastas believe that his denial was the final confirmation that he was indeed the black messiah!\n\nGarvey, who died in 1940, was said to have been scornful of the Rastafarian belief in the divinity of Selassie, but Rastas do not hold this against the great Afro-Jamaican Pan-Africanist. Instead, they even idolise Garvey as a prophet. In 1914, Garvey had founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA) for the advancement of people of African ancestry. He declared himself the \u201cprovisional president\u201d of Africa. He was an inspiration for black nationalists across the world: our own Dr Nnamdi \u201cZik\u201d Azikiwe, also a Pan-Africanist, met with Garvey while studying for a master\u2019s at the University of Pennsylvania in the US in 1932. Zik would lead Nigeria to Independence in 1960.\n\nGarvey\u2019s influence on Marley was evident in his 1980 solo acoustic track, \u2018Redemption Song\u2019, in which he borrowed from the inspiring speech Garvey gave on October 1, 1934 in Nova Scotia, Canada: \u201cWe are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind.\u201d Sounds familiar? What about this? Garvey always ended his speeches with: \u201cOne Love!\u201d One of Marley\u2019s most popular songs is titled \u2018One Love\u2019. Like Garvey, Marley yearned for the homecoming of all Africans. In \u2018Africa Unite\u2019, he sang: \u2018How good and pleasant it would be/Before God and man/To see the unification of all Africans\u2026\u2019\n\nMarley\u2019s \u2018War\u2019 is one of the most political songs he ever did, inspired entirely by Selassie\u2019s speech to the UN in 1963: \u201cThat until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned; that until there are no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation; that until the colour of a man\u2019s skin is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes; that until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race; that until that day, the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion, to be pursued but never attained.\n\n\u201cAnd until the ignoble and unhappy regimes that hold our brothers in Angola, in Mozambique and in South Africa in subhuman bondage have been toppled and destroyed; until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and good-will; until all Africans stand and speak as free beings, equal in the eyes of all men, as they are in the eyes of Heaven; until that day, the African continent will not know peace. We Africans will fight, if necessary, and we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil.\u201d In setting the stirring speech to music, Marley added a commanding refrain: \u201cEverywhere is war!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be deceived by the war rhetoric \u2014 Marley was a peacemaker. He nearly gave his life for it in 1976. Political tensions between Jamaican PM Michael Manley and opposition leader, Edward Seaga, were thick. A peace-building concert was organised and Marley was scheduled to play. Two days to the concert, gunmen attacked his home, seriously injuring his wife and manager. Marley got away with minor injuries and defiantly went ahead to play at the concert without the terrified Wailers. \u201cThe people who are trying to make this world worse aren\u2019t taking a day off. How can I?\u201d he said thereafter, before going on self-exile in the UK till 1978. He got the UN peace medal same year, after getting the Jamaican political rivals to hold hands on stage at the One Love Peace Concert \u2014 amid rising political violence.\n\nMuch of his lyrical content was biblical but he got more overtly political with time. \u2018Survival\u2019 (1979) explicitly preaches Africa\u2019s total liberation. The track, \u2018Zimbabwe\u2019, was the anthem of the Zimbabwean freedom fighters, led by Robert Mugabe. He sang: \u2018Everyman has the right to decide his own destiny/And in this judgement there is no partiality\u2026 We\u2019ll have to fight/We gonna fight/We\u2019ll have to fight/Fighting for our rights!\u2019 Marley would play at Zimbabwe\u2019s Independence celebration on April 18, 1980, bearing all his costs \u2014 even importing the PA system because the new country couldn\u2019t afford one.\n\nHis Rastafarian message was even more prominent in his lyrics. His last album, in particular, was all about the message of his creed \u2014 \u2018Zion Train\u2019 coming to take the \u201crighteous\u201d home (\u2018Which man can save his brother\u2019s soul?\u2019 he asked); \u2018Coming in from the Cold\u2019 (\u2018Will you let the system make you kill your brotherman? No, dread, no); \u2018Forever Loving Jah\u2019 (\u2018They say we\u2019re going wrong/To all the people we meet/But we won\u2019t worry/We won\u2019t shed no tears/We found a way/To cast away the fears\u2019). He constantly celebrated marijuana, which the Rastas see as \u201choly weed\u201d. That religious people consume his music without prejudice \u2014 as they do Fela\u2019s \u2014 is a testimony to the power of his art and philosophy.\n\nHe consistently fought for human rights, as we see in \u2018Get Up, Stand Up\u2019, which was inspired during a tour of Haiti. The poverty he saw in Haiti was probably worse than he had seen in his home country. \u2018I Shot the Sheriff\u2019 is, to me, an #EndSARS song. The lyrics appear to be a campaign about acting in self-defence against police brutality. However, in 2012, Esther Anderson, the Jamaican song writer and Marley\u2019s former girlfriend, said the line, \u2018Every time I plant a seed/He says kill them before they grow\u2019, was a veiled reference to his dislike for her use of birth control which he described as a sin, and that the original title was \u2018I Shot the Doctor\u2019. But why don\u2019t I really believe her story?\n\nMarley himself was not forthcoming. In a 1975 interview, he said: \u201cI Shot The Sheriff is like I shot wickedness. That\u2019s not really a sheriff, it\u2019s the elements of wickedness. The elements of that song is people been judging you and you can\u2019t stand it no more and you explode, you just explode.\u201d A year later, he changed tune. \u201cI want to say \u2018I shot the police\u2019 but the government would have made a fuss so I said \u2018I shot the sheriff\u2019 instead. But it\u2019s the same idea: justice,\u201d he said. Clapton, whose cover of the song contributed immensely to selling reggae to the white audience, said Marley was vague when he himself asked him about the meaning. I would still take it as a song against police savagery.\n\nMarley also sang romantic songs all his life, from ska to rocksteady to reggae. He captured the contradictions of romance. He celebrated the longings of love as much as he highlighted the heartbreaks. The same person who sang \u2018One Cup of Coffee\u2019 \u2014 gleefully announcing a break-up \u2014 also sang \u2018Stay with Me\u2019, pleading: \u2018Down on my knees/Begging you please/Stay with me/Have I done you so wrong girl?\u2019 He sang \u2018my woman is gone\u2019 as well as \u2018I wanna love you and treat you right\u2019. \u2018Mellow Mood\u2019, \u2018Turn Your Lights Down Low\u2019, \u2018Satisfy My Soul\u2019 and \u2018There She Goes\u2019 tell love stories with differing but real-life emotions. In all, however, he never derided or sexualised women.\n\nTHE MAN: MONEY CAN\u2019T BUY LIFE\n\nYet, Marley was not the most faithful husband. In 1966, he married Ms Alpharita Constantia Anderson, a Cuban beauty who came with two children from a previous marriage. Both were adopted by Marley, who would go on to have children with different women, including notably Cindy Breakspeare, Miss World 1976 and mother of Damian, winner of multiple Grammys. Marley was officially father of 11. Rita, who had been mentored as a singer by Marley before they fell in love, had three children with him and, reportedly, two from extra-marital affairs. They deserved each other, in that case. It would appear they had an open marriage as the world has come to know it today.\n\nWhile weed and women could be easily classified as his vices, Marley was not known to have the other iniquities common to mega stars: egotism and doing drugs (if we treat marijuana as a minor drug as Rastas would have us do). Rather, he was down to earth and was once quoted as saying: \u201cTo myself, I am not famous.\u201d He had a kind heart. He gave the writing credits of some of his songs to his friends to help them earn the royalties. For instance, \u2018No Woman No Cry\u2019 is credited to Vincent Ford, his friend who ran a soup kitchen in Trench Town, so that he would receive the royalty payments to keep his business going. This also helped Marley bypass some disputes with the song publishers.\n\nMarley had an unusual arrangement with his band members. A royalties-based agreement with the record labels was not going to be as lucrative as his offer of generous salaries. The band members settled for his generosity. They were quite happy. After Marley\u2019s death, the lack of a contract became a problem as the band members were no longer getting any payments. One of them, Aston, headed for the courts in 2006 demanding \u00a360 million in \u201cunpaid royalties\u201d to himself and his late brother, Carlton, since Marley\u2019s death. He lost. Wayne Jobson, a musician who knew Marley and the band well, retorted: \u201cBob would be turning in his grave to think they weren\u2019t getting any money.\u201d\n\nHis philosophy of money was phenomenal \u2014 for someone who grew up in poverty. He preferred contentment. \u201cMoney is numbers and numbers never end. If it takes money to be happy, your search for happiness will never end,\u201d he told an interviewer. Asked if he was rich, he replied with a question: \u201cWhat is rich?\u201d The interviewer rephrased: \u201cDo you have a lot of possessions?\u201d He retorted: \u201cPossessions make you rich? I don\u2019t have that type of richness. My richness is life, forever.\u201d Cedella, his eldest child, said: \u201cMy father would say that if I can\u2019t help plenty of people I don\u2019t want it.\u201d On his death bed, Marley\u2019s last words to his eldest son, Ziggy, were: \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy life.\u201d\n\nBob Marley, the singer, songwriter, philosopher and football lover, died on May 11, 1981 at the Cedars Of Lebanon Hospital in Miami, US. Death was definitely coming. In July 1977, he was diagnosed with a cancer on his toe. There was an immediate solution: amputation. Marley stubbornly refused the option, saying it was against his religious beliefs. More so, he felt it was going to hamper his stage performance. Things got worse and he expertly hid his pains. He was still touring, and even drew his largest concert audience of 100,000 in Milan, Italy in 1980. He also had two concerts at Madison Square Garden, New York. After collapsing while jogging, it was discovered the cancer had spread to other parts of the body \u2014 brain, liver and lungs.\n\nIn the end, nobody wants to die. He desperately resorted to alternative treatments, which were ineffective. He started reading the Bible daily and cut his falling dreadlocks. On November 4, 1980, Archbishop Abuna Yesehaq baptised him \u201cin the name of Jesus Christ\u201d into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, New York, and gave him the name Berhane Selassie (\u201cLight of the Holy Trinity\u201d). He had always resisted the Christian baptism but there is every chance Marley died a Christian, not a Rasta. His mum, who died in 2005, said she learnt from his friends much later that he said he would die at 36 \u201clike Jesus\u201d. It appears Jesus died at 33 though; but, at least, Marley did at 36 as he predicted.\n\nHe packed so much into his 36 years and left golden footprints behind. \u2018Legend\u2019, a compilation of Marley\u2019s UK Top 40 hit singles, is the highest-selling reggae album ever, with 25 million units sold worldwide. It has spent 676 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart since its release in 1984 \u2014 the second longest run of any album, next only to Pink Floyd\u2019s \u2018The Dark Side of the Moon\u2019. In 2020, \u2018Legend\u2019 was ranked No 48 on Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s 500 greatest albums of all time. \u2018Exodus\u2019 was named Album of the Century by Time magazine in 1999. \u2018One Love\u2019 is BBC\u2019s Song of the Millennium. Marley was No 11 on Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s Top 100 Artists of All Time in 2004.\n\nFor all his endeavour, though, Marley never got a Grammy. But this is more of an indictment on the judges. Reggae was not reckoned with by the Grammy organisers until 1985, by which time Marley had died \u2014 but there was a \u201cworld music\u201d category for which he could have been considered. His children have made up for it, winning a combined total of 13 Grammys. Belatedly, Marley got a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys in 2001, the year he got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2018, Forbes magazine listed Marley as No 5 on the list of the post-humous highest-earning celebrities.\n\nI might have known little about the man and his message when I was a kid but by the time I was 17, I had collected every Marley song I could find and read extensively about him. It was inevitable that I would adore and idolise him. I started toying with Rastafarianism in 1987. Thankfully, I never touched the weed. I also didn\u2019t believe in Selassie\u2019s divinity, but I mouthed the obligatory \u201cKing of kings, Lord of lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\u201d. I even aspired to be a reggae artiste. I wrote and composed over a hundred songs, inspired mainly by Marley\u2019s philosophy. In September 1993, I ditched Rastafarianism and embraced the Christian faith. But it was fun while it lasted.\n\nAll photos, except otherwise stated, are from the official Instagram page of Bob Marley.",

          "text": "SpaceX, an American private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, is seeking necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its internet service into Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by Ryan Goodnight, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, in a meeting with Nigerian Communications Commission\u2019s (NCC) Executive Vice-Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, last Friday in Abuja.\n\nFrom L \u2013 R: Consultant to SpaceX, Levin Born; Director, Spectrum Administration, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Oluwatoyin Asaju; Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska; SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight and Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu, during the SpaceX\u2019s presentation to the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Goodnight, Nigeria has been identified as a critical market in Africa. Before the face-to-face meeting happened last week, SpaceX had been discussing with the NCC virtually over the past several months.\n\nAbout Starlink\n\nIn 2002, Elon Musk founded SpaceX to revolutionize space technology and reduce space transportation costs. In 2020, the company expanded its efforts to provide satellite internet service: they called the product Starlink. As of March 2021, Starlink had more than 1,100 satellites in space.\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas.\n\nIt is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nCost and Competitors\n\nStarlink is currently in beta, meaning not everyone can sign up. Its beta service comes with a price tag of $99 (~\u20a640,000) per month. There\u2019s also a $499 (~\u20a6200,000) upfront cost to cover the Starlink kit, which includes all of the necessary hardware: a small satellite dish, a router, power supply, and mounting tripod.\n\nCredit: SpaceX\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these rates are just for beta customers. Prices could change when the service becomes more readily available.\n\nAccording to the company, over 10,000 customers currently have access to Starlink, with over 500,000 orders. It plans to expand into many service areas later in 2021.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink appears to be a more expensive option, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nWith the Nigerian government\u2019s plan to bring in 90% of its population online by 2025, it\u2019ll be open to multiple avenues to bring this to reality. There are already a number of internet initiatives such as Facebook\u2019s 2Africa, a $1 billion undersea internet cable for faster internet in Africa and Google and Econet\u2019s partnership.\n\nStarlink\u2019s presence in Nigeria is exciting, but as we\u2019ve seen from the Google Loon project, which was abandoned earlier this year, time will tell if it succeeds.",

          "title": "Blessing Abeng on dreaming in French, learning on the job, and overcoming career failures",
          "text": "I\u2019m bringing Blessing Abeng to centre stage because I am inspired by her dedication to supporting Africa\u2019s rising tech talent through her role as Director of Communications at Ingressive For Good. Blessing is a go-getter who is eager to learn and isn\u2019t afraid to ask questions or have difficult conversations. I admire Blessing\u2019s courage and commitment to keep going despite the occasional obstacles life has thrown at her.\n\nBusy schedules, French verbs, and healthy work habits\n\nYou seem like a busy woman. What does a typical day look like for you?\n\nI think that\u2019s one of the hardest questions to answer. You know how lots of successful people recommend having and sticking to a routine because it helps you plan your life and whatnot? Yeah, that has never really worked for me.\n\nHaha! Really?\n\nYup! When you work in communication, no two days are the same. Some days I don\u2019t sleep. Some days I sleep and wake up at 6 am. And some days I sleep in [laughs]. So the way I plan my day is dependent on my goals and objectives. There\u2019s also the fact that I am taking French classes at the moment.\n\nPause. Tell me why you are learning French?\n\nPlease don\u2019t laugh. I want to be able to dream and think in another language that isn\u2019t English. Learning a different language opens your mind up to a myriad of possibilities and expands the way you think. Learning French has shown me that people think differently based on their first or second language.\n\nVery interesting. Where are you taking classes and how does learning French affect your day-to-day work?\n\nI\u2019m taking a 360 approach to learning French. I\u2019m taking some lessons at Alliance Francaise de Lagos \u2013 which means I\u2019m up early at 5:30 AM to plan and kick off my day before classes start at 8 AM. I also use Duolingo and practice my speaking with online videos and courses.\n\nWow. And you do this every day?\n\nEvery single day. Sometimes during class, I am on my laptop responding to emails and doing some work. As you can imagine, my French teacher teases me a lot about overworking myself. I know the way I work, for the most part, isn\u2019t healthy, and I\u2019m learning that I cannot work like this and survive.\n\nCommunication skills, learning on the job and killing myths:\n\nSpeaking of jobs, what existing skillsets did you have before you joined Ingressive?\n\nI\u2019ve always had great leadership and digital marketing skills. I know my way around offline and online marketing tactics. I\u2019m great at storytelling and one of my strengths is creating and executing strategic plans.\n\nWhat did you learn on the job?\n\nI learned how to communicate with donors. Ingressive for Good is a non-profit company, so managing donors is a different ball game. I had to learn how to speak to donors and effectively communicate what we are doing at Ingressive. I also learned how to better manage my time and allocate my minutes and hours to my job, team members, and family members. The higher you go, the more work you have to do. I had to learn how to prioritize my time effectively.\n\nWhat are some myths you think it\u2019s important to kill?\n\nDon\u2019t just do the work \u2013 show the work. What does that mean? Well, I\u2019ve met people who believe that all they need to do is build a product and their customers will find it. That\u2019s not how things work. If you only do the work, and it doesn\u2019t get in front of the people who need it, you might not grow as fast as you want to. I recommend that founders prioritize showing the work as much as doing the work. If you aren\u2019t capable of doing it yourself, hire a comms person to do it.\n\nWhat skills should aspiring communications professionals be learning?\n\nPresentation skills. Presentation is important because as you grow you\u2019re going to have to start presenting to boards, senior leaders and executives. You need to be able to capture what\u2019s important without boring them.\n\nI also recommend that they should dedicate themselves to learning and assimilating ideas and best practices that are relevant to the industry. And don\u2019t just learn; go out and put into practice what you\u2019ve been taught online or in-person.\n\nHow do you define and navigate professional failures?\n\nFirstly, I remind myself that failing at a project does not mean I am a failure. I have only failed when I stop trying or I think, \u201cI have failed so let me give up.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s a place to exit projects that aren\u2019t working the way you want them to; but I don\u2019t allow failure to kick me down or make me lose my confidence or hope in life.\n\nSecondly, failing at a project does not mean you are not excellent. Failure gives you an opportunity to take stock and figure out what went wrong and what could have been done differently.\n\nThirdly, take your time to process the failure but don\u2019t dwell on it. I also recommend keeping track of your wins and successes. I have a \u201cwin journal\u201d and it helps me remember my accomplishments.\n\nThe intersection of family and work:\n\nMy dad wanted me to be a doctor. Obviously, that didn\u2019t happen. Back in the day, my mother used to get teased about having two daughters. Her co-workers would tell her, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a child yet because you don\u2019t have a son.\u201d\n\nWhat?\n\nYes! She used to cry about it and quite frankly, I stand by the fact that she was bullied at work. She didn\u2019t let it affect the way she raised us though. She simply encouraged us to work harder and prove to naysayers that gender isn\u2019t the ultimate marker for success in our society.\n\nSo you didn\u2019t go down the medicine path. How did you find your way to branding?\n\nA friend of mine recommended that I go to branding school and turn my creativity into a professional career path. I told my dad I was leaving Abuja and moving to Lagos to learn brand management and work in an agency. Even though he wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it, he still supported me. We signed an agreement: if my chosen path didn\u2019t work out after two years, I had to come back home.\n\nTrends, insights, and the future of business and tech in Africa:\n\nWhen you think about the tech and business ecosystem in Africa, what excites you? What do you think is possible?\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t know the future and I cannot predict that any of my thoughts will be fulfilled at some point in this life.\n\nDr Ola Brown once explained that small businesses are the lifeblood of a country. SMEs help with employability and boosting the economy \u2013 which means that we need to see more support for SMEs so they can hire our growing youth population. I believe that there is hope for our employment issues to be solved in the future because of the amount of funding coming into the country. I also see that an increasing number of small businesses are going out of their way to solve problems that our leaders have ignored for too long.\n\nI\u2019m also excited about the startups that are making bold moves. I applaud businesses like Flutterwave, Bankly and Paystack for going over and beyond to change the narrative about innovation and entrepreneurship in Nigeria.",

Instead, they want to be the backbone on which insurers depend for efficiency. Insurance from Pula and OKO target farmers, differentiating from the pack of health management organisations whose domain is health insurance.\n\nInsurance is a tough business to sell in poor communities as people prioritise present needs over saving against future loss. That poses challenging questions about the business model of insurance in Africa.\n\nInsurance industry respondents to the Catalyst Fund and Briter Bridges survey said commissions are how they make money. That is also how those in the credit business make money. It would seem then that insurers can learn some tricks from credit businesses to know what levers to pull for insurance to be more appealing and adopted by customers.\n\nA lot of the buzz about digital lending is in using data to provide tailored customer products and services. If well deployed, big data and analysis could be the pillar that boosts insurance in Africa, activating a market potential estimated to be up to $68 billion by McKinsey.\n\n\n\nThe investor and startup communities seem to think this future is achievable, a signal that we could yet see more investments into the insurance sector in the latter months of 2021.",

          "text": "Following its official launch, the new Learn at Home audio e-learning platform will provide free, online, and unlimited learning access to more than 100 million Nigerian youths.\n\nThis first-of-its-kind audio e-learning platform will offer unlimited access based on the national mobile phone penetration, low-data, and basic featurephone requirements. The platform is a continuum of Data Science Nigeria\u2019s successful \u2018LearnatHome\u2019 initiative, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, that provided learning to millions of Nigerian pupils amid the COVID-19 disruptive restrictions. Learn at Home is based on an inclusive e-learning approach. It is designed to eliminate the barriers of internet access (data) cost and over-dependency on expensive smartphones in the delivery of locally relevant, convenient, and inexpensive access to quality education.\n\nThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative, www.learnathome.radio is part of an extensive effort to reduce the urban-rural learning disparities in Nigeria.\n\nMastercard Foundation says it is a continuation of efforts to ensure universal learning and improve learning outcomes across all communities in Nigeria. Already, more than 4 million students have joined audio classes with USSD/SMS support, where they receive educational materials on key subjects, based on the Nigerian Educational Research and Development (NERDC) curriculum for primary and secondary school students. \u201cThe disruption of the pandemic did not only halt learning for many, but also revealed and exacerbated existing inequalities in learning opportunities. The purpose of www.learnathome.radio is to ensure children have equal, convenient, and affordable access to quality learning,\u201d said, Chidinma Lawanson, Country Head, Mastercard Foundation Nigeria.\n\nOn the platform, pupils and students from primary 1 to Senior Secondary (SS3) will gain access to a special examination readiness series that includes a collection of solved past questions in WAEC, NECO, BECE, and Common Entrance from 2009 to 2020. Expert teachers have been engaged to provide answers and explanations to the past questions in a step-by-step and easy-to-understand format, with complementary live classes that enable each student to learn at a preferred pace irrespective of location and socioeconomic conditions.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, Toyin Adekanmbi, the Executive Director of Data Science Nigeria, described it as \u201ca creative and innovative approach to democratize learning in Nigeria and provide an effective solution to the challenge of unequal distribution of learning and education opportunities in rural and urban communities.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative will build on the clear successes we recorded in the quest to ensure ongoing learning for children during the pandemic restrictions, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, through our audio classes in several cities in Nigeria. It is specifically designed for smooth functionality on basic feature phones operating on the EDGE or 2G network and low data. For MTN users, it is absolutely free. With this, children in rural and remote communities can learn from the highest quality teachers at their own pace and prepare for important examinations with the best resources and educational aids developed based on the approved curriculum.\u201d\n\nBesides the examination preparation series, www.learnathome.radio features a wide variety of content, including amazing global facts, inspirational quotes, current affairs, common errors in the English language, and much more. Mr. Nwachukwu, one of the parents, already taking advantage of the platform, praised it as a breakthrough innovation. \u201cBefore, platforms like this one, were usually only for those who could afford expensive laptops or smartphones and daily internet subscriptions. Now, every child, everywhere can learn.\u201d\n\nAbout Data Science Nigeria\n\nData Science Nigeria is a registered non-profit organization, run and managed by the Data Scientists Network Foundation, with a vision to build a world-class Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, research and innovation ecosystem that delivers high-impact transformational research, business use applications, AI-first start-ups, support employability and social good use cases. We are poised to accelerate Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic development through a solution-oriented application of machine learning in solving social/business problems. Data Science Nigeria (DSN) non-profit has been in the forefront of data and data science skills acquisition in Nigeria.\n\nDSN runs a broad-based capacity intervention across Nigeria with broader beneficiary base through its free trainings (kids, pre-university students, professionals and business executives across states in Nigeria). These initiatives are in line with Data Science Nigeria\u2019s vision and commitment to raising one million AI talents in 10 years and thus position Nigeria as one of the top 10 AI talent/knowledge destinations with 20% GDP multiplier impact.\n\nAbout the Mastercard Foundation\n\nThe Mastercard Foundation works with visionary organizations to enable young people in Africa and in Indigenous communities in Canada to access dignified and fulfilling work. It is one of the largest, private foundations in the world with a mission to advance learning and promote financial inclusion to create an inclusive and equitable world. The Foundation was created by Mastercard in 2006 as an independent organization with its own Board of Directors and management.\n\nFor more information on the Foundation, please visit: www.mastercardfdn.org",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

          "title": "Uber riders will now pay more for rides as the ride-hailing company increases fares by 13%",
          "text": "Ride-hailing company, Uber, has increased fares for Uber X, its economy option, by 13% in Lagos State. This means that a ride that would ordinarily cost \u20a61,000 ($2.10) now costs \u20a61,130 ($2.35). The hike in fares was revealed in an email the company sent to its drivers.\n\n\u201cAt Uber, we remain committed to providing a reliable earnings opportunity for driver-partners, as well as a reliable and affordable service for riders. With this in mind, starting 11th May 2021, we are increasing prices on UberX by about 13%,\u201d reads an excerpt from the email.\n\nRecall that on April 19, 2021, drivers on Uber and Bolt, embarked on a warning strike under the umbrella of the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA).\n\nThe drivers wanted a review of prices, noting that the high cost of providing rides should reflect in the current price structure. The drivers also agitated for a reduction in the commission charged by the companies from 25% to 10%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the increase in fare, one would imagine that the ride-hailing company plans to review the commission it charges on each ride, and also take drivers into consideration while giving discounts on rides.\n\nThis move isn\u2019t enough to tell if the strike action yielded the desired result, but this seems like a step in the right direction. While PEDPA is yet to react to this new development by Uber, it is likely that Bolt will follow in Uber\u2019s footsteps.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAre you building a startup business within Port Harcourt but struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Last week, l was in Ogida training school to see the state of the training facility and committed to helping the police refurbish the facility, which we have already started in order to make it available for your training.\n\n\u201cYou all are aware of the height of the security challenges and we quietly worked out our own response and created our own security volunteer network. Today, it has grown, doing what we expected it to do by connecting security between local communities and federal security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe governor reassured that his administration will put in place a legislation to strengthen the security network and help it discharge its responsibilities effectively.\n\n\u201cWe will put the necessary legislation in place, ensuring it doesn\u2019t conflict with the existing arrangements on ground.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNdigbo Lagos, an umbrella body of Igbo people in Lagos, has dismissed as mischievous, claims by the Special Adviser to Lagos State Government on Drainage and Water Resources, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, that some \u201cIgbo\u201d youths suspected to IPOB members, were planning to attack police stations and other public facilities in Lagos.\n\nThe group\u2019s Director of Communication and Strategy, Prince Tony Eze, in a statement on Monday, described Mr. Igbokwe\u2019s claims as not only false, but also inciting and very unfortunate.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe at Ndigbo Lagos have just listened to the video making the rounds in the Social Media today 9th May 2021. In the said video Mr. Joe Igbokwe, a Political appointee of Lagos State Government and Special Adviser Drainage and Water Resources claimed insider knowledge of a clandestine plot by some Igbo youths who he believes are IPOB members, to kill, to burn down police stations and public infrastructure in Lagos.\n\n\u201cNDIGBO LAGOS the umbrella body of all Igbo organizations in Lagos, wish to state as follows:\n\n1. That we are saddened by the claims of Mr. Igbokwe, which we believe are mischievous, false, baseless and inciting.\n\n2. That the governments of the South Eastern States of Nigeria and various security agencies in the country have initiated investigations to unravel the persons behind the killings and destruction of properties in the South East, and we believe strongly in their competence and ability to unravel the masterminds and bring them to justice.\n\n3. That as usual with such serious investigations the Police and other Security Agencies expect support through information from responsible citizens of which Joe Igbokwe being a government insider is very much aware of and in a good position to comply with.\n\n4. That rather than do this, Mr. Igbokwe irresponsibly went to town with his personal conclusions on who these perpetrators are and what evil they are planning for Lagos, notwithstanding the ongoing official investigations. This probably goes to suggest that Mr. Igbokwe knows more than the ordinary eyes could see, and should be invited by the relevant security agency to clarify his source which he claims is credible.\n\n5. That the Lagos State government had initiated and conducted investigation on what happened during the EndSars protest, and are well equipped with relevant information on the perpetrators of that heinous act.\n\n6. That the Igbos were not the cause of the Biafran war, and have no intention to engage into any acts as may suggest any intention of such in the foregoing circumstance.\n\n7. That we condemn in clear terms the killings going on all over the country, including in the South East, and sympathize with the families of officers and civilians, who have had to endure the loss of their dear ones. We pray their soul to rest perfect in the bossom of our Lord!\n\n8. We wish to reiterate that Igbo youths are NOT killers, neither are they arsonists, but are positively recognized as hardworking contributors to the development of our country. We have been victims rather than perpetrators of killings, burnings and looting in Nigeria.\n\n9. That it has become expedient for us to issue this rebuttal, in the light of the hightened tension in the country, being convinced that some malevolent minds may take advantage of Mr. Joe Igbokwe\u2019s recklessness with unsubstantiated rethorics to spread mistrust, cause disunity and escalate mischief in such manner and disguise, as may cause fingers to be wrongly pointed at the Igbos in Lagos. We therefore call on Mr. Joe Igbokwe to desist from reaching hasty conclusions, and spreading of falsehood.\n\n10. We enjoin Ndigbo across Lagos to go about their normal buisness. And should not engage in any unlawful acts that would endanger the good relationship we enjoy with the people of Lagos State.\n\n11. Finally, we want to remind Mr. Igbokwe that respect for the elderly is one of the cornerstone of Igbo values and civilized behavior. Hence, we call upon him to retrace his steps and apologize to Chief Mbazulike Amechi for the unconscionable remarks he made against him.\u201d",

          "title": "[COLUMN] Neglect COVID-19 Vaccine At Your Own Peril",
          "text": "By Ray Morphy |\n\nSince the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic back in March 2020, the virus has claimed more than 2.5 million lives globally with upwards of 113 million cases confirmed by laboratory tests (March 2021).\n\nThe pandemic has impacted almost every corner of life, causing global economies to stall, changing the way we work and interact with our loved ones, and stretching healthcare systems to the limit.\n\nGovernments around the world have been forced to implement harsh restrictions on human activity to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination is offering us all a way out of the pandemic.\n\nWithout vaccination, many scientists believe that herd immunity would not restore society to status quo. Without vaccines, fatality would be much higher than it is today. Many health experts including the WHO have echoed this fact. Without access to vaccines, strict behavioral measures may have to remain for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn Nigeria, one of the most worrisome developments on the effort of the federal government and the international community to rid the world of the coronavirus pandemic through vaccination is the refusal of many Nigerians to take the vaccine. The most disturbing is that many of those who you think are knowledgeable by virtue of their level of education are also refusing the vaccine. So many take the vaccine only because of possible sanctions, as in the case of a circular purportedly from the Katsina State government requesting that the school authorities should write names of those that failed to take COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIf the enlightened Nigerians, especially those living in the nation\u2019s capital Abuja refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine, you can imagine the situation in the rural communities across Nigeria. Something drastic may have to be done to ensure compliance or we will find ourselves\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nvulnerable like India did and is today paying a heavy price in record number of avoidable coronavirus deaths.\n\nThis newspaper reported recently that the rural communities in the six area councils of Abuja have continued to record low turnout of eligible people for COVID-19 vaccination. Programme officer, Immunisation Services in FCT, Mrs Salome Tor, described the development as unfortunate, saying there is so much apathy towards the COVID-19 vaccination. This apathy is not only among the rural folks but also among some of the elites who have bought into all manners of nonsensical conspiracy theories that stood logic on its head.\n\nWhile many are still making excuses why they should not take the jab the importance of the COVID-19 vaccination in halting the spread of the virus in the population cannot be overemphasized.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines produce protection against the disease, as a result of developing an immune response to the SARS-Cov-2 virus.\n\nDeveloping immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk of developing the illness and its consequences. This immunity helps one fight the virus if exposed.\n\nWhat is clear is that COVID-19 vaccine is necessary to achieve herd immunity through vaccination globally in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from continuing to mutate, becoming more resistant to current vaccines and causing more periods of mass fatality.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help stop the pandemic.\n\nStopping a pandemic requires using all the tools we have available. Wearing masks and social distancing help reduce chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines work with our immune system, so it will be ready to fight the virus if we are exposed. The combination of getting vaccinated and following Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recommendations to protect ourselves and others provides the best protection from COVID-19.\n\nEnding the COVID-19 pandemic will halt the growing negative impact the virus is having on education, the economy, health care and countless other activities of a functioning society. COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build protection. COVID-19 can bring upon serious, life-threatening complications, as hospitals are seeing in hundreds of patients daily in India and Venezuela among others lately. Even though it affects certain groups less seriously than others based on age, health and other factors, it is still not possible to predict how COVID-19 will affect any individual. Getting COVID-19 may offer some natural protection, known as immunity. But experts do not know how long that immunity lasts, and the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 far outweighs any benefits of natural immunity.\n\nGetting vaccinated creates an antibody response, so that the population are protected without having to experience the illness. Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are investigating. Getting infected with the COVID-19 virus is the least desirable and least safe way to develop immunity.\n\nWith what is happening in India it is obvious that the world is running out of the vaccines. The world needs more doses of the COVID-19 vaccines than it ever has for any disease in history. This, therefore, requires significant production efforts to ensure that needs are met.\n\nWhile the vaccine itself is effective, its impact will be compromised if not enough doses can be produced in a timely fashion, but the most disturbing is a situation like in Nigeria where the vaccine may be available and a significant proportion of the population refuse to take the jab.\n\nGiven our poor health system, which cannot withstand the avalanche of hospitalization being witnessed in India, government cannot afford to allow this attitude to stand.\n\nGovernment has used traditional and religious leaders to convince their followers that the vaccine is safe. President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo have also shown leadership by publicly taking the vaccine. The state governors across the country and the minister of the FCT have taken the jab to demonstrate that the vaccine is safe.\n\nSimilarly, the National Orientation Agency (NOA), the Federal Ministry of Information, and various media organisations have been running campaigns to show that the vaccine is safe. Perhaps these public enlightenment organisations should do more. However, where these efforts fail in convincing the skeptics, government may have to do the needful.\n\nIn that case those who refused to take the jab could be seen as constituting risk to public health. Government may have to wield the big stick and make it compulsory for all Nigerians and foreigners resident in Nigeria to take the jab.\n\nAluta Continua!",

          "text": "*Stakeholders seek action on Okada, others\n\n*Renewed demand for Special Status\n\nLagosians have asked the State Government to take decisive actions on some security issues to rein in what they describe as a disturbing trend.\n\nAmong others, they demanded action against what many described as the menace of commercial motorcycles, otherwise known as okada, kidnapping, armed robbery, cult clashes, and violent assaults.\n\nIt was all at a Stakeholders\u2019 Meeting on Security held at the Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja where Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and leading lights in security circles listened to a group of panelists who highlighted the state\u2019s security challenges.\n\nIn the audience were religious leaders, the Chief Judge, Justice Kazeem Alogba, military chiefs, traditional leaders, community leaders, students, unionists and members of the State Executive Council.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu listed his administration\u2019s efforts in security and assured his audience that a decisive action would be taken on commercial motorcycles, which speaker after speaker described as a getaway means for criminals.\n\nIts operators, they said, are unruly, uncouth, rude and brutal. But those who patronize them and the motorcyclists will not be left in the cold.\n\nThe government\u2019 Sanwo-Olu said, will be inaugurating next week the first and last mile buses, which will ply the routes the motorcycles are plying.\n\nBesides, those who have taken up okada riding for lack of jobs were advised to grab the opportunities in agriculture, wealth creation, poverty alleviation and other government programmes.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the meeting was convened in response to the growing threat posed by some lawless activities to the safety and security of lives in the State.\n\nThe Governor said the string of lawlessness daily witnessed from the confrontation between commercial motorcyclists and law enforcement agencies required an urgent action, stressing that the Government would be announcing reforms in transportation, which will further make changes to the parameters of motorcycle and tricycle operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have noted with dismay the fact that Okada riders are disregarding and flouting the restrictions we imposed on their activities in certain areas of the metropolis.\n\nWe have also observed with dismay, the ongoing violent confrontation by commercial motorcyclists against our law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cBased on all that we have seen and experienced in the past couple of weeks, as well as the increasing threat posed by the activities of commercial motorcycle operators to the safety and security of lives, we will be announcing further changes to the parameters of motorcycle and tricycle operations in the State in the coming days.\n\nNo society can make progress amid such haughty display of lawlessness and criminality.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said the State Government would be unveiling 500 units of First and Last Mile mini buses next week as safer alternative means of transportation in checkmating activities of Okada riders.\n\nThe Governor also made it known that the Government would fully implement the State\u2019s Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law of 2019 as amended, which will enable the Government take over and demolish abandoned buildings and construction sites turned into safe haven for hoodlums and miscreants.\n\nHe added that the State would strengthen its clean-up exercise of shanties and spots unapproved for settlement, but which had turned to hideouts for criminals.\n\nThe State Government, Sanwo-Olu said, would be recruiting more personnel into the Lagos State Neighbourhood Corps (LSNC) to boost intelligence gathering at the community level.\n\nThe Governor said the consultative meeting with the stakeholders was necessary to make the State\u2019s security strategy effective and sustainable, noting that all hands must be on deck to work with the Government in collecting, sharing and evaluating credible intelligence that would strengthen security of lives and property in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cLagos must continue to enjoy an atmosphere of peace, safety and all-encompassing security.\n\nWe are determined to arrest the current security challenges being faced in the State, and we will take every step necessary to deliver on our promises on a safe, secure and livable state.\n\nWe will also continue to communicate regularly with key stakeholders, and all the residents for updates on the progress we are making.\u201d\n\nAppraising security situation in Lagos, Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, raised alarm over rising security breaches resulting from the menace of Okada operations in the State.\n\nBetween January and early this month, Odumosu disclosed, 320 commercial motorcycles were arrested in 218 cases of criminal incidents in which 78 suspects were detained and 480 ammunition recovered.\n\nIn the same period, the Lagos police boss said Okada accounted for 83 per cent of 385 cases of avoidable fatal vehicular accidents in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe menace of Okada operators does not end with avoidable accidents. Crime reports from the field have shown that a greater percentage of crimes, ranging from armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, murder, burglary and stealing, traffic robbery to carjacking and cash snatching from bank customers, are attributable to armed hoodlums who operate on Okada.\n\n\u201cThe nuisance constituted by the Okada operators on Lagos roads has become a danger to law abiding citizens.\n\nSections of Lagos populace have come to regard commercial motorcycles as a necessary evil, it has become imperative for Government to take more drastic measures against their notoriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State Police Command strongly advises the State Government is to immediately review the current guidelines guiding the operation of Okada as a means of commercial transportation in the State and take decisive legal and administrative steps and policies that will curb their traffic, criminal and other nefarious activities in the State.\u201d\n\nThere was a panel of discussion chaired by an award-winning Television Show host, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, in which residents aired their views on the current state of security in Lagos and across the country.\n\nThe discussants expressed concerns on the security implications of allowing operations of Okada and demanded a \u2018Special Status\u2019 for Lagos as ethnic melting pot.\n\nThey also urged the Government to create economic opportunities and vocational engagement for unemployed residents to further lessen crime rates.\n\nAddressing the complaints about criminals hiding in uncompleted buildings and abandoned vehicles within communities, Vice Chairman of Lagos State Community Development Advisory Council, Mr. Rotimi Ayoku-Owolawi said the CDC was ready to support the Government and the police in identifying dark spots and lock-up markets from where criminals launch their nefarious activities.\n\nCommissioner for Information Mr. Gbenga Omotoso described the stakeholders\u2019 engagement as proactive, given a string of security breaches in the country.\n\nHe said gone were the days when citizens were at the mercy of pick pockets and amateur criminals; the contemporary crimes, he said, are being committed by armed robbers, bloodsucking bandits and daredevil gangsters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our Lagos to become an epicenter of evil and criminality,\u201d Omotoso said.\n\nAt the end of the stakeholders\u2019 meeting, a 12-point resolution was reached and agreed upon by the participants in public interest.\n\nThe resolution reads in part: \u201cAttacks on law enforcement officers and agencies should not be handled with kid gloves. Culprits must be arrested and the full weight of the law brought to bear on such persons.\n\n\u201cGovernment must take stringent measures to ban the use of Okada as means of transportation in the State; alternatives must be provided by the State Government in Agriculture, Wealth Creation, Women Affairs Empowerment programmes and others.\n\n\u201cGovernment should take control of abandoned and uncompleted buildings used as hideouts of criminals in the State immediately. The State must take control of abandoned vehicles in its nooks and crannies and seal off houses, hotels and event centres where hoodlums are found to hibernate or where arms are stored.\u201d",

It is only a part of the burial rites; nobody can tell you specifically where the Olu will be buried in the royal cemetery. The ceremony usually lasts 14 days,\u201d the source said on strict condition of anonymity.\n\nOmooba Tsola Emiko, son of the 19th Olu, is expected to actively participate in the burial rites of his predecessor, after which he would proceed on Idaneken (isolation), preparatory to his coronation as the 21st Olu.\n\nThe burial process will culminate in the symbolic destruction of the Uli-Oku (coffin house) of the late Olu at Ode-Itsekiri. It will also end the mourning period announced by Chief Johnson Amatserunleghe, the Iyatsere, at Ode-Itsekiri (Big Warri) on Easter Monday.",

          "text": "The Group of Seven intergovernmental organisation, popularly called the G7, has committed N148.062 billion (\u00a3276 million) to tackle deteriorating food security of millions of Nigerians occasioned by years of insurgency in the northeastern region of the country.\n\nThe action plan was brokered by the United Kingdom and is the first G7 action plan to help save millions of lives from famine and humanitarian crises.\n\nIn a statement on Monday by the British High Commission in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, said the UK on Wednesday coordinated a landmark commitment by G7 countries to tackle the root causes of famine and address the sharply rising numbers of people in need of lifesaving aid.\n\n\u201cThis agreement commits G7 nations to urgently provide an initial \u00a35 billion in humanitarian assistance to 42 countries one step from catastrophe or famine, with further funding to follow over the course of this year.\n\n\u201cThe initial funding includes \u00a31 billion in aid prioritised to the three countries at greatest risk \u2013Yemen, South Sudan and Nigeria \u2013 to be provided as soon as possible to save lives.\u201d\n\nThe G7 countries consist of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nBritish High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing noted that the G7 are also working together to find global solutions to global problems.\n\n\u201cI welcome the G7\u2019s commitment of \u00a3276 million for North-East Nigeria. It is vital we act now to avert further deterioration in the food security situation of millions of people affected by the conflict,\u201d Laing said in the statement.\n\n\u201cJust as the UK is working with Nigerian partners to find solutions to the crisis in the North East, the G7 are working together to find global solutions to global problems and protect those hardest hit by these challenges. Together we can shape a better future.\u201d\n\nThe triple threat of conflict, Covid-19 and climate change has meant the risk of famine is now a devastating reality many countries face. Millions of people in Yemen, South Sudan and North-East Nigeria are already in crisis.\n\nThe crisis in northeastern Nigeria is more than a decade old. According to UN OCHA, there are 8.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance there. 1.9 million people have been displaced from their homes and one million people are in areas outside humanitarian access.\n\nAbout 4.36 million people in the region are projected to be in crisis and emergency levels of food security this lean season which runs from June to August.\n\nThe UK says it is seriously concerned about the status of civilians living in inaccessible areas where over 800,000 are reaching critical levels of food insecurity and have extremely limited access to basic services such as healthcare.\n\n\u201cThis is not only about money. It is also about diplomatic action, smarter financing and more effective responses to crises,\u201d the statement read. It continued: \u201cAs well as addressing critical funding gaps, the UK and G7 committed to act earlier to avert crises, including by strengthening data and analysis to facilitate early action.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
