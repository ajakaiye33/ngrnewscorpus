          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nFollowing the spate of sexual and gender-based violence in the country and the need to curb this horrific trend, Women at Risk International Organization (WARIF) in partnership with the Joint EU-UN Spotlight Initiative as well as the Lagos State University, has developed a protocol document to foster the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence in tertiary institutions across the country.\n\nThis is also coming, following the success of two cycles of the Women at Risk International Organization (WARIF) prevention of campus sexual violence program. The organization has realized the need to develop a document that will guide not just students but also faculty and administration of these tertiary institutions on tackling the menace of campus sexual violence.\n\nThe document which has its preface written by Ms. Comfort Lamptey, the UN Country Representative to Nigeria covers prevention, response mechanisms as well as the important duties and responsibilities of management, as well as students in the prevention of sexual violence.\n\nA presentation of the document was made to the Lagos State Commissioner of Education, Mrs. Folashade Adefisayo and to the Federal Ministry of Education through its Deputy Director; Gender \u2013 Mrs Abukar Janigo who commended WARIF on the incredible work being done in the educational space.\n\nSpeaking on the importance of the document; WARIF\u2019S Founder, Dr Kemi DaSilva-Ibru stated \u201cwith the rising rate of rape and sexual violence in tertiary institutions across Nigeria, a document like this is necessary to educate students, staff and governing bodies about the steps to follow when faced with these situations.\n\nWARIF is proud to partner with the Joint EU-UN Spotlight Initiative as well as the Lagos State University School-Related Gender-Based Violence Response Team to reduce the prevalence of gender-based violence in our tertiary institutions by working directly with the student based organizations and the school authorities in adopting strategies stipulated in the protocol document and facilitating and strengthening existing mechanisms that will provide the much-needed support and safety to all students on campuses across the country.\u201d\n\nThe document was also presented to the Rector of Lagos State Polytechnic, Dr. Oluremi Nurudeen Olaleye as well as representatives of the Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education at a capacity building session hosted by WARIF in Lagos recently. The document has been shared with various tertiary institutions across the federation including the University of Lagos, Federal Technical College Lagos, the University of Abuja, Covenant University amongst others, encouraging these bodies to adopt and implement the strategies in their various institutions.\n\nThe WARIF School Related Campus Sexual Violence Protocol Document will chart a path to creating safer spaces for students in tertiary institutions through a detailed prevention mechanism and response to campus sexual violence. It also outlines the proper steps in addressing accountability and punishment for those who contravene the laws against sexual violence on campuses thereby reducing the extremely high incidence.\n\nWomen at Risk International Foundation, (WARIF) is a non-profit organization, established to raise awareness and address the prevalence of rape, sexual violence, and trafficking of young girls and women in communities across Nigeria. The foundation achieves this through the development and implementation of a series of initiatives which are impactful, measurable, and sustainable, targeting both the intervention/treatment of these affected women, as well as providing preventive measures in education and community service to reduce the high incidence.",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Josephine Agbonkhese\n\nOluwakemi Anne-Melody Areola is a woman of many parts; an Engineer, Public Relations Expert, a Tactical Social Development, Specialist and Business Support Advisor. Added to the mix, she also runs a modeling agency at the side and holds sway as CEO/ PR Consultant of Vivacity Public Relations.\n\nThe product of London Metropolitan University, UK and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), is the Special Assistant on ICT and Corporate Relations to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development. The widely-traveled Oluwakemi who turned 41 in February, marked the new age with her autobiography \u2013 40 Going on 80.\n\nIn this interview, the well-driven author, talks about her work, life in government, her aspirations and more.\n\nYou hold many portfolios, how do you combine them all ?\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to combine them all; there are some days when it feels like my head is about to explode. What makes it easier for me is the fact that I don\u2019t have family here in Nigeria. So, I have a lot of free time on my hands. I also have a to-do list that I work with so it\u2019s easier for me to tick off tasks that I have completed. I also have an amazing group of people that work with me.\n\nFrom which of these engagements do you derive greater fulfilment?\n\nI love assisting people, so putting a smile on someone\u2019s face is just it for me. Whenever I work on a project, I look to always put a smile on someone\u2019s face. My underwear shop (Vivacious) as much as it is a business I try to have as much fun as I can when marketing. It is one thing I do that I can say I let my hair down, because in all the other projects I have to be a lot more serious. I enjoy helping young people change their lives on the Glocalize events. Watching them take nuggets from my story and after the events, when they come to me for advice, it just gives me all the fulfillment I need. One of the things I also do is, pay school fees for students, I get a lot of calls from their parents praying for me and thanking me, this just gives me the greatest joy.\n\nWhat can you highlight as your biggest achievements as Special Adviser on New Media to the former Minister of Communications?\n\nIt was the setting up of social media for good governance, it happened once a year for a period of two years. What we did was to bring together social media handlers from every single MDAs in Nigeria including the state MDA\u2019s, and taught them how to use social media effectively in governance. On the first day of each event, we sensitized the top level i.e. Governors, Ministers. On the second day, we brought in trainers to train the handlers on the best way to use social media in governance.\n\nWhat is the most tricky part of being a special adviser to a Nigerian politician?\n\nIt is the fact that everybody thinks you are making a huge sum of money and they keep requesting. People also assume that I am always available and when you are not available, you come across as being rude and that too is not true. How many phone calls can I take in one day or how many whatsapp messages can I answer in one day? So, the money and time is really hard, but it is a labour of love and the reward comes from heaven.\n\nHow do you ensure that your research and recommendations do not end up as mere paper works?\n\nLuckily for me, I work with a proactive minister, so most of the things that we work on, there is always a memo that goes to him both; hard and soft copy. And every memo has recommendations and next steps which he acts on, and advises the internal ministry accordingly.\n\nWhere things are not moving as fast as it should be moving, I will normally ensure that there is a reminder memo, that contains the same next steps that were proffered in the beginning, I will then proffer new or additional next steps; because, situations might probably have evolved like a change in national circumstances; anything might have altered the initial memo. But I have been lucky to have a very proactive minister. Every time you say or give something to him as long as he\u2019s okay with it, it is going to fly.\n\nHow do you successfully brand a public officer who grossly under-performs?\n\nI like the word under performs. I don\u2019t think anybody is completely useless. Do a SWOT analysis of who you are working with, to understand them a lot better. Try to block all the leakages and any area of weakness, find how you can assist them in getting somebody that is strong in that aspect. So, it is good when you have somebody who even when he is under performing, he is still ready to listen.\n\nBut if you are faced with someone that is under performing and not ready to listen, focus on amplifying the good works. That way, the general public is still positioned to gain something from him. When he goes, they will still have one thing that can stand as a legacy for him.\n\nYou\u2019ve just clocked 41; what has life taught you these past 41 years?\n\nThe biggest lesson life has taught me is to put God first over everything. I would be dead today without God. God is my source and every other person is a vessel He uses. If anything happens to those vessels, your source can never cease to exist. It doesn\u2019t mean you need to be fanatical about it, it just means he needs to reside in your heart, and to be involved in everything you do.\n\nYou may make mistakes, you may take the wrong turn, but you will always get back on the right path because God is your source. Never make anybody your alpha and omega. Nobody is more significant or important than God and with God comes humility.\n\nBriefly, tell us about your recently released auto-biography?\n\nMy book, 40 Going on 80 is a book I actually wrote this year, to reflect on what I have been through, what I am going through, and what I am going to go through. It was time to tell a little bit of my story and some of the things that shaped me.\n\nI was born with a silver spoon and privileged for which I bless God. But my boss always says that we can only create opportunities and it is left for you to tap into them. I have seen an opportunity and I want to utilise it to the best of my ability, so that the universe can conspire to give me back as much as I deserve. So, I needed to tell people a little bit about my journey and my struggles.\n\nHolding two portfolios with the erstwhile Minister of Communications and now, the Minister of Youths and Sports, didn\u2019t happen because I am from Oyo or because a family member introduced me to the minister. It happened because I volunteered for an event, I was because of hard work\n\nMy book is more about telling my story, telling people that it is not luck, it is not beauty, it is not nepotism, it is none of these things that got me to where I am today. I just hope that my story inspires someone not to give up; because it is not about light being at the end of the tunnel, there is light inside that tunnel, you just need to find it. My book is about trying to help people find the light while they are inside the tunnel.\n\nIf you were to start all over again, what would you be doing differently?\n\nI really wished I went to school more, I am still trying to get my Ph.D now. I would have loved to have five degrees; one in Psychology, one in Engineering, one in Mathematics, one in English Language and one in International Relations. I am someone that loves learning but now, I think I am a bit too tired, and too old to learn. I am going to finish that Ph.D by his grace but I wished I studied a lot more and got more accolades or certificates to my name when I was younger and be at a top position in the World Bank at the age of 23. That would have been fantastic.\n\nI am not so sure about marriage; I would have preferred to be married when I was younger. I am too aware of myself now to settle for mediocre so to speak. When you are younger, you can so easily be blinded by love and even these faults you don\u2019t see them.\n\nWhen you are not working, what takes your time?\n\nI love cooking, I love reading, I really love going to a spa for a massage, and being pampered. But the truth is that, I am literally always working because I do have other things that I do, my underwear store in Abuja, my Public Relations company and a lot of other things that I am involved in, that I volunteered for, even though sometimes, it doesn\u2019t feel like work but it is work.\n\nWho inspires you locally or internationally?\n\nI have a few ladies that inspire me; Dr. Jumoke Oduwole. I admire her carriage, her poise, her charisma and for her knowledge. Michelle Obama inspires me because I like the way she is able to be a fine lady, well educated, and an amazing mother and wife. We don\u2019t see her issues come up to the surface as much as we see of many other women in the limelight. She is always wearing a smile.\n\nI also like the former Minister of Communications, Omobola Johnson. She is well spoken with good carriage\n\nCan you describe your personal style?\n\nl like to stand out but blend in. I\u2019m not really a fan of exposing parts of my body even though I do wear a lot of mini skirts. I won\u2019t expose the top region and I won\u2019t be provocative or overly different. That, for me, is blending in. I also like the boss lady style. Sometimes, I prefer maculine clothes so I\u2019m an eclectic mix of styles. I don\u2019t like to drive a female car. I prefer masculine cars. But whatever it is, let it ooze class and let it be of quality. I love clothes and fashion. So my style is as fashionable as possible.\n\nWhat is your most cherished fashion accessory? I don\u2019t think I have any, but maybe a wrist watch and bracelet I got on my birthday last year from people I cherish. I don\u2019t think I could ever throw away those accessories because I cherish the people who gave them to me.",

That, for me, is blending in. I also like the boss lady style. Sometimes, I prefer maculine clothes so I\u2019m an eclectic mix of styles. I don\u2019t like to drive a female car. I prefer masculine cars. But whatever it is, let it ooze class and let it be of quality. I love clothes and fashion. So my style is as fashionable as possible.\n\nWhat is your most cherished fashion accessory? I don\u2019t think I have any, but maybe a wrist watch and bracelet I got on my birthday last year from people I cherish. I don\u2019t think I could ever throw away those accessories because I cherish the people who gave them to me.",

          "title": "Godson Echegile : Reminiscing @ 60",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Ambassador to Sierra Leone, Godson Echegile is one of the finest political elites from Delta State, who has served the State meritoriously at local and national levels. The ex Banker and former Director of the Federal Housing Authority, who took a shot at the Delta State governorship elections in 2007 but lost, has taken a long hiatus from politics to focus on private practice.\n\nThe Chairman of Niscot Ltd., a property and estate development company, who clocked 60 recently, in this encounter, reminisces on his days of humble beginnings, the state of the nation, his support for youth leadership, amongst other life issues.\n\nYou clocked 60 recently. How does that make you feel?\n\nI am grateful to God for sparing my life; I am grateful to my family and extended family, they have been of immense support to me. I lost my mother quite early, so the extended family played a huge role in molding me and making me become who I am today. So, I give all thanks to God, to my immediate family, my three wonderful kids, my elder sisters and my other siblings.\n\nDo you feel fulfilled at 60?\n\nYes, and I thank God for life, for what I eventually became, and the height and level I have reached so far. I come from a very humble background, so I have every cause to thank God for the height he has taken me to.\n\nTalking about your background, what was growing up like for you, where were you born?\n\nI was born in Owa-Alero in Ika North Local Government Area of Delta State. I lived with my uncle for the greater part of my youth, and then went to secondary school in Imade College in Owo in Ondo State.\n\nI worked for a while before going to Adeyemi College of Education where I studied Physics/ Mathematics but I didn\u2019t teach as soon as I left Adeyemi because I got admitted to University of Lagos to study Natural Science. I graduated with a first class. In 1986, I started my banking career with Nigeria International Bank known as City Bank today. I retired from banking in 1996 as Executive Director.\n\nWith the same bank?\n\nNo, I went through many banks. I joined politics a bit early, in 1998 served as special adviser to Chief Tony Anenih, from there I went to Federal Housing Authority as Executive Director ( finance). I left the Federal Housing Authority in 2005 to try my luck at the governorship race in Delta State. It was after that race that I got appointed as Nigerian Ambassador to Sierra Leone by President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nI came back from that assignment in January 2012 and I have been on my own as a private sector person.\n\nAs High Commissioner in Sierra Leone, what was the experience like?\n\nMy diplomatic experience was quite good for me. First of all, I served in the Republic of Sierra Leone and that is where the first University in West Africa, Fourah-Bay College is located. When I look at their war spanning almost 11-12 years, which was not a pleasant one, I thank God for Nigeria that we are still here together today.\n\nWere you there during that period?\n\nNo, it was immediately the war was ending that I was appointed, I came in during the peace negotiations. While there, one thing I noticed is that Nigerians are very hard working, we are very committed with the drive to succeed. Anywhere in Africa you meet a Nigerian, other Africans get scared of them because we will take over their businesses. So that strength and drive in us as a people is what should not make us lose hope, that is one positive thing about Nigeria.\n\nSo, the ability to wield a multicultural society together is one thing that we need to do. To me, it is the challenge we have. The moment we succeed in doing that, the sky is our limit. We can learn from the Singaporean experience, where the Indians and Chinese live in one country. They have been able to wield themselves together under one leadership. So if we get it right; we have the size, the population that is our strength, so let\u2019s work on the disunity in our land and we will grow from there.\n\nHow would you describe the relationship between Nigeria and Sierra Leone?\n\nVery cordially, Nigeria brought peace to Sierra Leone and they have so much regards for us. It is a small country, barely the size of Delta State. Nigeria is like the big brother, always there to help in the spirit of ECOWAS, because the peace of Sierra Leone is peace of Nigeria. Remember when they had that crisis, we had to send our military there; a lot of resources went into bringing peace in Sierra Leone and Liberia. We had to work together to make it right.\n\nIn terms of tourism how would you compare both countries?\n\nNigeria is way ahead, but we are far behind East African countries. I go to Rwanda and Southern African countries regularly on consultancy and those ones are prepared for tourism. We are not, but because of our resources, we can afford to have five star hotels and accommodate people; that is what is lacking in Sierra Leone. They don\u2019t have that much hotel and the capacity to build places like the Eko Hotel but we have it all. All we need is security then people will come.\n\nSo you think Insecurity is responsible for the bad economy we are experiencing today?\n\nInsecurity is the reason for the bad economy. Most foreign investors won\u2019t come and invest, even Nigerians who have their money outside won\u2019t bring it in. Again, we can see that the purchasing power of the Naira is going down daily; so, we have so much to work on. But as a nation that is just 61 years of nationhood, there is still light at the end of the tunnel. The challenge is quite much but, I think we can get it right; we shouldn\u2019t lose hope as a nation. We will wake up one day and get the right leadership, that will refocus the society, and then move us in the right direction.\n\nThe government should work on uniting the country, and get our security right and all things will fall into place.\n\nYou studied Natural Science at the University of Lagos, what informed your choice of career as a tenager?\n\nI loved mathematics and so I wanted where I could express myself. If you remember in the 80s, banking was beginning to move from the \u201ctally number\u201d process to a more sophisticated level. That attracted me to banking as well as the dress code- suit! After my first degree in Natural Science, I had MSc finance, then MBA in management all from University of Lagos.\n\nWhat events in life would you say influenced you as a person?\n\nTwo things played a major role; the death of my uncle (my mother\u2019s immediate younger brother who brought me up in the 70s), and the death of my wife in 2016. She died of breast cancer. Those were very low moments for me. By September this year, it will be five years. I have remained unmarried, more or less married to the kids and they are my strength. I derive a lot of joy seeing, relating and sharing their thoughts with them. I just have three of them, two girls and a boy.\n\nHow did you cope after the loss of your wife?\n\nI have always been close to my children and they have been wonderful children. Her death was a rude shock to the family, I had to provide a shoulder on which the three kids could lean on and to be able to communicate freely with me, share ideas and guide them right. It was shocking, it was bad but we can\u2019t question God.\n\nYou talked about leaving the corporate world for politics. What is the inspiration behind that shift?\n\nTwo people influenced my coming into politics; Ambassador Dele Cole and late Chief Tony Anenih. They were people concerned about giving service and improving the environment and community. Again, there are things you cannot do as a person no matter how wealthy you are, you need the influence of the government to change policy direction, to address some ills of society. Those were the main issues that drove me into politics.\n\nAnd when you contested for governorship, but did not get the ticket, you didn\u2019t lose hope?\n\nNo. Anybody can contest; you would either win or lose. If you lose, sometimes, the winner still comes back to you to say \u201csorry, I defeated you or sorry you lost. I love some of the ideas that you campaigned on, can you help work on that? In such a case, you still have your own part in the government to play. In such a case, it is not a complete loss.\n\nAre you looking at contesting again sometime in the future?\n\nNo. At 60 I should be an elder statesman. I hold an OFR (Order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria). I will remain a statesman to guide the younger generation, and see how far we can take the country before our exit.\n\nAre you one for youth leadership or youth for president and why?\n\nSure, the reason is that they have their own society. If you look at our population, they constitute over 60 percent of the population. At times, I want to believe we are not on the same level with them; in terms of communication, they know what they want and probably how to help the society. So, I believe they should be given the chance to grow the society the way they want to see it in 20 or 30 years time and then let some of us begin to take the back seat. To me, our president should be in his 50s, should be somebody in the bracket of 40 to 50 years.\n\nWhy?\n\nTo me at 60, you can\u2019t be as agile as you were in your 40s. Like I told you earlier, I came out with a first class; in those days, I could read a book of 300 pages in two days but now, it will take me a week or two to finish because diminishing returns have set in.\n\nAt 60, you should be tidying up and asking yourself, what will the society remember me for, and not wanting to take over the mantle of governance.\n\nSo what would you want to be remembered for?\n\nI want to be remembered as a man who stood for justice, fairness and equity.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI do a lot of sports starting from tennis, squash and swimming, that is what I do if I am not in Church. I am an active member of the Anglican Communion.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion, what are you comfortable in?\n\nI love the traditional African wear, if I am not at work that is what I wear.\n\nHow do you keep fit when it comes to staying healthy?\n\nI have a gym at home, after my daily prayers, I start my day there. When I come back from work, I retire to the gym, I put in at least one hour daily.\n\nWhat about food, do you eat healthy?\n\nI try to eat healthy. I love African food that is why you hardly see me spend more than a month or two each time I travel to Europe. I love Amala, Tuwo, I am an African.\n\nIf you want to live anywhere else, where would that be?\n\nThat will be Delta State because it is a lovely place; warm people, straight forward, we tell it the way it is. It is not as stressful as Lagos, the kind of crazy chase for money. There you are your brother\u2019s keeper, you wake up, your uncle is at your door; you sit down with him and talk heartily. So I spend my vacation more in the village than outside the country. If I am outside it\u2019s mostly for business. It is just that insecurity has reduced that.\n\nWhat is your advice for the youths who have lost hope in the country?\n\nAll is not lost; this is our rough time but, I know we will come out of it much stronger. We have done so well with democracy in the last 21 years. If the military had done half of what democracy has given us, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. Yes, we are not there yet, but we will.\n\nWhat is that one great lesson you would say life has taught you at 60?\n\nFall, pick yourself up, move on, don\u2019t weep, don\u2019t keep complaining, don\u2019t remain at that point, put yourself together, you will make it again.",

          "text": "By Blessing Olaifa, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) on Thursday warned Nigerians against sharing their phones, National Identity Number (NIN) and SIM cards with others because of the risks involved.\n\nThe Commission maintained that anybody caught in the act would be held liable for any crime committed with such sensitive information.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIts Director of Consumer Affairs Bureau, Mr. Efeosa Edehen, sounded the warnings at Garki International Market, Abuja, during a consumer conversation event organised by the NCC.\n\nThe event aimed at sensitising telecom consumers had the theme, \u201cKnow your rights and obligations as a telecom consumer\u201d.\n\nEdehen warned that Nigerians must be extremely careful with their devices so they don\u2019t fall into the hands of wrong people who would use them to commit crime and later it would be traced to the owner of the device through the NIN or SIM card.\n\nHe said: \u201cDo not help other people to link their SIM cards with your NIN. Handle your phone with care, be careful how you give your phones to other people to make calls, send texts, or use social media.\n\n\u201cYour phone carries your identity and therefore should be protected and always be with you.\n\n\u201cNote that you will be responsible for whatever wrong/offence someone else committed while using your SIM card(s). So, be very vigilant.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a citizen, it is very important and necessary to register for National Identity Number (NIN) and to ensure your NIN is linked to your SIM cards,\u201d Edehen added.\n\nHE said: \u201cConsumers have the right to receive clear and complete terms and conditions for service agreement and disclosures of price for goods and services, and to affirmatively accept all terms and conditions before being charged for services.

          "title": "As abduction of undergraduates spreads across states: Parents, students in panic mode",
          "text": "By Vivian Onyebukwa, Chioma Okezie-Okeh, Oluseye Ojo, Lawrence Enyoghasu, Okey Sampson And Pelumi Adewale\n\nMany parents and guardians of students in tertiary institutions in the southern states of the country are currently gripped by fear, following the seeming spread of abductions of students to the southern part of the country.\n\nAbduction of students by gunmen in the country gained global attention in 2014 when 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped in Chibok, Borno States by Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nThere has been a gradual increase in recent times, as criminal elements have turned campuses across the country into unsafe haven for hapless students.\n\nSome of the most recent abductions are those of the 22 students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, on April 20, and two Abia State University students last Wednesday. In the Kaduna State incident, five of the abducted students were killed by their captors. Worried by the unfolding ugly development, many stakeholders, including eminent Nigerians have voiced their concerns over the issue urging government to quickly do the needful to avert the situation from degenerating into a state of anarchy.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, decried the rising spate at which students are being kidnapped, apart from other forms of criminality across Nigeria.\n\nThe first-class monarch noted that kidnapping for ransom has become one of the most lucrative businesses in the country. He however warned that if pragmatic steps are not taken by the government to holistically tackle insecurity, especially banditry, kidnapping and insurgency, total anarchy might descend on the country soon.\n\nThe monarch who spoke through his Personal Assistant/Director of Public Affairs, Mr. Adeola Oloko, noted that people still have a lot of respect for religious leaders. He implored government to engage religious leaders to talk to the adherents of their religions on the danger and evil of banditry, kidnapping and insurgency. Mr. Donatus Onyenanu who has two children in Abia State University, implored government to take urgent actions so stem the ugly tide, warning that failure to do so on time portends grave danger for the education sector.\n\nOn his part, Mr Grace Alozie whose son is a student of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, called on government to shut down boarding schools till the security situation in the country is better.\n\n\u201cParents should withdraw their children from schools until security is stable in this country. They should register in any nearby school until security is stable. And night movement should be stopped; evening and late lectures should stop. My son is now a day student. I don\u2019t care that I am spending more to transport him from my sister\u2019s house to school.\u201d\n\nAnother concerned parent in Imo said her kid\u2019s school was shut down after the attack on the states police headquarters and correctional facilities.\n\n\u201cI believe the school, which is a missionary college, will know the best time to allow our children to go back. I am not worried because she is at home. We will continue to pray that things will get better. I will never allow my child to go back to school if the attack continues.\u201d\n\nMrs Ibirogba Omolola, a mother of two said: \u201cWe are calling on the government to find something to do about this issue of kidnapping in Nigeria. When I heard the case of the kidnapped students in Abia, my heart dropped, I couldn\u2019t even imagine something like that happening. The annoying thing is we get little or no response at all from the government. The Federal Government should really do something about the security of this nation because it is getting too much.\u201d\n\nA student of Abia State University, Ngozi Okoro, expressed fears over the recent situation in the country. She told Saturday Sun that instead of her to go through hell in the hands of bandits and kidnappers, she would rather remain at home.\u201d\n\nNora Chiemerem, a Masters Degree Student of Music Department, University of Nsukka, Nigeria on his part noted: \u201cWe only travel in groups if we have to travel. There is fear everywhere now. There are many things to do outside this place but with what you told me about the Abia abduction, I didn\u2019t think I would dare to travel now.\u201d\n\nOmidiji Oladeinde, a former student of University of Ibadan, decried the general insecurity in the country. \u201cI will suggest a temporary closing down of the universities in the regions that have high record of kidnapping cases. I fear the situation will keep increasing if the government fails to take a major step soon\u201d\n\nAnother student, Chukuwemeka Chidinma, said: \u201cKnowing that kidnapping of university students is very rampant now, it is so scary going to class and coming back now. Most students just stay in their rooms now. We are currently living in fear because I attend the Federal University of Technology, Owerri in Imo State, and Abia State is really not far from here. Only God can help us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, abductors of the kidnapped students of Abia State University, Uturu have contacted the parents of their victim and demanded for ransom.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof Onyemachi Ogbulu while addressing journalists in Umuahia.\n\nGunmen on Wednesday evening abducted some students of ABSU moving from Uturu to Okigwe with other passengers.\n\nTwo of the students were said to have managed to escape from their abductors.\n\nAddressing journalists in Umuahia, Prof Ogbulu said contrary to speculations that scores of students of the institution were abducted, it was only one student that was kidnapped as the two other students escaped.\n\nHe said the abductors had contacted the parents of their victim and demanded ransom. He refused to disclose the amount they demanded.\n\nThe Vice Chancellor said the University, working in consonance with Abia and Imo states Governments would ensure the immediate and unconditional release of the student and others abducted along side him.\n\nWhile assuring that the University is safe, Prof Ogbulu said security in and around the institution has been beefed up to forestall future occurrence of the incident.\n\nHe commended Gov Okezie Ikpeazu for government\u2019s prompt response in addressing the challenge and warned criminal elements to keep away from the University as security has been put on red alert to ensure protection of lives and property of innocent citizens.",

The alleged movement of the bandits caused a stir in the FCT forcing many schools in Bwari to be hurriedly shutdown, with messages sent to parents to pick up their wards from hostels in the area.\n\nA private university owned by the Catholic Church, Veritas, and a polytechnic located close to Bwari have all shutdown and students ordered to go home.\n\nActing Secretary of Education for the FCT, Leramoh Abdulrazaq, assured that security measures have been put in place to ensure the safety of schools.\n\n\u201cThe police, Department of State Security, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, air force, and even the army, as we speak, are in schools that are in session to ensure adequate security,\u201d he said.\n\nBut residents of the attack prone communities appear not to take Abdulrazaq assurances seriously as it was learnt that some parents in the area have refused to send their children to school, pending when security situation would improve.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that residents are taking extra steps to boost their personal security.

          "text": "Obinna Chima with agency report\n\nTwo Nigerian lenders \u2013 Zenith Bank Plc and Access Bank Plc \u2013 are among the list of financial institutions from Africa and the Middle East that have indicated an interest in the acquisition of Union Bank Plc and other African assets of Atlas Mara Group, a Pan-African banking group.\n\nBloomberg which disclosed this quoted sources familiar with the matter to have disclosed that Atlas Mara Limited, the London Stock Exchange-listed pan-African banking group started by Mr. Bob Diamond has received a number of approaches for its 49.97 per cent holding in Lagos-based Union Bank of Nigeria.\n\nZenith Bank Plc and Access Bank Plc are among the suitors that have expressed interest alongside other African rivals such as Morocco\u2019s Attijariwafa Bank, the sources said.\n\nTHISDAY also confirmed the development from sources in the two tier-1 banks, who also pleaded to remain anonymous.\n\nMiddle Eastern banks and private equity suitors have also shown interest, according to the sources. Some potential buyers have indicated that they may acquire all of Atlas Mara\u2019s remaining assets in Africa, which would include its Zimbabwe unit, they said.\n\nAtlas Mara has been working with Rothschild & Co. to consider options for its Union Bank stake. No final decisions have been made, and there\u2019s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for Atlas Mara and Zenith Bank didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Attijariwafa Bank Managing Director Ismail Douiri and a representative for Access Bank declined to comment.\n\nA deal could bring down the curtain on Atlas Mara\u2019s African foray after Diamond, a former Barclays Plc chief executive officer, misjudged competition on the continent and overpaid for acquisitions. The company said recently that it\u2019s secured regulatory approval for the sales of its businesses in Botswana and Mozambique and received interest in other assets, without elaborating.\n\nAtlas Mara also said it completed a planned restructuring process and extended a standstill agreement with its creditors to May 17 to complete the necessary documentation. It\u2019s still in legal disputes with two creditors, TLG and Norsad, it added.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the need to reposition the company, which has seen a plunge of about 96% in its stock since it started trading toward the end of 2013. The firm\u2019s stake in UBN, Nigeria\u2019s sixth-biggest bank by market value is its largest investment and seen as a foothold into the continent\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Frontier and Sub-saharan Africa Banks\u2019 Analyst, Renaissance Capital, Adesoji Solanke, wrote in a note made available to THISDAY yesterday: \u201cGood for Atlas Mara if they\u2019re able to exit successfully, as they\u2019ve been selling a bunch of assets over the past year, to KCB and Access Bank respectively across different markets. Whether they get a good valuation for Union Bank is another thing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a transformational deal for Access or Zenith (Return-on-Equity dilutive for both), but could be a good way for the Middle Eastern banks to get a decent foothold in the market. We suspect getting the other private equity investor block to sell will be critical as we wouldn\u2019t expect a strategic bank investor to desire a minority shareholding.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist on implementation of full financial autonomy for judiciary, legislature\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThere seems to be no end in sight for the industrial action by the judiciary and legislative workers pressing for the full implementation of financial autonomy for the two arms of government in states as they have vowed not to compromise on their demands for the implementation of the 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThe workers, who have been on strike for about one month, said yesterday at a meeting with a federal government team, led by Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that the issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries was the constitutional provision that did not warrant any negotiation with governors.\n\nThe national leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) also insisted that the governors must fully implement financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation as guaranteed by the constitution before the current strike will be called off.\n\nBut the federal government pleaded with the unions to consider the efforts being made to resolve the dispute and suspend their strike to enable courts and legislative houses to reopen.\n\nNgige said yesterday in Abuja that progress had been made on about 90 per cent of the issues in dispute.\n\nHowever, the meeting between the federal government team and the leadership of the unions ended last night with an agreement that the unions should go and study the government\u2019s proposal, while the meeting reconvenes next week.\n\nBut earlier, during the opening of talks with the federal government team and representatives of the governors, the Deputy Chairman of JUSUN, Mr. Emmanuel Abioye, said the unions still maintained their stance on the full implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislative arms of government in the states.\n\nAbioye, while responding to the minister\u2019s address, said: \u201cI am happy that when you were talking, you said it is a constitutional issue and so since it is a constitutional issue, I don\u2019t think we should negotiate on it. We are trying to avoid someone somewhere coming to challenge the constitution one day. So, anything short of this is not why we are here.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of PASAN, Mr. Mohammed Usman, said the meeting availed them the opportunity to receive the fresh proposals by the governors, adding that the unions resolved to present the proposals to their national executive committees.\n\nHe stated that the unions would be reporting their decisions to the government at another meeting next Tuesday, adding that the strike will continue.\n\nAccording to him, the governors only agreed to shift ground on the issue of ceding money for capital projects to the two arms of government.\n\n\u201cAside from the ceding of capital projects, there is nothing new in the governors\u2019 position. However, we are happy that the federal government has opened negotiations on the matter but we will not suspend the strike until there is agreement on the implementation of full autonomy,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige, however, asked the workers to suspend the strike.\n\nWhile welcoming the parties to the resumed negotiations, the minister said about 90 per cent progress had been achieved in harmonising issues with the governors.\n\nNgige expressed optimism that the strike would soon end.\n\nHe said the government side had made offers to the two unions for them to consult with their various National Executive Committees and revert back.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of work went into the proposal given by the government side to the two unions, which substantially addressed their demands for judicial and legislative autonomy in the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe minister stated that the proposal was produced by the committee of the government side, comprising the Solicitor-General of the Federation and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. Dayo Apata (SAN); the Secretary of the Presidential Committee for the Implementation of Judicial and Legislative Autonomy, Senator Ita Enang; representative of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the Director-General of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF).\n\nNgige said: \u201cA lot of work went in. We have exchanged briefs with the JUSUN and PASAN. They have their demands, which they had earlier submitted. The government side has given counter offers and properly addressed the burning issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe stated that questions were asked and answered, while observations were made and explained, working on the proposal given by the government side.\n\nNgige said the meeting had been adjourned with a view to enable JUSUN and PASAN to take back the government proposal to their members for consideration.\n\n\u201cWe expect them to work on the documents from tomorrow and if they are satisfied, they should inform us. And you know that when they are satisfied, the logical thing is to call off the industrial dispute. So, we are to receive their views on the government offer by Tuesday morning,\u201d he added.\n\nNgige said the discussions were fruitful, adding that they have moved from the initial position of ground zero, to ground 85.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the striking workers to return to work to enable the government to meet the remaining part of their demands.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do this when the legislatures are closed in various states. We cannot also operationalise them when the courts are closed and heads of courts are not allowed into the courts or their offices.\n\n\u201cWe have made documentation and statistics for the state Houses of Assembly to make appropriate laws. So, we plead that you open the courts and state Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cBesides, we are menaced by bandits, terrorists and arsonists. With the courts closed, the police cannot tackle insecurity,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Eta Enang, who also spoke at the opening talks with representatives of JUSUN and PASAN, said the suspension of the strike had become necessary to enable the legislatures to pass legislation needed to ensure the smooth implementation of the financial autonomy.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to JUSUN and PASAN that we did not undertake all these efforts in vain and that when we arrive at a certain decision at the end of the technical session, you will be able to hit the ground running. We plead that you call off the strike because we will not be able to pass the necessary laws if the legislative houses remain closed,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, from the engagement so far with the governors, he believed that the gap was being closed.\n\nEnang stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had told the governors to do what was right to the judiciaries and legislatures in their states just as was being done at the federal level.\n\n\u201cThe president is saying to the governors, go and treat the state legislature and judiciary arms the same way we treat the National Assembly and the judiciary at the federal level,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the outcome of the meeting, Abioye said they were going back to meet with their National Executive Committees to study the situation and consider the offers made before reverting back to Ngige.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: NIN Registration Essential for Winning War against Insecurity",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday described National Identification Number (NIN) registration by Nigerians as key to win the ongoing war against insecurity.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Nigerians to fully participate in the ongoing synchronisation of NIN with SIM cards as it will provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy.\n\nThe president, at the launch of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in Nigerian Telecoms Sector and Revised National Identity Policy for SIM Cards registration at the State House, Abuja said proper identification of all Nigerians and legal residents in the country and the ability to conveniently access a database would provide the impetus for more effective planning and security oversight.\n\nHe assured the nation that his administration is fully committed to the safety of Nigerians, adding that linking the SIM to NIN will significantly enhance security, aid national planning and budget preparations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NIN will cover one of the weaknesses in our security structure. We will be able to easily identify and know the personality of Nigerians. We will identify people easily, including the crooks.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration was timely as it would support efforts to enhance security and develop the economy.\n\n\u201cThe National Identification Number is the foundational digital ID for the country; both Nigerian citizens and legal residents are expected to obtain the NIN. It will provide access to government services and will give government useful insights that will enable us to utilize scarce resources in a more efficient way,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that the first National SIM Policy was launched in February 2020, and the revised policies align with the objectives of the administration in the areas of economic development, security and anti-corruption.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe digital economy sector has made significant progress and recorded a number of unprecedented achievements since we expanded the mandate of the Ministry of Communications to include the digital economy mandate.\n\n\u201cThe Information and Communications Technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the Report by the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\u201cThe sector\u2019s 14.70 per cent double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest-growing sector of Q4 2020, ICT Sector which had a growth rate of 3.42 per cent. This is truly commendable.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the digital economy sector provided online options for activities hitherto restricted to offline channels, while minimising the disruption to activities of both public and private sectors, and reducing the cost of meetings.\n\nHe also said the National Policy for Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector was in line with the administration\u2019s commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians become active participants in the different sectors of the economy, including the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe federal government embraced institutionalising online meetings through the approval of the national policy on virtual engagements in federal public institutions. As a result of this, we now have virtual Federal Executive Council, virtual Council of State and virtual National Economic Council meetings, among others, even though this development was triggered by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our desire to produce what we eat, and consume what we produce, is not limited to the literal meaning; rather we want to work towards being self-sufficient in every sector of the economy. For the telecom sector, we want Nigerians to play a major role in the design and manufacture of devices, in meeting the manpower requirements and in becoming an active part of the telecommunications ecosystem of the country.\n\n\u201cThe policy aims to achieve this and I have earlier directed the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, to develop the structure for its implementation and forward this to the Nigerian Communications Commission to implement. We are confident that the execution of the policy will further enhance our economy and lead to the creation of jobs,\u2019\u2019 the president added.\n\nBuhari said there had been many futile attempts to promote the use of digital identity in the past.\n\n\u201cPrevious attempts have been unsuccessful due to a number of reasons, including sabotage. Our focused approach shows that this administration is dedicated to ensuring that we derive the benefits of a secure and robust digital identity system,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Pantami had appreciated the president for the continuous support to the telecoms sector, including regulators and operators, thanking him for the keen interest in ensuring that the security sector gets a boost with more information on Nigerians and legal residents.\n\nAccording to him, NIN Registration has recorded a huge success with 54 million Nigerians already captured in the process, with over 12 million of them enrolled within six months.\n\nHe said it was now possible to have virtual ID cards that could be used in various transactions, adding that the NIN and SIM card registration for Nigerians and legal residents will cover 99.9 per cent of the target audience.\n\nPantami stated that the buoyancy of the telecoms sector has given Nigeria many leadership roles in international organisations, listing the impact on education, training, health and welfare of many, including the establishment of 600 computer centres, and a world class SIM card manufacturing company sited in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A former Senator in the 8th Senate, Senator Shehu Sani, has said the agitation for the breakup of the country by various interest groups was fuelled by systemic injustice and impunity by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\nSani added that the Indigenous People of Biafra\u2019s leader, Nnamdi Kanu, and the Oduduwa Republic agitator, Sunday Igboho, were once believers in one Nigeria before the government became bad, irresponsible and divisive.\n\nShehu Sani\n\nThe Senator said as long as poverty, corruption and bad governance continued to grow and failure of government became apparent, the bandits and terrorists ravaging the country would also not drop their arms.\n\nHe stated these on Thursday in Abuja at a symposium titled, \u201cMinimum wage, Unresolved National Question and Insecurity In Nigeria\u201d organised by the Movement for a Socialist Alternative, Take It Back Movement, the Committee for Defence of Human Rights, the Socialist Party of Nigeria and the Democratic Socialist Movement, among others.\n\nSani said those calling for the breakup of the country were once patriots and nationalists who believed in Nigeria but could not bear the gross injustice in the system therefore resorted to agitation for self-determination.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe revolts and storms you see in this country today are reaping from what has been sown by the Nigerian political class. As poverty continues to grow and failure of government becomes apparent, you will not see bandits or terrorists dropping their arms; you will rather see people moving to the other side of the divide.\n\n\u201cInsecurity is not only a threat to the existence of the people but today one of the most important factors that is precipitating the agitation for the breakup of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am a believer in the unity of Nigeria and unity of Africa as a state (the United States of Africa). But there is a need for us to ask ourselves; most of the persons who today have become the face of separatism and breakup of Nigeria were once nationalists and patriots who believed in this country.\n\n\u201cFrom IPOB to Oduduwa group, from Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho, they were believers in Nigeria. What went wrong? That is the question we should ask ourselves. Today the military is more interested in constructing event centres, shopping malls, universities and commissioning housing schemes. You can hardly see a policeman with a weapon without a tape. Sometimes, you will ask if the paper tape was part of Nigerian weapon system. This is how low things have become.\u201d\n\nHe berated the Minister of Finance and federal government for not being able to justify how the sum of N1.08 trillion released to the Nigerian military within 28 months was utilised.\n\nThe Senator said it was laughable for a country to invest such an amount of money on security agents and still find it difficult to locate and rescue 30 abducted students in 55 days.\n\n\"Today in my own part of the country, the northwestern part of the country, bandits have become more than the authority and a state to themselves. Almost 60 to 70 percent in Niger State senatorial constituencies have been wiped out by bandits.\n\n\u201cThey kill, they terrorise and displace people from their ancestral lands or they give you conditions of living under their authority and command. This is how the state has regressed and this is how the government has abandoned its people,\u201d Sani added.",

The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG),\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the case of the Sinopharm vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility. The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings. It is the also first vaccine that will carry a vaccine vial monitor, a small sticker on the vaccine vials that change color as the vaccine is exposed to heat, letting health workers know whether the vaccine can be safely used.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined.\n\n\u201cFew older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because preliminary data and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.\n\n\u201cThere is no theoretical reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO therefore recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to make the recommendation more robust.\u201d",

This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, has launched a policy that may see Nigerian startups enjoy more government ICT contracts.\n\nOn Thursday, May 6, 2021, the Nigerian Federal Government officially launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector. It also launched the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.\n\nThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration reiterated the mandatory use of NIN for all sim registration\n\nThe National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector is in line with the eighth pillar in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) Document unveiled in November 2019 by the President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eighth pillar, titled \u201cIndigenous Content Development and Adoption\u201d, is to provide a policy framework to identify jobs that are currently being outsourced and support the repatriation of these jobs to digitally skilled Nigerians.\n\nOne of the implementation strategies of the pillar states that the government will increase the patronage of digital startups, enabling them to access a minimum percentage of government-funded jobs.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the Nigerian government is not known to give its ICT contracts to Nigerian startups. A notice on the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) website in 2017 called for interested bidders to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to build a secure e-ticketing system on an investment basis.\n\nOne of the eligibility criteria listed on the notice mandates companies to have \u201cverifiable evidence of financial capability with an average annual turnover of not less than \u20a61 billion ($2.8 million) in the last three years (2014, 2015, and 2016).\u201d A most unrealistic criterion likely to marginalise small Nigerian startups and ICT companies.\n\nA more recent example is the Lagos unified Internet Fibre Infrastructure Project begun in 2020. Local Industry experts revealed that details of the project were unclear regarding the future of fibre infrastructure in Lagos State.\n\nHowever, as we reported in 2020, the Ekiti State Government partnered with on-demand mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), to digitise operations of commercial motorcycles (Okada) and tricycles (Keke). The startup was to introduce digital technology to aid the project.\n\nWhile the new policy might pave the way for government patronage of Nigerian startups, it remains to be seen, given history, how well the policy would be implemented.

We have been in touch with the police headquarters and agreed that Edo State Government will intervene in upgrading and improving the training facility and make it available for training the policemen and other members of the security architecture in the State.\n\n\u201cWe are redesigning the security architecture for the state and it will enable us to have a permanent training facility for about five or six squads at a time, made up of fifty men in each squad.\n\n\u201cThey will be equipped with introductory training in security, intermediate and advanced training as well in different levels. It can\u2019t happen with the facility in a state of disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come in to do an evaluation and assessment ourselves. The clinic needs to be rehabilitated and re-equipped and the hostels need to be rebuilt and re-equipped for decent habitation. The classroom needs to be rebuilt and the training ground and the obstacles need to be upgraded and repaired,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor further noted that \u201cthe state government is concerned about the state of the security system and cannot leave it for the Federal Government alone. Security is everybody\u2019s concern and as a state government, we have decided to put our money where our mouth is and use what we have to try and solve our problem\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Police Commissioner said that \u201cas a Force, we are happy that this facility is going to be upgraded by the Edo State Government.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state. I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "text": "BY BODE GBADEBO and MUYIWA OYINLOLA, Abuja |\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), have refuted a media report suggesting that Lawan and the APC caretaker committee chairman and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, are at war over the 2023 presidency.\n\nBoth the Senate President and the Yobe State governor described the report as laughable.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cthe laughable claim of bickering between the Senate President and Yobe Governor only exists in the imagination of the reporter and his pay master.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the office of the president of the Senate described the said report as comical and a mere concoction of a reporter who has no regard for facts or fidelity to truth.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, the special adviser on media to Senate president, Ola Awoniyi, said it is disappointing that it was the second time in less than 10 months that they are compelled to issue a rebuttal of a baseless story published by the same newspaper.\n\nDescribing the report as outright falsehood and the handiwork of mischief makers, Awoniyi urged Nigerians to treat it with contempt.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo start with, there is no crisis of the nature painted by the reporter in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Also, the relationship between the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, who is also the interim Chairman of APC, is cordial and has always been so.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe reporter said in the fictional report that just last week the two men were on the same flight on a condolence visit to Kano and Sokoto States. That will surprise no one who is familiar with their relationship because they are brothers.\n\n\u201cThey interact closely as leaders of APC at the national level and as leaders of the party too in their home state of Yobe. They are also political soul mates who share a primary concern to impact the lives of their people.\n\n\u201cWe understand the agony of individuals who are envious of the landmark achievements of the APC-led Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari and the growing popularity of the party across the nation. However, it is unacceptable for journalists to offer themselves and their media platforms for sowing seeds of discord in the party,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, the APC said the duo have remained good brothers in a very good relationship with a common goal of contributing to the development of their state, party and country.\n\nIn a statement by the director-general (DG), press and media affairs to the APC chairman, Mamman Mohammed, the party said it was regrettable and unimaginable that a national daily newspaper (not LEADERSHIP) could resort to junk journalism to publish a false, delusive, fallacious and misleading figment of somebody\u2019s imagination.\n\nMohammed stated: \u201cIt is also surprising that such unethical and unprofessional fabrications can be a lead story in any acclaimed national newspaper.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are conscious of the satanic plans being orchestrated by some mischievous elements to cause disaffection to distract the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee party from the onerous task of rebuilding the party and, to discredit the President Muhammadu Buhari led government.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, there is no any disagreement as a grain of wheat between their Excellencies the President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan and the Executive Governor of Yobe state who doubles as Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni.\u201d\n\nThe party further urged the media to resist any form of manipulation and stand for truth and justice at all times.",

          "text": "BY ISAIAH BENJAMIN and NONYE EKWENUGO, Kaduna\n\nThe 27 freed students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation Afaka in Kaduna State have said that although they were subjected to all manner of ill-treatment by their captors, they have all resolved to forgive them and prayed to God that they will turn a new leaf.\n\nThe students, who were kidnapped on March 11, 2021 and released on Wednesday, May 5, 2021, after spending 56 days in captivity, were reunited with their parents and families on Friday after undergoing a thorough medical checkup at the Kaduna Police clinic.\n\nAt the college premises where they were brought in in two Hilux buses accompanied by heavily armed security personnel, it was more of funfair and celebration by both the estactic parents and the released students as tears of joy rolled down uncontrollably on their cheeks.\n\nRELATED: https://leadership.ng/why-27-freed-kaduna-students-have-not-rejoin-thier-families-state-govt/\n\nRecounting her ordeal and experience in the hands of the abductors, Sarah Sunday, said: \u201cKai! A lot of things happened while we were there. We passed though hunger, we were subjected to trekking and all sorts of dehumanising things. We were insulted, but fortunately, they did not molest any of us and they did not kill any of us. They only beat us on the first day when they did a video of us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how they we were fed, Sarah said, \u201cthe boys among us used to go and fetch water for us to cook. We normally cook Tuwo with Miyan Kuka, and Tuwo with dried okro. We only cooked rice once, and we cooked Spaghetti once too.\u201d\n\nAsked whether their abductors used to leave them and go out for other operation during their captivity, she said, \u201cyes, they used to go out, but they always leave some of their armed gang members to stay with us.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEven our male colleagues that used to go and fetch water, there are those that escort them to the stream with AK47 rifles. Our living condition there in the jungle was very bad. We never had our bath. We were beaten by the rains even though there was a hut that we always run to, yet rain would still beat us inside the poorly built hut. But, we have forgiven our kidnappers. And we pray that God will give them the chance to change for the better.\u201d\n\nAnother victim, Pamela Ibrahim, said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny, it was hell. They didn\u2019t feed us, they didn\u2019t give us anything to drink. But we thank God for finally hearing our prayers and making them to free us.\n\n\u201cBefore they release us, the kidnappers told us that they don\u2019t have anything against us, that they kidnapped us because they needed the government to settle things with them, that they also want to be educated like other Nigerians, they need work, they need houses.\n\n\u201cIf government did not settle them that they would not stop, they would continue to make sure that Kaduna State is not safe. They were very serious when they said that and it made us believe that they mean it. Some of them are Nigerians some are foreigners. They spoke mainly Fulani and Hausa.\n\n\u201cThere was an old man, anytime he is with us he stopped them from harassing us, but once he is not around, they will beat us and insult us.\u201d\n\nAccording to another freed student, Zakariya Mohammed Magaji, the kidnappers\u2019 den was hell, which he would not wish for his enemies.\n\n\u201cThe bandits need prayers. All that we have to do is to pray for them for God to touch their hearts. As for me, I have forgiven them for whatever we went through in their hands, the experience was hell,\u201d Magaji said.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the parents of the freed students, Ibrahim Hassan, whose daughter was released only few days to the wedding of her elder sister, said he can now sleep well.\n\n\u201cI was confused, my life was miserable throughout the time my daughter was with the kidnappers. I only depended on God.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that some of the students of Greenfield University were killed, I became sad, thinking that I would never see my daughter again but when I learnt they have been released, my joy knew no bound especially as her elder sister\u2019s wedding comes up in Zaria tomorrow (Saturday). It is a double joy for me,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nAnother parent, Comrade Friday Sani, who was the spokesperson of the parents forum, and whose two daughters, Rejoices Sani and Victory Sani, are among the students, said, \u201cWe thank God that our children are back, we thank God for their safe arrival. We are happy that they are back safe and healthy, all that they went through is a past tense, now we are happy about the situation.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, who spoke on behalf of the Kaduna State government, said: \u201cwe will do everything that we can to enhance internal security in the state.\n\n\u201cThe primary responsibility of every government is security and also to ensure law and order. The most important thing is that the students are back and have been reunited with their families. Let them pursue their education, let it be a history that someday this is what happened to them.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address at the reunion of the released students with their parents, Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, CP Umar Muri, while commending all who played one role or the other in the release of the students, reiterated that, \u201cConcerted effort is being made to ensure the Greenfield University Students who were abducted on the 20th April, 2021 regain their freedom soon.\u201d",

Aside from that, we have done for some rural women in Ekiti State, so this is the third one and we hope to reach out to more communities within the FCT and the country at large.\n\n\u201cAlso, my staff lives among the people in Zamani village so, I decided to extend the gesture through her and to her community.\n\n\u201cIt is also part of my activities to mark by 40 years anniversary. God has been great to me and I want to share my blessings with other people.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, one of the beneficiaries, Madam Alice Adamu, said the donation was the first of its kind from someone who is not related to them in any way, to dedicate her time to assist the local women.",

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed.

          "text": "Facts have emerged on why the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Hadiza Bala Usman, was suspended.\n\nShe was accused of inability to give of the yearly remittance of operating surpluses by the NPA from from2016 to 2020\n\nAccording to Rotimi Amaechi, details she gave was \u201cfar short of the amount due for actual remittance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Amaechi letted to President Muhammadu Buhari, NPA within the stipulated years, recorded an outstanding unremitted balance of N165 billion (N165, 320, 962, 697).\n\nHe therefore suggested that the financial account of the NPA be investigated and audited. As such, Ms Usman was suspended.\n\nDocuments obtained by NEWS DIRECT revealed the correspondence between Mr Amaechi and Ibrahim Gambari, Mr Buhari\u2019s spokesperson who confirmed the president approval. The ministry in its letter signed by Magdalene Ajani, the Permanent Secretary, listed five audit firms and requested the Auditor-General\u2019s office to approve any of them for the audit. In the alternative, the ministry requested the Auditor-General\u2019s Office to grant it authority to advertise and select qualified audit firms to conduct the exercise.\n\nThe audit firms listed by the ministry include KPMG Nigeria, Deloitte Nigeria, Price Water House Coopers (PwC), Ernest and Young Nigeria, and McKinsey and Company.\n\nBut the Auditor-General, Adolphus Aghughu, in a letter dated April 16, notified the transport ministry that the NPA board had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana & Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants as external audit firms.\n\nIn the letter which he personally signed, the AG added that the said audit firms had indeed audited and published the accounts of NPA in 2016, 2017, and 2018 financial years, and the 2019 audit is ongoing. The Auditor-General added that its office had conducted periodic checks and released appropriate reports on the checks.\n\nQuoting extant laws establishing the NPA and the Nigerian constitution, the Auditor-General concluded that \u201creputable professional audit firms are already being engaged by the Board in line with the enabling Act\u201d. It added that there was \u201cno justification for the Ministry to advertise and select qualified Audit firms to conduct the exercise.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government has begun profiling towards prosecution, well-placed Nigerians suspected of being financiers of terrorism in the country.\n\nBriefing journalists on Friday in Abuja, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami said the arrest of the suspects followed the recent convictions of some Nigerians on terrorism financing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nHe said that investigations conducted have established reasonable evidence of the involvement of the highly placed individuals, businessmen and institutions across the country in financing the Boko Haram terrorists.\n\n\u201cAs you will actually know, sometimes back there were certain convictions of Nigerians allegedly involved in terrorism financing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE),\u201d he said in reaction to the extent of prosecution.\n\n\u201cThat gave rise to wider and far-reaching investigations in Nigeria and I\u2019m happy to report that arising from the wider coverage investigation that has been conducted in Nigeria, a number of people, both institutional and otherwise, were found to be culpable.\n\n\u201cI mean a reasonable ground for suspicion of terrorism financing has been established or perhaps has been proven to be in existence in respect of the transactions of certain higher-profile individuals and businessmen across the country.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Supreme Court Upholds Deregistration Of 74 Political Parties\n\nAlthough Malami declined to disclose names of the terrorist financiers nor the number of those found culpable, he simply stated that a large number of persons were involved, adding that he is not at liberty to disclose further, as investigations (which have reached an advanced stage) and profiling continue.\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m happy to report that investigation has been ongoing for a long and it has reached an advanced stage.\n\n\u201cArising from the investigation, there exists, certainly, reasonable grounds for suspicion that a lot of Nigerians, high-profile, institutional and otherwise, are involved in terrorism financing and they are being profiled for prosecution.\n\n\u201cIn essence, it is indeed true that the government is prosecuting and it\u2019s indeed initiating processes of prosecuting those high-profile individuals that are found to be financing terrorism. It is indeed true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: nobody is going to be spared, no stone will be left unturned. We shall certainly and aggressively pursue those people that are involved in terrorist financing as far as the Nigerian state is concerned,\u201d he declared.\n\nNigeria has been grappling with series of security challenges ranging from Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast to banditry in the northwest, kidnapping for ransom in several parts of the country, ritual, agitations for secession among several others.\n\nThe country has been battling insurgency for over a decade with over 36,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the northeast.\n\nAs part of measures to rejig the entire security architecture, President Muhammadu Buhari earlier this year replaced his four top military commanders in a bid to better combat the insurgency that has also displaced more than two million people from their homes since 2009.\n\nISWAP split from mainstream Boko Haram in 2016 and became a dominant group, launching attacks on military bases and ambushing troops while abducting travellers at fake checkpoints.\n\nSince 2019, the army has mostly withdrawn from villages and smaller bases into so-called \u201csuper camps\u201d, fortified garrisons meant to give better protection against attacks.\n\nBut critics say the strategy has left jihadists with more freedom to roam untouched in rural areas and made highways vulnerable to kidnappings and assaults.",

We are very open to hosting the final round.\u201d\n\nBritain has been one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic, but is currently easing restrictions following a sharp decline in cases and deaths.\n\nBut Public Health England announced Friday it had named a strain of the virus from India as a \u201cVariant of Concern\u201d after cases rose over the previous week to 520 from 202.\n\nMost cases were clustered in Bolton, northwest England, and London, with almost half linked to foreign travel.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "A federal grand jury indicted four former Minneapolis police officers on charges they violated George Floyd\u2019s civil rights, according to a three-count indictment unsealed on Friday.\n\nFloyd was killed on May 25, 2020, when former officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on the Black man\u2019s back for more than nine minutes. A jury found Chauvin guilty of three counts of unintentional murder and manslaughter in April. Chauvin has appealed and asked for a new trial.\n\nThe third count of the civil rights indictment claims that Chauvin, along with the three officers who were present as Floyd died; Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, \u201cwillfully deprived\u201d Floyd of the civil right guaranteed by the US Constitution \u201cnot to be deprived of liberty without due process of law\u201d.\n\nChauvin is charged with violating Floyd\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and unreasonable force by a police officer. Chauvin was also charged in a second indictment, stemming from the arrest and neck restraint of a 14-year-old boy in 2017.\n\nThao and Kueng are also charged with violating Floyd\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable seizure, alleging they did not intervene to stop Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck. All four officers are charged for their failure to provide Floyd with medical care.\n\nTo bring federal charges in deaths involving police, prosecutors must believe that an officer acted under the \u201ccolor of law,\u201d or government authority, and willfully deprived someone of their constitutional rights, including the right to be free from unreasonable seizures or the use of unreasonable force.\n\nThat is a high legal standard; an accident, bad judgement or simple negligence on the officer\u2019s part is not enough to support federal charges.\n\nChauvin\u2019s guilty verdict gave hope to police reform activists that the US was turning the page on what they view as impunity for killer cops.\n\nChauvin filed a request for a new trial earlier this week, citing the media frenzy surrounding his trial.",

          "text": "The Maldives police have said an explosion that wounded former President Mohamed Nasheed was an act of terrorism but no suspects were identified.\n\nNasheed, the former president and current speaker of parliament, remains in hospital after a bomb attack that left him with serious shrapnel wounds and the Indian Ocean archipelago in shock.\n\nThe 53-year-old had just left his house in the capital, Male, and was about to get into his car late on Thursday when a bomb attached to a motorbike exploded. Residents said the blast was heard across the city.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nHome Minister Imran Abdulla told local media Nasheed\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening. One of Nasheed\u2019s bodyguards was also taken to hospital.\n\nPresident Ibrahim Mohamed Solih went to the hospital where Nasheed, a close ally, is being treated and called an emergency meeting following the attack.\n\nSolih said on Friday the explosion was \u201can attack on democracy\u201d and the Maldives\u2019 tourism-dependent economy, and announced that Australian federal police investigators will arrive on Saturday to assist an investigation.\n\n\u201cNasheed escaped an assassination attempt,\u201d a Maldivian government official told AFP news agency. \u201cHe is injured, but his condition is stable.\u201d\n\nImages on social media showed a destroyed motorbike at the scene of the attack, which was cordoned off by armed police units and security forces.\n\nNasheed has been an outspoken critic of religious extremism in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, where preaching and practicing other faiths are banned by law.\n\nThe Maldives is known for its luxury resorts but has seen rare violent attacks. In 2007, a blast in a park in the capital wounded 12 foreign tourists.\n\nViolence has been blamed on a rise in religious extremism. The Maldives has one of the highest per capita numbers of militants who fought in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSolih said in a televised speech that Australian Federal Police investigators will arrive on Saturday. The Australian Federal Police said its members will engage with Maldives police and assess the assistance that can be provided to their investigation.",
