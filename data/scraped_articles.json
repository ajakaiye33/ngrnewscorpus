          "text": "Twenty-seven abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, have been released by bandits.\n\nThe Chairman of The Forum of the Abducted Parents, Malam Abdullahi Usman confirmed it to our correspondent on the telephone on Wednesday.\n\nThe elated chairman said, \u201cYes, they have been released after 50 days.\u201d\n\nOn March 11, 2021 bandits invaded the school located in Afaka along the Kaduna International Airport road and abducted 39 students.\n\nThe bandits demanded N500m as ransom for their release, but 10 of the 39 students had been released in two batches of five each.\n\nIt was learnt that the release was facilitated by the Sheikh Abubakar Gumi dialogue committee with support from former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nMeanwhile, a source told our correspondent that on the day the students were abducted, two out of the 39 escaped.\n\nHe added that in order not to put the lives of the remaining abducted students in danger, it was decided that nothing should be said about the two students that escaped.\n\nEarlier, the forum had refuted a claim by one of them that they met with the Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, who directed them to a Fulani man, Ahmad, whom they paid N800,000 to.\n\nA parent, who spoke in an interview with Root TV, had said they paid N800,000 to the said Ahmad.\n\nHowever on Wednesday, the forum dismissed the claim, saying nobody was paid any money.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u2018Re: Afaka 39: Kidnapped student\u2019s mother exposes Sheikh Gumi, reveals his role in banditry.\u2019 signed by Usman and the Secretary, Mrs Catherine Saleh, the forum said, \u201cThe woman is not a member of the committee representing the affected parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the committee representing the parents of the 39 abducted students visited Sheikh Gumi to seek his intervention for the release of our children, but he declined on the grounds that he would not want to go against the position of the state government which has forbidden anyone to negotiate with bandits.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the esteemed Sheikh for any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\u201d\n\nKaduna hails release\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, said the state rejoiced with the freed students.\n\nAruwan said, \u201cThe Kaduna State Police Command has reported to the Kaduna State Government, the release of the remaining students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation.\n\n\u201cThe government rejoices with the freed students, their families and the management of the institution over this development.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai charged them to view their ordeal as a motivator to put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead.\u201d\n\nThe students were seen at the state police command with the Commissioner of police, Umar Muri.\n\nThe students looked weak and in their night wears. They were later taken to an undisclosed hospital for medical evaluation.\n\nBuhari welcomes release of Afaka students\n\nAlso, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday welcomed the release of the students.\n\nHe also congratulated their friends, families and the government and people of Kaduna State on the development.\n\nA statement by Buhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, quoted the President as saying. \u201cWe are happy they have been released.\n\n\u201cWe express our deep appreciation to all the actors who contributed one way or the other to this happy outcome, in particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State. We thank Nigerians for their prayers.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

How can bandits be kidnapping or shooting a traditional ruler dead just like that?\n\n\u201dI believe that going traditional will curb these senseless killings and therefore not out of place.\n\n\u201cIn the days of the old, there were wars, and we had unique ways of fighting them and winning. Some people don\u2019t believe in it, because new found religions have taken over and reduced our faith in traditional power.\n\n\u201cSome traditional rulers say they can\u2019t use charms to protect themselves, this is hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cWe are custodians of tradition and not wasters. Why are we running away from our tradition? How can an Oba be killed or kidnapped like a chicken? I find it appalling and difficult to believe.\n\n\u201cIt is not only the Obas, all of us must work hard to protect ourselves. Our forebears believed in God.\n\n\u201cWhen did this insecurity start? Obas must get involved in the tradition. Now I am happy that a lot of people are going back to that time of the old to defend themselves,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "By Collins Nweze\n\nGroup Chairman, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, Tony Elumelu has called on the Federal Government to prioritise power supply to support businesses and achieve sustainable economic development.\n\nSpeaking yesterday on the ARISE News TV on economy, African development and entrepreneurship, Elumelu said Nigeria needs about 100,000 Megawatts of electricity per day to power the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery sector of our economy needs the power sector and I think we need to prioritise it more. But I commend efforts going on and also by making sure we privatise the remaining ones. The transmission lines need to be fixed and we need to make sure we improve the payment system.\u201d\n\nHe however expressed dismay that the country operates with less than 5,000 megawatts.\n\n\u201cFor the power sector to work, it must work well. If we have to drive this economy, we need to increase generation, make sure we fix gas supply to generating companies and ensure the transmission lines are utilised to evacuate the power. We also need to make sure that power generated are taken by Discos and the end users and pay,\u201d said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, power is still a critical sector requiring more investment by stakeholders to make sure that it works for sustainable economic growth.\n\nElumelu, who is also Chairman, Heirs Holdings, said Transcorp through Transcorp Power and Afam Power today in Nigeria own the highest generating capacity in Nigeria that can generate 2,000 MW of electricity a day.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we do less that 500MW at this point in time and a major constraint in this area is gas then there is the issue of transmission and there is issue the issue of payment. For this to work well for us to generate more, we need to have gas and our group has invested in oil and gas. And so, for us as a Group, it is not necessarily for oil, it is because of gas because we want to be able to ensure that we have gas from our oil and gas production to convert to electricity,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Elumelu, said: \u201cWhat some of us have advocated is that the Gencos, the Discos and the entire power stakeholders should come together and have a deal with the federal government to take over the transmission lines and it would be in our self-interest to make sure it works. We have the transmission lines that do not work so, when you are generating, there is no way you would evacuate your power. That sector is so critical and pivotal for the survival of power sector.\n\nResponding to questions on if UBA is exposed to insider trading, he said: \u201cThe oil and gas acquisition we just made, UBA did not participate in the funding. It is a club of international and local lenders. The local receiving bank for our proceeds is Union Bank of Nigeria and the international receiving bank of our oil sales is Standard Chartered Bank, London.\n\n\u201cThe transaction was funded by consortium of banks \u2013 Standard Chartered, ABSA in South Africa, Afrexim, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank in Nigeria and a host of other international banks. So, we are minded of all this and we are very prudent in making sure we do not put pressure on the bank\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also put in equity investment and when we need to get investment, we try not to put pressure on the institution. What is important is that it is within the limit UBA should be exposed to a company and it is by the way performing very well. Our loans are performing very well, \u201dhe added.\n\nElumelu said there was need to improve Nigeria\u2019s productive base and diversify its foreign exchange earning sources. He called for continued improvement on the ease of doing business and creating the right environment would enable people, businesses and entrepreneurs succeed.",

          "text": "Access Bank Group Plc\u2019s audited result showed an improvement in the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio. NPL improved from 5.80 per cent in 2019 to 4.30 per cent in 2020. The lower ratio reflected successful approach to loan recovery adopted by the Group which is fast gaining the reputation as Nigeria\u2019s toughest loan recovery machine. The bank\u2019s new investments in technology and rising commitment to Africa trade through the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) scheme are lookouts to drive its new growth phase, writes GROUP BUSINESS EDITOR, SIMEON EBULU .\n\nFor banks and other financial institutions, creating quality loans is one way of staying in business. It not only guarantees sustainable profitability, it also ensures growth of the businesses it supports.\n\nAccess Bank Plc has for years supported businesses through quality loans. The bank has also risen to the challenge whenever its loans got bad.\n\nAccess Bank has one of the toughest loan asset portfolio managers and a delinquent asset recovery team. The toughness of asset managers has enabled the bank to push its nose ahead of sector rivals concerning improved asset quality.\n\nThe group witnessed its highest NPL ratio in 2019 while 2018 advertised its lowest just before its move to merge with Diamond Bank Plc in 2019.\n\nSeveral innovations and expansion plans by Access Bank has lead to uptick in its performance in the full year 2020 financial results.\n\nAccess Bank recorded gross earnings of N764.7 billion for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, which was a 15 per cent improvement from the N666.75 billion posted for the comparative period of 2019.\n\nProfit before tax grew by 13 per cent to N125.9 billion from N111.9 billion, despite the high cost of operating the enlarged franchise and the increase in net impairment charge of nearly N43 billion arising principally from a Structured Trade Finance (STF) portfolio in the Access Bank UK.\n\nThe STF impairment is one-off/COVID related and recoverable between the next 12 and 18 months against insurance cover from world class insurers.\n\nStill, profit after tax (PAT) increased from N94.1 billion to N106 billion in 2020 due to 32 per cent rise in operating income, which offsets the rise in impairment charges and operating expenses.\n\nCustomer deposits rose by 31 per cent to N5.59 trillion in December 2020, from N4.26 trillion. Likewise, net loans and advances grew by 18 per cent to N3.61 trillion, up from N3 trillion in the previous year.\n\nThe board recommended a final dividend of 55 kobo per share bringing the total dividend to 80 kobo per share.\n\nAlso, the bank had increased recovery efforts, carrying out major write-offs and leveraged its sound risk management practices. These improved asset quality improved to 4.3 per cent, compared to its 2019 report of 5.8 per cent.\n\nBeyond the positive results delivered by the bank, it has continued to leverage its spread across the African continent and deep investment in technology to reap gains coming from the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTA).\n\nThe AfCTA trade bloc offers a potential market of over 1.3 billion people and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) size of over $3 trillion. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), there is the potential for intra-African trade to rise to 15.5 per cent as a share of total African trade by 2022 compared with 10.2 per cent from 2010.\n\nFor many businesses, securing a seat at the stable ensures that Nigerians can influence negotiations and protect national interests.\n\nWhile the agreement is not a silver bullet, due to structural barriers to trade, Group Managing Director, Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said he saw many benefits to the bank and the various African economies within the AfCTA deal.\n\nIn a report entitled: Realigning for Growth released by the bank, Wigwe said the lender would be optimising and taking maximum gain of the trade agreement by repositioning its operations and payment platforms to serve more customers across the continent.\n\nHe said Access Bank Group has consistently delivered growth and created value over time and has the largest customer base in Africa, with a significant share of digitally active clients. The bank is also becoming an aggregator in Africa by building a global payments gateway, offering holistic trade finance support and offering correspondent banking services.\n\nThe bank is also focusing on key markets to support regional trade by targeting new opportunity markets and positioning the bank as a trade and payments gateway to the world.\n\nHe identified eight African countries for a potential expansion as it seeks to benefit from the opportunities presented by the AfCFTA.\n\nThe bank already operates in 12 countries following a series of acquisitions spanning from Kenya to Nigeria. The markets of interest are Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Angola, Namibia and Ethiopia, according to an online presentation emailed by the Lagos-based lender.\n\nIt will also use its London-based unit as an \u201canchor for growth\u201d to expand representative offices in countries such as India, Lebanon and China, Wigwe said.\n\nThe African trade pact aims to bolster intra-regional commerce by lowering or eliminating cross-border tariffs, facilitating the movement of capital and people, promoting investment and paving the way for the establishment of a continental-wide customs union.\n\nAccess Bank plans to eventually expand into 22 African countries to cushion challenges in some markets, diversify earnings and take advantage of growth opportunities in the region.\n\nThe lender, which is looking to transition to a holding company this year, plans to open subsidiaries in insurance brokerage, consumer lending and agency banking as well as payments to boost revenue, Wigwe added.\n\nThe bank is equally transforming payments and remittances using cheap forex from international remittances to feed trade, leveraging AccessAfrica connections to wallets and payment platforms.\n\nIt is also building on partnerships with financial investors, Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), among others and providing strategic support to protect and grow partners\u2019 value.\n\nContinuing, he said the bank has continued to deliver strong results and is focused on generating sustainable revenue across all income lines.\n\nExpansions across Africa thicken\n\nAccess Bank has also unfolded plans to expand to more African countries as part of a strategy to support trade and finance in the continent and take advantage of the AfCFTA.\n\nFor instance, Access Bank Plc recently entered into a definitive and binding agreement with ABC Holdings Limited to acquire 78.15 per cent shareholding in the African Banking Corporation of Botswana Limited (BancABC Botswana).\n\nThe transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and customary conditions precedent, is expected to close before the end of this quarter. The ABC Holdings is a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange listed group \u2013 Atlas Mara Limited.\n\nAccess Bank Company Secretary, Sunday Ekwochi, described Bostwana as renowned for its quality sovereign credit rating and stability with the bank\u2019s market entry expected to further solidify its strategy as, \u201ca strong banking partner in key verticals across retail and corporate banking, including especially supporting trade in payments across southern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa more broadly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the deal, Wigwe, said: \u201cWe remain committed to a disciplined and thoughtful expansion strategy in Africa, which we believe will create strong, sustainable returns for our shareholders and stakeholders at large, over the medium and long-term.\n\n\u201cThe establishment of Access Bank through this acquisition in the Republic of Botswana will position the bank to deliver a more complete set of banking solutions to its clients active in and across the SADC and COMESA regions.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the transaction complements the bank\u2019s recent strategic growth acquisitions in South Africa, Zambia and Mozambique. \u201cWe are building a bank of the future that Africans across Africa and the world would be proud of and look forward to welcoming the employees, customers and other stakeholders of BancABC Botswana to Access Bank,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBancABC Botswana is the fifth largest bank in Botswana and is a very well-capitalised banking institution poised for growth and success in its local market. The bank has been perennially profitable, given an existing high-quality retail loan book with opportunities and scope for diversification and further expansion into corporate and small medium enterprises (SME) lending.\n\nContinuing, Wigwe explained that across Africa, there is an opportunity for the bank to expand to high-potential markets, leveraging the benefits of AfCFTA. He said AfCFTA, among other benefits, would expand intra-Africa trade and provide real opportunities for the continent.\n\nHe stated that the plan is for the bank to establish its presence in 22 African countries so as to diversify its earnings and take advantage of growth opportunities in Africa.\n\nGuaranteed commitment to shareholders\n\nAccess Bank Plc has consistently assured its shareholders of improved performance and returns as it continues to implement its pan-African expansion programme.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Lagos, which was also streamed real time online, directors of the bank assured that it has been well-positioned for sustained growth and better returns, and shareholders will continue to see higher dividends in the years ahead.\n\nThe assurance came as shareholders approved payment of a final dividend of 55 kobo, in addition to an interim dividend of 25 kobo, bringing total dividend per share for the 2020 business year to 80 kobo. In the audited report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2020, Access Bank had grown net profit by 13 per cent to N106 billion in 2020 as against N94 billion recorded in 2019.\n\nThe assurance also came on the heels of the release of the first quarter (Q1) results of the bank for the period ended March 31, 2021, showing considerable growths across all key performance indicators.\n\nChairman, Ibadan Zone Shareholders Association (IBZA), Mr. Eric Akinduro commended the bank for riding through the COVID-19 pandemic and delivering improved results that led to the declaration of 80 kobo dividend.\n\nHe said the various acquisitions by Access Bank across Africa showed that the institution is strong, assuring the bank of shareholders\u2019 supports.\n\nFounder, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Sir Sunny Nwosu, said Access Bank\u2019s expansion drive shows that the bank is really committed to its aim of playing a leading role in the African continent.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the expansion drive would lead to better returns to shareholders and other stakeholders in the years ahead.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nThe Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), Fr. Ejike Mbaka. has said he was not arrested or detained by security agents.\n\nThe cleric, who arrived to a rousing welcome at the Adoration Ground around 7:15pm told faithful he was invited to a meeting with the Bishop of Enugu Catholic Diocese, Callistus Onaga, where he was ordered to vacate the adoration ground and remain silent for 30 days.\n\nHe said he was surprised to see other persons at the meeting which he thought was only between him and the Bishop.\n\nHe said there was a plan to shut the adoration ground over his recent comments against the government.\n\n\u201cThey ordered me to leave the Adoration Ground for 30 days; to be silent for 30 days and to leave Enugu. Their plan was to even send me to Rome after the 30 days.\n\n\u201cI asked them why I was being punished. They cannot not tell me who to bless. They are angry that I blessed Nnamdi Kanu. I am a priest of God and nobody can tell me who to bless. Is it your blessing? Are you the one giving him life? Are you the one giving him life? Go and take away God\u2019s blessings from him.\n\n\u201cIf you said I spoke against government is there no insecurity in the country? Are they angry that I said government should provide jobs for the youths? I am a priest of God and I will continue to bless and speak the truth.\n\n\u201cI saw the implication of keeping me there. I told them that my people will look for me if they don\u2019t allow me to attend today\u2019s programme (E no dey again).\n\n\u201cWhat would have happened if I had has left Enugu as they instructed? We are a people of peace so I want you all to be peaceful. We wilI meet here again on Sunday God willing.\u201d\n\nPandemonium had broken out, yesterday, as thousands of adherents took to the streets seeking the whereabouts of the fiery priest.\n\nHis followers had stormed the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Bishop Callistus Onaga, demanding his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to the protesters, Bishop had invited Mbaka for a meeting by 10am on Tuesday and they had neither seen nor heard from him since then.\n\nThe cleric, however, showed up at about 2:50pm as tension was reaching a breaking point on his whereabouts with many alleging that government was complicit in his \u2018disappearance\u2019.\n\nHe emerged at the junction of Igboeze Street where he alighted from an SUV and urged protesters to return to Adoration Ground in Umuchigbo for him to address them. It was learnt that the priest may have emerged from the Government House axis of Enugu.\n\nEyewitnesses said having received no positive response and fearing that the bishop may have handed the priest to security agents, the protesters had descended on Bishop\u2019s Court, residence of Bishop Onaga, and vandalised property, especially glasses, doors, the Bishop\u2019s office before marching to destroy a bookshop, guest house, two buildings, four big water tanks and other facilities at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Some workers there sustained various degrees of injury.\n\nThere was heavy presence of joint security forces of the army, police, National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services both at the Bishop\u2019s Court and the Holy Ghost Cathedral.\n\nDSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, had denied that Mbaka was in their custody.\n\nFears of his possible arrest arose as Mbaka last week Wednesday called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over worsening security challenges in the country.\n\nLast Sunday, the DSS issued a warning to individuals and groups to be mindful of utterances and actions that threatened the country\u2019s peace and sovereignty.",

          "text": "\u2022Threatens to \u2018ruffle unruly feathers\u2019\n\n\u2022Accusation baseless, PDP, Afenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN fire back\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe presidency yesterday accused some religious and political leaders of plotting to forcibly remove President Muhammadu Buhari from office, warning that it would thwart the moves and ruffle some unruly feathers in the process.\n\nThe presidency, however, came under fire as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere; the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in separate reactions dismissed the allegation.\n\nThe main opposition party described the allegation as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nAfenifere said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said in a statement that available evidence indicated that some disgruntled religious and past political leaders are poised to throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel an undemocratic change of leadership.\n\nAdesina\u2019s statement came a day after the Department of State Services (DSS) alleged that some \u201cmisguided elements\u201d were threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nDSS spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Monday, had said that among those threatening the federal government and Nigeria\u2019s unity are \u201csome religious and past political leaders who have either called for a forceful change of government or mass action against it.\u201d\n\nThe presidency in a reaction to the DSS yesterday said there is proof that the disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of a conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed on the president, thus throwing the land into turmoil.\n\nIt stated: \u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country. The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nIt added that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999 and the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\u201d\n\nThe presidency also accused external forces of collaborating with some individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such moves.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country. But the presidency, already vested with mandate and authority by Nigerians till 2023, pledges to keep the country together, even if some unruly feathers would be ruffled in the process,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some analysts told THISDAY last night that the presidency might have been reacting to a grand move by some past leaders of the country to hold a conference to discuss the state of the nation, which they said had been hemmed by massive violence from non-state actors, including bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and separatist elements.\n\nThe conference being facilitated by a former head of state is expected to be attended by leaders of prominent regional political groups, civil society organisations, religious leaders and past political office holders.\n\nThe groundwork had reached an advanced stage and state intelligence agencies and the presidency, the analysts, said may have panicked in the fear that the conference in dissecting the litany of woes that have befallen the country may throw up conversations and conclusions that are certain to embarrass the Buhari administration.\n\nThis is Blackmail, PDP Fires Back\n\nReacting to the allegation, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed it, describing it as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe PDP said rather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing the nation, the presidency was engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that the Buhari presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically-elected government.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cThe presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically-elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood.\n\n\u201cEven in 2019, Nigerians will be quick to remember how the APC imported bandits, vandals and thugs from neighbouring countries, as political mercenaries, to unleash violence, disrupt our voting processes and muscle itself into power.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the presidency and the APC to look inwards for those allegedly plotting to upturn democracy.\n\n\u201cOur party believes that the statement by the Buhari presidency is an attempt by the APC to heighten political tension in our country ahead of the 2023 election, having realised that they cannot face the people at the polls,\u201d it added.\n\nThe PDP, however, advised the APC to know that such blackmail against Nigerians cannot work.\n\n\u201cFor us in the PDP, our party will remain undeterred, alongside other patriotic Nigerians, in our commitment towards the sustenance and stability of our democracy as well as the unity and corporate existence of our country, Nigeria,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN Dismiss allegation\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF and the CAN also dismissed the allegation by the presidency that some religious and political leaders are part of a plot to overthrow Buhari.\n\nThe leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the whole world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that given Buhari\u2019s poor performance, there is no need for any group to \u201cgather anywhere to pass a vote of no confidence in him.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo, who described the 1999 Constitution as a fraud, also urged the president to, as a matter of urgency, return the 1964 Constitution agreed on by the founding fathers of Nigeria, including the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho is interested in passing vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him? That is not the issue. The main thing is to restructure the country back to federalism and forget all these gossips by Adesina. We don\u2019t have to pass a vote of no confidence for the world to know we don\u2019t have any confidence in Buhari.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any group who wants to take over the government, but I know those of us who want the country to be restructured in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cThose of us in Afenifere and all other groups in the South who are agitating for restructuring are the friends of Nigeria, are the friends of Buhari. I hope it is not too late for Buhari to realise this.\u201d\n\nACF also said it was wrong for the presidency to see all its critics as disgruntled people with ulterior motives.\n\nThe spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, told THISDAY that the presidency should be broad-minded and tolerate all shades of opinions.\n\nAccording to him, many criticisms against the government are done in good faith to help improve the situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany criticisms are done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the president and his team were becoming confused.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president and his team have gone blind and confused since in their world view, Rev. Father Mbaka and others who are telling them the truth about what is happening in the country have now become enemies.\n\n\u201cYou should know they have run out of excuses and have turned to blackmail even those who love them and want them to do what is good for the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEvery religious leader who chooses to stand with the people and is demanding good governance is now disgruntled.\u201d\n\nThe CAN chairman said the presidency needed \u201cto pause a little and remember that these people whom they are calling names today stood with them and for them when those who think they know them more warned against it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians have since passed their vote on Buhari and his government after watching helplessly how bandits have taken over the country; our young university students are being killed and destroyed.\u201d\n\nHayab appealed to those who are making statements on behalf of the presidency to be careful with their poor words and strive to win the support and confidence of the people with love and facts, not blackmail.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the CAN President on Media and Communications, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said beyond praying for things to get better, religious leaders reserved the right to criticise the authorities if they were not doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf the government accused some religious and past political leaders of planning to remove President Muhammadu Buhari, in what ways has that concerned the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)? The biblical responsibilities of the church include but not limited to praying for those who are in the position of authority but to criticise when doing wrongs or performing below the average. Check the Bible; there was never a time a bad ruler was spared from criticism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the government should pre-occupy itself with how best to tackle insecurity and ensure the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cOur candid advice to the government is to find an answer to the menace of insecurity occasioned by the bandits, kidnappers and terrorists. The country is approaching the precipice and President Muhammadu Buhari is in the position of rescuing the country by stopping the unprecedented bloodshed.\n\n\u201cIt is only the fool that goes to bed when his roof is on fire. Our members and non-members are being kidnapped and killed while the government appears helpless,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, fixing the security challenges is beyond issuing press releases or threatening to deal with the criminals.\n\nHe stated that 24 hours after Buhari vowed never to tolerate any banditry attack on schools, the bandits struck, adding that the victims are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cWhat is the government doing to rescue the victims? Some university students who were kidnapped in Kaduna are being killed but the government is too busy threatening the critics. We advise the presidency to recall all the promises made by Buhari during the electioneering and what is happening under his watch. Until his government wakes up to its responsibilities, the church will not keep quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a reaction, PANDEF National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, expressed shock that the presidency would under the prevailing situation of disastrous insecurity tag religious leaders and past political leaders \u201cdisgruntled.\u201d\n\nHe said such a statement was the least expected from government.\n\nThe group urged the presidency to stop chasing shadows, stressing that Nigerians are anxious, troubled and many are becoming hopeless over the worsening insecurity, while the security agencies appear helpless and vulnerable.\n\nPANDEF asked Buhari to involve all critical stakeholders nationwide in efforts at finding solutions to the problems facing the nation.\n\nIt said: \u201cWhat we expect from President Muhammadu Buhari, at this time, is to rally all critical stakeholders, from all sectors and sections of the country, to build national consensus and fashion out collective and holistic ways to address the hybrid problems confronting the country. This is not the time for arbitrary statements.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abductors free one more captive\n\n\u2022Security council meeting continues today\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed its commitment to do all it could to save the remaining 16 students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, whose abductors have threatened to kill for the delay in ransoming them.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja where he faulted the recommendations by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in resolving the growing insecurity in the country, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the federal government, in line with its constitutional responsibility of protecting all Nigerians, would not fold its arms and allow the bandits who kidnapped the students execute them.\n\nThe bandits had on Monday threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom was not met by yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by yesterday, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nOf the about 22 students abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm, the bandits have killed five.\n\nHowever, the bandits might have reconsidered their decision to kill the remaining students yesterday as one of them was freed under a yet-to-be-clear circumstances. Their parents also appealed to the bandits to spare the lives of the students.\n\nAt the press conference in Abuja, Mohammad also spoke on efforts by the federal government to combat the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHowever, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the three service chiefs will tomorrow brief the Senate on their efforts so far to address the security problems.\n\nMohammed also faulted the recommendations by the PDP in resolving the security crisis, saying the contents of its recent press conference had exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of Monday\u2019s press briefing by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in which he canvassed, among others, state police, devolution of powers and the establishment of border protection council, as part of steps to combat insecurity.\n\nMohammed accused PDP of merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\nThe minister also threatened to expose the forces behind the current security challenges at the \u2018\u2019appropriate time\u2019\u2019 and deal with them.\n\nHe stated that the alarm raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) on the plot by some powerful forces to destabilise the government only confirmed the consistent position of the federal government that there were plots by some political forces to make the country ungovernable.\n\nHe said the federal government was shocked that \u2018\u2019a party that ruled the country for all of 16 years does not know that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offences.\u201d\n\nIt advised the PDP to call out the states, including those being controlled by it, to ensure a rigorous prosecution of arrested kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u2018\u2019PDP conveniently forgot that as far as terrorism, a federal offence, is concerned, this federal government has successfully prosecuted thousands of Boko Haram members in Kainji, as part of a continuing exercise. We are now seeking the cooperation of the judiciary to continue with the trial of arrested terrorists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister explained that while PDP claimed to have ostensibly offered suggestions to the federal government on some topical issues, especially national security by dropping the toga of politics in the national interest, the party played cheap politics.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019The party went ahead to make wild accusations against the president and his government. For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a government of exclusion.\n\n\u2018\u2019The opposition party then went ahead to reel out a number of suggestions as a way out of the current challenges facing the nation. Unfortunately, the recommendations by the PDP have exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry, and the fact that it was merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\n\u2018\u2019Had it not been so, and had it done its homework properly, the PDP would have known that most of those same recommendations were already contained in the outcome of the federal government\u2019s town hall meeting on national security, which was held in Kaduna on April 8, 2021,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\n\nAbductors Free One More Kaduna Student\n\nMeanwhile, one of the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, has been released.\n\nThe mother of the released student, Mrs. Lauretta Attahiru, confirmed this yesterday to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nShe, however, declined to make further comments on how her son was released.\n\nThe police could not also be reached to confirm the release of the student as Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police command, did not respond to telephone calls and a text message.\n\nThe parents had earlier said the bandits had been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20 million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students remained uncertain yesterday, especially given the bandits\u2019 threat to kill them over the inability to ransom them.\n\nAlso yesterday, the President of the National Association of Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTA), Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, pleaded with the bandits to spare the lives of their victims.\n\nDanjuma told journalists in Kaduna that the parents of the affected students and Nigerians had been gripped by fear and tension following the threat by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cWe are simply begging them not to kill any other student in view of the fact that they are innocent.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is really worrisome and we as parents, are concerned and worried over the lives of our students and teachers of the university,\u201d he said.\n\nA former senator who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, also appealed to Fulani socio-cultural groups to intercede to secure the release of the students.\n\nSani tweeted that he had privately appealed to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore to help secure the release of the students.\n\nSecurity Council Meeting Continues Today\n\nMeanwhile, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja, to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting, which will be the third in less than a week, will as usual be presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIndications that the meeting will continue today was emerged when yesterday\u2019s meeting ended without any media briefing or press statement issued.\n\nAlso, the President of the Senate, Dr .Ahmad Lawan, at Senate plenary on why the CDS and the service chiefs could not appear before the senators yesterday, said at the commencement of plenary that the military top brass could not honour invitation due to the National Security Council meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, the National Security Council is continuing its meeting that it started last week. Therefore the invited security heads will not be able to come for the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure if they will finish their meeting today (Tuesday). We assume it could spill to Wednesday too,\u201d he added.\n\nLawan, however, said the CDS and the service chiefs would brief the Senate tomorrow on the security situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have now fixed the date for the briefing to be Thursday, May 6,\u201d adding that the briefing will enrich the knowledge of his colleagues about security issues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Mergers of MDAs, budget review on the card\n\n\u2022Akabueze proposes six-region structure\n\nNdubuisi Francis, Olawale Ajimotokan and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has initiated a raft of measures to cut the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue occasioned by the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant global economic tailspin.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said yesterday in Abuja that the measures were targeted at reducing recurrent expenditure, which is projected to gulp about 41.5 per cent of the total provisions of N13.588 trillion in the 2021 budget, amounting to N5.64 trillion.\n\nShe stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the salaries and wages committee to review the payroll of public servants as well as consider the merger of some agencies.\n\nBesides, the government will also remove some unnecessary items from the budget as a move to cut the cost of governance.\n\nAhmed spoke at a policy dialogue on \u2018corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practice and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nAlso at the occasion, the Director-General, Budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, proposed a constitutional amendment to pave the way for the restructuring of the country into six regions instead of the present 36 states structure. This, he said, would help to reduce the rising cost of governance.\n\nAhmed stated that the proposed cost-saving measures was aimed at streamlining government expenditure with revenue.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue.\u201d\n\nShe urged all government agencies to come together to trim the cost amid the country\u2019s dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the nation\u2019s budgets are filled every year with projects that are recycled and that are also not necessary.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair, work together with the head of service and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister said the federal government would also review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates, adding that the government will consider merging two agencies with the same mandate.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe need to work together; all agencies of the government to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures\u2013expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year-in-year out with projects that we see over and over again and also projects that are not necessary.\u201d\n\nAkabueze, in a paper titled: \u2018Reducing the Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 described the country\u2019s current system of democratic governance as very expansive and expensive.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that mandated the president to appoint a minister from at least each of the 36 states, should be amended to reduce the number of federal cabinet members.\n\nHe cited the large federal structure to be one of the drivers of the high cost of governance and engendering public outcry that government spending is largely on recurrent activities at the expense of capital projects.\n\nWhile describing the subsisting fiscal policy as unsustainable, Akabueze said the persistent call for the reduction of governance cost had continued to gain momentum in view of its impact on government fiscal situation.\n\nHe stated that the cost of governance is considerably cheaper in the United States from where Nigeria copied the presidential system of government.\n\nAccording to him, the general cost of administration in the United States is less than 10 per cent of the total annual budgets while the United States, with a higher population than Nigeria, has only 15 secretaries and executive departments as against Nigeria, which has 27 ministers, 16 ministers of state and 27 ministries.\n\nHe lamented that the federal government is maintaining 943 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) with many of them having duplicated functions.\n\n\u201cThere are 541 federal government-owned public corporations and enterprises. We need to cut these in order to install efficiency in governance. Also, we have a bloated civil service. The current civil service structure and size is clearly unsustainable for Nigeria\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warned against the tendency where the civil service is accorded political, ethnic and religious patronage.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive staff auditing and job available is imperative to determine the right size of the federal civil service without having any adverse effect on the service. And to avoid duplication in the civil service, the staff rationalisation programme should be gradual,\u201d he added.\n\nAkabueze said the federal government\u2019s recurrent spending accounted for more than 75 per cent of the actual MDAs expenditure between 2011 and 2020, in addition to personnel cost which accounted for government significant spending.\n\nHe accused the MDAs of incurring excessive personnel costs and wilfully indulging in wide range of underhand practices that are driving governance cost out of the ordinary.\n\nAccording to him, in 2016, personnel cost was N1.87 trillion while at the moment the same cost has spiralled to over N3 trillion.\n\nThe effect of the rising cost of running government, Akabueze added, is the reason why only 30 per cent of the budget is available for capital project and the cause behind many abandoned capital projects nationwide.\n\nHe said: \u201cPersonnel cost accounted for 31 per cent and 63 per cent of the total spending and retained revenue in 2020. In the USA, the general administration cost is less than 10 per cent of total budget.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe challenged Nigerians to task themselves on governance, saying that the success story of the Asian Tiger was a product of sound leadership and determination.\n\nICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, described the cost of governance as the driver of corruption in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government was committed to improving the country\u2019s revenue by focusing on new and existing sources and by streamlining payroll.\n\nHe added that the federal government would also ensure removal of subsidies and reduction in the cost of contracts and procurement are for the benefits of the vulnerable.\n\nHe listed critical area of concern to include payroll padding and the phenomenon of ghost workers.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s intended cost-cutting approach is coming amid a report by a public finance transparency advocacy firm, BudgIT that the 2021 federal budget contains over 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion.\n\nBudgIT, a public finance transparency advocacy firm, said in a report that the duplication of projects was just one among other loopholes for corruption in the budget.\n\nIt added that there were no audit records of N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\n\nIt said: \u201cOur investigations into the 2021 budget revealed at least 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion, with 115 of those duplicate projects occurring in the Ministry of Health. This is very disturbing, especially considering the health infrastructure deficit and the raging COVID-19 pandemic affecting Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBudgIT also found zero audit records of the N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\u201d\n\nIt also alleged that budgetary provisions were made for agencies for projects that are beyond their execution. It added: \u201cEven worse, agencies now receive allocations for capital projects they cannot execute. For example, the National Agriculture Seed Council has an allocation for N400m to construct solar street lights across all six geopolitical zones, while the Federal College of Forestry in Ibadan in Oyo State got N50m for the construction of street lights in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThese are aberrations that need to be corrected.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Falana and Falana Chambers, the office of a renowned human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) has demanded the immediate release of one Mr Abiodun Emmanuel Ilesanmi illegally detained by operatives of State Security Services (also called Department of State Services).\n\nAccording to the lawyer, the secret police operatives invaded the residence of Ilesanmi at Alapere/Ogudu Estate in Lagos at midnight of April 2, 2021.\n\nFemi Falana (SAN)\n\nThe victim is a rice trader at the popular Mile 12 Commodity Market of Ketu, Lagos, who was now known to have committed any known offence.\n\nHis residence and shop were also said to be 'clean' after they were searched by the SSS officers.\n\nThis was contained in a letter by Falana & Falana Chambers, dated May 5, 2021 and addressed to the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission situated at 19, Aguiyi Ironsi Street, Maitama, Abuja.\n\nIn the letter written on Wednesday and made available to SaharaReporters, the Chambers claimed that the SSS requested for a Senator or Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to stand as a surety before Ilesanmi could be released.\n\n\u201cAt about 2am on 2nd April, 2021, a team of armed officers of the State Security Service, Shagisha, Lagos State, broke into our client\u2019s house at Alapere/Ogudu Estate Lagos, searched the entire house, and carted away money, documents and other valuable items.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the illegal search, the SSS officials arrested our client without a warrant of arrest and took him away. A few hours later, our client was later taken to his shop at Mile 12 Commodity Market by the armed officers of the SSS which was searched without a search warrant. Even though nothing incriminating was found, the officers took away 2 bags of rice.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding that our client has not committed any criminal offence known to the law, he has remained in the custody of the SSS since 2nd of April, 2021 without a remand order. In response to our application of the release of our client, the SSS demanded that we produce a surety who must be a Senator or a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cApart from the fact that our client has not committed any offence to warrant the production of a surety, he is not in a position to find a Senator or Minister to stand as surety for him.\n\n\u201cAssuming without conceding that our client committed an \u2018offence\u2019 for being in possession of 2 bags of rice, it has nothing to do with the security of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. To that extent, the case file ought to have been transferred to the Nigeria Customs Service or the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for investigation and possible prosecution if it established that our client committed any offence.\n\n\u201cHaving regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, you will agree with us that our client\u2019s fundamental rights to personal liberty and dignity of the human person as guaranteed by sections 34 and 35 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Articles 5 and 6 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (Enforcement and Ratification) Act have been violated by the SSS without any legal justification whatsoever.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore compelled to request you to use your good offices to prevail on the management of the SSS to release our client from illegal custody forthwith.\n\n\u201cAccept our assurances of the highest professional esteem while we await your positive response to our request,\u201d the letter said.",

We call ourselves the giant of Africa and yet we are the least represented both at the national and state levels of assemblies.\n\n\u201cHaving this bill passed will make a big difference in the development of our country, because we can see the development going fast in countries where we have more women participation at the helm of leadership and Nigeria should not be an exception.\u201d",

          "text": "Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu started Carry1st in 2018 to publish mobile games and interactive content for Africans. One of their games, Carry1st Trivia, got a lot of buzz in 2020 with about one and a half million downloads.\n\nIn the three years since its launch, Carry1st has also become a medium for bringing mobile gaming from global companies to Africa. The Cape Town-based company realised that developers have had problems with distribution and payments in Africa.\n\nThey decided to solve that by embedding a fintech solution, Pay1st, on their platform. Pay1st features popular payment methods from six African countries, giving African gamers on Carry1st the ability to pay how they want.\n\nThe result is a company that is a publishing platform for games but also a full-stack management solution for game developers seeking user acquisition, marketing and monetization in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we were able to successfully sign 7 great titles, recruit a top-notch international team, and build out our payments and digital commerce platform,\u201d Robbin-Coker, CEO of Carry1st, said in a statement.\n\nRight to Left: Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu, Carry1st co-founders. Image source: Carry1st.\n\nNow the startup is positioned to take advantage of the stability and opportunity they have found. They have announced the close of a $6 million Series A round led by Konvoy Ventures, an early-stage VC firm based in the US State of Colorado. Carry1st joins a list of other gaming companies on Konvoy\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJackson Vaughan, Managing Partner at Konvoy Ventures, joins Carry1st\u2019s board as a result of the investment. He said Carry1st\u2019s advantage is in \u201capproaching sub-regions with contextual understanding.\u201d\n\nOther investors in the round include Riot Games (the company behind \u2018League of Legends\u2019), Raine Ventures, AET Fund / Akatsuki and TTV Capital.\n\nWith this round, Carry1st has now raised $9.5m since it was founded. The most recent funding round before this was in May 2020 when they raised $2.5million from a seed round led by CRE Venture Capital.\n\nCarry1st plans to enter new partnerships with global gaming studios.

          "text": "Lami, a Kenyan insurtech company democratizing insurance products and services for low-income Kenyans, has raised $1.8 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Accion Venture Lab.\n\nFounded by Jihan Abass in 2018, Lami is a digital insurance platform that enables partner businesses \u2013 including banks, tech companies, and other entities to easily and seamlessly offer digital insurance products to their users via its API.\n\nLami can also be used by partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs. Through its API, users can get a quotation for motor, medical, or other tailored insurance products in seconds, then customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit their needs. They get their policy documents instantly and claims are paid in record time.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal Abass said, \u201cSimilar to a payment API/gateway, we process insurance KYC, pricing of products, underwriting of products and claims processing in real time. Let me give you an example, Jumia wanted to launch an insurance marketplace but they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of integrating with every single insurance company and they didn\u2019t want to manage the process of issuing policies. Using our API because we have 20 insurance companies on our platform, they were able to launch this marketplace with a large number of products.\u201d\n\nJulian Abbas Founder & CEO\n\nThe Insurance space in Africa\n\nWith a 3% penetration rate (except for South Africa), Africa\u2019s insurance market is lagging behind. In Kenya where Lami is based less than 20% of the population has access to health insurance.\n\nThe major cause of the low adoption is that most insurance providers on the continent fail to offer flexible, affordable and tailored insurance coverage that can provide a safety net for the African consumer. For example, under most health policies customers face restrictions on what facilities and treatments are covered, they struggle to understand coverage terms and face complicated and lengthy claims processes. This results in a longer processing cycle, poor customer satisfaction, and higher distribution costs.\n\nLami\u2019s services are enabled by its flexible insurance rating engine and direct integration with several parties and insurance companies. Lami co-designs innovative products with its underwriting partners to enable businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base, with flexible options that meet their needs and cash flows, such as monthly medical policies for startup employees.\n\nLami\u2019s CEO Jihan Abass said, \u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more people, improving our technology, and growing our presence across Africa as we can continue to address the persistent insurance gap. At Lami, our vision is to help improve the financial resilience of millions by making insurance products more accessible and affordable for underserved populations. By enabling our business partners to offer customized insurance solutions, we are helping them provide more value to their customers, while enabling large volumes of users to access insurance, often for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe Lami team at work\n\nSince its inception, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies and has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer, and Madison Insurance, distributing more than 30 products available including medical, motor, employee benefits, and device insurance. As an innovator in the digital insurance space, Lami aims to continue diversifying its business by looking for new partners and building on its core technology.\n\nMichael Schlein, President and CEO, Accion Venture Lab, said, \u201cNinety-seven percent of Africans lack access to insurance \u2013 a financial safety net that can help them build resilience against economic shocks. Lami helps address this need for consumers across Africa through its innovative approach that leverages technology and partnerships to help any business develop and sell insurance.\u201d\n\nWithin the past month Malian insurtech OKO and Nigerian insurtech Curacel raised a combined amount of $1.6 million, Lami\u2019s funding news is a reminder that there\u2019s some activity in the African insurtech space. Also, with less than 5% of venture capital going to female-led startups in 2019, it\u2019s positive news to see another female-led company being funded.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fourth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

Prior to the Fair, the ventures will conduct strategy with the MBA cohort at Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. For the two days, the companies will receive networking opportunities, masterclasses, and mentorship. The Fair will culminate in a pitch competition where cash prizes will be awarded to the winners.\n\nThis pitch competition will be live streamed for conference attendees on Saturday, May 29, from 2 to 5 pm.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

Paxful is one of the biggest crypto P2P trading platforms globally.\n\nData from UsefulTulips, a website that explores the global use cases of cryptocurrencies, reveals that Nigeria transacted $99.1 million worth of Bitcoins in the first quarter of 2021. This figure surpasses Kenya\u2019s Bitcoin P2P transactions for the whole of 2020. Kenya comes in second with a Bitcoin P2P trading value worth $38.4 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGhana and South Africa rank third and fourth, respectively, with Bitcoin P2P transaction values of $27.4 million and $25.8 million\n\nGlobally, Nigeria sits with China, the US, India, and Kenya in Paxful\u2019s P2P rankings.\n\nThis comes as no surprise as Africa\u2019s most populous nation had been making waves on Paxful\u2019s P2P trading platform. Techpoint Africa earlier reported that Nigeria traded more than $566 million worth of bitcoins in the last five years, coming second to the US. In 2020, Paxful had over a million accounts registered from Nigeria.\n\nInteresting, a Techpoint Africa report, states that three crypto exchanges \u2014 Busha, BuyCoins, and Bitsika \u2014 claimed to have processed $219.2 million, $141.39 million, and $39.95 million, respectively. With a total of about $400,556,913 million, it is safe to say that perhaps the transactions are greater as other local exchanges did not disclose their transaction volumes.\n\nSurprisingly, the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN\u2019s) crypto ban in mid-February 2021, did nothing to reduce the volume of crypto activities in the country. If anything, crypto transactions seem to have increased significantly since.\n\nIn a press release dated February 7, 2021, the CBN claimed that cryptocurrencies pose risks of loss of investments and terrorism, among other disadvantages. However, the continuous rise in the use of digital currencies might prove that there is more to gain than lose.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComments",

Therefore, the way we think about university and the purpose of university must also change.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the role of technology in education and the role of technology in transforming lives. We cannot ignore that fact and continue to believe that it is not relevant.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge I am sure you will have to deal with is that of funding the university. Realistically, I don\u2019t think the government alone can fund universities. I think we should explore other means to make our universities viable.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, the University of Benin (UNIBEN) has produced more manpower than any other institution in the state. So, we have an interest and a stake.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it as a federal university; we see it as our own university. We will always do everything we can to support the institution. We have our own universities and we are going through the same challenges you just mentioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI received the result of the visitation panel of Ambrose Alli University, so I can imagine the kind of work you will have to deal with. Your track records speak for itself; if anyone can do the job, it\u2019s you. We have no doubt that you are going to do a thorough job,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nHe charged the panel to come up with recommendations that will help in strengthening the university to be more viable, adding that \u201call our institutions have suffered from a lack of a sense of accountability.

To critics who refer to zanzeespabeautynstyle as mere Instagram business, she responded thus: \u201cZanzeespabeautynstyle deals in bespoke outfits for women of class.\n\nWe have a physical shop, where you can see our bags, slippers, dresses and tops but we deliver worldwide, anywhere DHL can reach. It is not a business that I built overnight. I started in 2014.\u201d\n\nShe also offered an insight into the brand\u2019s exotic name, zanzee: \u201cIt is a coinage from Zainab and Zeenat, names of my daughters.\u201d\n\nTo be successful at your business, she explained further, you must have passion for what you do. \u201cIt was the passion for beauty and lifestyle that made me venture into all the different businesses that I have been doing under the zanzeespabeautynstyle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe teething problems of beauty and style business, such as the frustration of the fluctuating exchange rate, and the unhealthy competition in the sector, can put anyone without passion for the job out of business.\n\nBut, driven by my love and passion for the business, I worked harder and refused to relent. And today, the hard work pays. I have loyal customers across Nigeria and as far away as Dubai, New York and London,\u201d Salami explained further.\n\nTo aspiring entrepreneurs, she counselled further: \u201cBehind the glamour of the beauty business, there is backbreaking work; be determined to put in the hard work without excuses. More importantly, do not give up on your dreams.",

That will cause more problem than good.\n\n\u201cThis is not only happening in Imo, it is happening across the country. So we must be careful before we turn this political.\n\nThat is our position.

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has claimed President Muhammadu Buhari and his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan paid ransoms to kidnappers.\n\nObasanjo made the bombshell statement when he received members of Tiv Professionals Group (TPG) at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Wednesday.\n\nObasanjo said not just the Buhari administration but that of former President Goodluck Jonathan negotiated with kidnappers.\n\n\u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they deny it,\u201d he said.\n\nObasanjo urged the government to develop a means to deal with kidnappers and bandits, instead of pampering them with ransom payment.\n\n\u201cSome people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly.\n\n\u201cHe is a folly. This is because when you pay ransom, you encourage. But if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d he said.\n\nRumours of ransom payment had emerged in several negotiations between the Buhari administration and Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThere were also speculations of ransom payments in negotiations between state governments and terrorists.\n\nThe Buhari government was said to have paid ransom to secure the release of both the Chibok and the Dapchi schoolgirls.\n\nThe Chibok schoolgirls were kidnapped on 14 April 2014 during Jonathan\u2019s era.\n\nBut four years later, Buhari had his own dose of kidnapping, when the Dapchi girls were captured in February 2018 in Yobe state.\n\nLess than a month after, the girls were released, with one of them, Leah Sharibu held back.\n\nRansom was suspected, but the Buhari administration vehemently denied it.\n\nA UN report in August 2018 also disclosed \u2018large ransom payment\u2019 to ISWAP, but Information Minister denied. He said what government paid was a promise of \u2018ceasefire\u2019.\n\nWith more kidnapping targeting students in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states, President Buhari in February publicly denounced ransom.\n\nInstead, he urged states and security agencies to be more proactive in preventing abductions.\n\nHe warned state governors on the dangers of rewarding armed bandits stating that such policies can be disastrous.\n\n\u201cState Governments must review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles. Such a policy has the potential to backfire with disastrous consequences\u201d, Buhari said.\n\n\u201cStates and Local Governments must also play their part by being proactive in improving security in & around schools.\n\n\u201cLet bandits, kidnappers and terrorists not entertain any illusions that they are more powerful than the government.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t mistake our restraint for the humanitarian goals of protecting innocent lives as a weakness or a sign of fear or irresolution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna governor Nasir El-Rufai agreed with the President as he has vowed not to pay a dime to terrorists holding people hostage.\n\nHe has advocated a policy of annihilating the terrorists, saying the only thing they deserve is death.\n\nObasanjo on Wednesday suggested a carrot and stick approach in dealing with insecurity and terrorism, although he did not elaborate.\n\nAccording to reports, Obasanjo was instrumental in the release of the 27 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State.\n\n*With reports by Daily Trust",

          "title": "Catholic Church suspends Father Mbaka amidst Buhari spar; followers on rampage",
          "text": "The Catholic Diocese of Enugu has suspended Ejike Mbaka from church activities for one month, Peoples Gazette can report, as the controversial priest\u2019s political escapades continue to overshadow his theological obligations on a scale that nurtures unending concerns amongst his senior clerics.\n\nMr Mbaka was asked to proceed on suspension with effect from May 3 after being summoned by Callistus Valentine Onaga, the diocesan bishop. Mr Onaga called Mr Mbaka in following his repeated clashes with President Muhammadu Buhari and warned that his conduct was smearing the image of the church, the largest of any Christian organisation worldwide, church officials familiar with the matter told The Gazette.\n\nMost Rev. Dr. Callistus Valentine Onaga\n\nMr Mbaka sparred with Mr Buhari\u2019s aides in a series of verbal fireworks that included the Nigerian presidency threatening to blackmail the priest as a political jobber and public contract racketeer. Mr Mbaka denied the allegations.\n\nStill, Mr Onaga and other senior reverend fathers of the Enugu Diocese were compelled to step in and mitigate the unfolding public perception tumult that could have far-reaching consequences for the conventional but unofficial church and state relationship.\n\nThe church leaders recognised that Mr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry as an independent congregation that does not fall directly under the main church\u2019s control, he could still be reined in as a priest under the Roman Catholic\u2019s certification, officials said.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Mr Mbaka returned to his ministry that lies north of the outskirts of Enugu city centre, where he subsequently incited his members against the bishop, sources said.\n\nMr Mbaka\u2019s followers claimed without evidence that he was kidnapped by Mr Onaga and handed over to the State Security Service. They subsequently marched on the premises of the bishop on Wednesday morning, looting and destroying assets therein.\n\nThe mob also descended on the Holy Ghost Cathedral, again looting and destroying items in the building. The members also went to town to allege that the SSS had arrested Mr Mbaka \u2014 generating widespread media reports despite lacking requisite corroboration. The Gazette did not publish the claim.\n\nA spokesman for the SSS denied taking Mr Mbaka into custody or coming in any contacts with him when reached by The Gazette, contrary to his followers\u2019 rumours.\n\nA spokesman for the diocese did not immediately return a request seeking comments. Mr Mbaka\u2019s line was switched off when dialled by The Gazette on Wednesday night.\n\nBefore falling out with Mr Buhari recently, Mr Mbaka was an ardent supporter of the president. He endorsed his campaign in 2015 and claimed his blessings played a role in its success.\n\nBut as Mr Buhari\u2019s regime failed to tackle acute poverty and insecurity, Mr Mbaka said he was compelled to speak up and distance himself from his regime, describing it as evil and satanic and calling on the president himself to vacate office.\n\nBuhari and Mbaka\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s controversial spokesman Garba Shehu subsequently issued a statement, claiming Mr Mbaka\u2019s comments were out of anger for his unsuccessful attempts to corner lucrative federal contracts. The priest denied the allegations but confirmed that he recommended a group of security contractors to the president whose proposals were not acted upon.\n\nChurch sources said Mr Mbaka\u2019s latest suspension was being viewed as significant for its undertone, but not the first time the fiery priest would face administrative action.\n\n\u201cWe know people will link this to his confrontation with Buhari, but he was once demoted from a parish priest to a deputy under a parish priest,\u201d a church official said. \u201cHe had also been transferred from bigger parishes to smaller ones for his frequent infractions in the past.\u201d\n\nStill, church officials admitted Mr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry has been a cash cow for the Enugu Diocese, even though it was built by Mr Mbaka and not directly under its control.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is the Diocese has been financially dependent on Mbaka, collecting his millions,\u201d a source said, adding that some of the senior clerics themselves have also been in bed with politicians whom Mr Mbaka has long railed against.",

We went to him and when we got to him that day, he actually told us his challenges arising from the fact that the government officials in Kaduna State and some Nigerians are accusing him of having a connection with the bandits which has become one of the hindrances he has as to how to end the banditry.\n\n\u201cHe felt that the people that are ravaging the whole place need to be reached to with a message of Islam and he established contact with them and gave them an appointment, went to the bush with them and preached to them and then make them to understand that what they are doing is wrong which every well-meaning Nigerian should be able to commend him for that but we are not doing.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident (kidnapping) took place in some states outside Kaduna, he was able to reach the bandits, talk with them and mediate between them and the families or the state governments and they were able to sort it out.\n\n\u201cBut people are asking questions; how did he know where they are? Even you (interviewer) as you are, if you have an interest in knowing where the bandits are, you will get to know the place. Remember he made a statement that the government is asking how he knows where they are and he said even the government knows where they are.\n\n\u201cBecause this clergyman is coming out to tell Nigerians what is happening in the country, some people develop unnecessary hatred for him and that is why we are where we are because we don\u2019t want to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nSanni, however, condemned the Federal and Kaduna State Government for not having the political will to secure the release of their wards.\n\nThe parents\u2019 spokesman added that the government knows the bandits\u2019 whereabouts but lacks the willpower to go after them.\n\nHe asserted that the parents preferred to pay ransom to secure their children\u2019s release and have themselves arrested later on.\n\nSanni said the parents have been emotionally, psychologically, and mentally imprisoned since the kidnap of their children 56 days ago.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has called on the Federal Government to develop means to deal with kidnappers and bandits heavily in place of the payment of ransom.\n\nHe also stressed the need for leaders to ensure the 2023 birth emergence of a new federation in the nation, warning that the country may slide into what he described as ground dissolution.\n\nThe elder statesman made the recommendation on Wednesday when he received members of the Tiv Professionals Group (TPG) led by Professor Zacharys Gundu, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\n\u201cSome people are still reaching out and hoping that lives can still be saved; but a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly. He is a folly.\n\n\u201cThis is because when you pay ransom, you encourage; but if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe added, \u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during (Goodluck) Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they denied it.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who condemned the security challenges in the country, insisted that 2023 must mark a watershed for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe year 2023 should give us the beginning of the emergence of a new federation. Feeling that the rot continues, then we are going to be sliding back to a ground dissolution. God forbid,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting It Right\n\nObasanjo decried that those beating drums of division in the country do not think about the interest of the minority ethnic groups.\n\nHe explained that the minority ethnic groups face oppression and extermination should Nigeria be allowed to break as being agitated by some people.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we will get it right in Nigeria, any leader must look at Nigeria with the prism of the diversity of Nigeria. For as long as you look at Nigeria with the prism of your ethnic group, then you are not going anywhere, either your ethnic group or religious group.\n\n\u201cBut is there hope? There is hope,\u201d the elder statesman stated.\n\nIn his remarks, Professor Gundu told informed his host that people were being maimed in their sleep and on their ancestral land, stressing the need for influential Nigerians to rise to the occasion to stem the tide of killings in the land.\n\n\u201cNigeria seems to be losing the battle against insecurity,\u201d he said while demanding full compensation for victims of killings and destruction in Tiv land.\n\nThe leader of the delegation also sought the proscription of armed Fulani groups and intensified advocacy against nomadic pastoralism.\n\n\u201cThere are different shades of instability in the country. Nigeria is truly bleeding to death. There\u2019s even a population fault line that could lead to the \u2018Lebanon Trap\u2019.\n\n\u201cAll patriots must stand together; but if others have to be enslaved before the country can survive, we will prefer, as Tiv people, to take our destiny in our hands,\u201d he said.",

To get that goal late on, you can see by the celebrations, it was a massive goal and gave us breathing space.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t won nothing yet.

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has opposed moves by the Federal Government to cut salaries of civil servants as well as the number of federal agencies.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had said the FG was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting the salaries of civil servants as well as the number of federal agencies.\n\nThe Minister gave the indication at a \u2018National Policy Dialogue on Corruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in Abuja.\n\nShe directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) to immediately review the salaries of civil servants as well as the number of federal agencies in the country.\n\nBut in a statement by President of the NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, the Congress stated it was most unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLabour argued that multiple devaluation of the naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria have knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across board.\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is \u201cwhich salary is government planning to slash?\u201d It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30000 which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice!\n\n\u201cThe proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous State Governors are still dragging their feet to pay!\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the multiple devaluation of the Naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria has knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across board.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth. Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Labour, the call for salary slash by the Minister is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers.",

The vaccine was previously authorized for anyone 16 or older.\n\nThe announcement comes barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorized for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is also expected to authorize the vaccine for young children by next week, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year.\n\nPfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15 showing there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots.\n\nSharma said the evidence is there that the vaccine is safe and effective in that age group. It is the first vaccine approved for children in Canada.\n\nSharma said about one-fifth of all cases in Canada have occurred in children and teenagers, and having a vaccine for them is a critical part of Canada\u2019s plan.\n\nShe said while most kids don\u2019t experience serious illness from Covid-19, a vaccine also helps protect their friends and family who may be at higher risk of complications.\n\n\u201cIt will also support the return to a more normal life for our children, who have had such a hard time over the past year,\u2033 she said.\n\nKids studied had side effects similar to young adults, the company said, mainly pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s expansion of our authorization represents a significant step forward in helping the Canadian government broaden its vaccination program and begin to help protect adolescents before the start of the next school year,\u201d Fabien Paquette, vaccines lead for Pfizer Canada, said in a statement.\n\nVaccinations have ramped in Canada in months and expects to receive at least 10 million vaccines this month.
