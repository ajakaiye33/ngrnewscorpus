          "title": "Disquiet in NAMA over secret recruitments",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nThere is a massive air of suspense in the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) over the recent shortlisting of about 35 candidates to be trained and recruited as Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) with insiders alleging that majority of the shortlisted candidates were from northern part of the country and almost 18 allegedly from Katsina State.\n\nDaily Sun exclusively learnt that the recruitment process was not only said to be lopsided but also shrouded in secrecy following management\u2019s inability to advertise the vacanciesin line with the law establishing the Federal Character Commission which mandates that vacancies for positions in the Federal Civil Service be advertised in one Southern and one Northern paper for a period of six weeks.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that this was the first time such recruitment of ATCOs in particular was happening in NAMA. The source further said the workers were told that management was able to get approval from the Federal Character Commission because it was allegedly told that what was being done was \u2018not a recruitment but replacement.\u2019\n\nSections 14.3 and 14.4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) requires that there shall be no \u2018predominance of persons from a few states or ethnic or other sectional groups\u2019 in the Federal Government and its agencies. But sources within the agency alleged that it was the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, that sent in the list of the candidates that were shortlisted and accused him of running a \u2018one man show\u2019 by exerting undue control over the six agencies under his supervision.\n\n\u201cAmong those were shortlisted for training as ATCOs, only one or two were from the South East, about three were from the South West, while 18 were from Katsina where the Minister comes from. The remaining recruits were from the rest of the northern states,\u201d a source told Daily Sun.\n\nBarely two years ago, the aviation minister was accused of being responsible for a similar lopsided recruitment into the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) when the agency needed security officers in all airports especially Lagos, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Abuja.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that at the time, FAAN had concluded interviews in all the airports and wanted to give priority to those who were already working as causal staff in the different states because they were used to the terrain.\n\nBut an insider told Daily Sun that after FAAN had concluded the interviews for the candidates, \u201c the minister\u2019s list suddenly emerged from the blues with majority of candidates on the list from the north and about 400 from Katsina alone.\n\nUnfortunately, those interviewed by FAAN who were expecting their employment letters were jettisoned.\n\nAccording to them, although the minister\u2019s candidates didn\u2019t go through any interview, they were given appointment letters and told to camp. After they were redeployed to different states from Katsina, most of them couldn\u2019t cope. How can you carry a level four officer from Katsina to Port Harcourt, how would they cope financially? Most of them returned to Katsina and they are there doing nothing. They just go to their farms and collect salaries at the end of the month because Katisna doesn\u2019t have a busy airport. FAAN had to continue overusing those who were at the airports where we needed people.\u201d\n\nIn his response, AviationMinistry\u2019s Director of Media and Publicity, James Odaudu, categorically denied the allegations leveled against Sirika, telling Daily Sun that the minister is a stickler for due process and was neither responsible for recruitment into agencies nor ensuring that vacancies in NAMA are published in national dailies.\n\nMeanwhile there have been strong concerns over evaluation process in NAMA as the shortlisted candidates in NAMA was conducted on April 12 at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) and the result of the exercise has already been released. Though it is still being kept under wraps, insiders within the agency allege that the evaluation was faulty and didn\u2019t follow the due process that would ensure that very competent people are selected as ATCOs.\n\nOne of the issues raised is that most of those recruited are far above the age of 27 required for the position of a cadet in the Air Traffic Control Department. A source told Daily Sun that in the employment manual, it was stated there that a cadet should not be more than 27 years.\n\n\u201cIf they employ cadets at 25 and they go to Zaria for training for two years, by the time they are through, they will be around 27 or 28 but instead Human Resources employed people that are over 30 years old and by the time they are through with training, they will be about 35 to 37 years. Those who drew up that policy did it because a cadet is supposed to be a trainee. You don\u2019t get someone who by the time he is through with NCAT, will have been 35 to come and train under someone who is 27 years old. This is a critical department that deals with the safety of people\u2019s lives. You don\u2019t bring in elderly people that would not fit to do the job. That is just one of the many criteria of the evaluation process that was not met,\u201d the source said.\n\nDaily Sun also reliably learned from another senior management staff who is not authorised to speak on such matters, that the Nigerian Air Traffic Control Association (NATCA) and the Human Resource department have been at loggerheads over staff welfare and recruitment. The body wrote a letter to the management of the agency, expressing concern over the secretiveness of the entire recruitment process and was very worried that considering the very sensitive job of an ATCO (Air Traffic Controllers are responsible for directing the safe movement of aircraft arriving and departing from airports), the Association needed to be involved in the evaluation to ensure that the candidates meet all necessary requirements and only the best hands are selected.\n\n\u201cThe questions the HR should be asked are what were the criteria for the evaluation? Were proper aero medicals carried out to ensure that they are mentally and physically fit? Who conducted the evaluation? Was a committee which includes experienced ATCOs set up? Why was NATCA not involved in the process as had been the tradition in the past? Because of the safety implications of air travel and the very sensitive duties of ATCOs, the recruitment should have been made open so that more people can apply and the best shortlisted.\n\nTypically, the pass mark for ATCOs in any examination is 75 percent and even if candidate scores 74 percent, the person would be considered to have failed but they just orchestrated the evaluation process in such a way that will make it easy for most of the shortlisted candidates to scale through.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf has said former President Olusegun Obasanjo, controversial Islamic cleric, Sheik Gumi and himself negotiated the release of the 27 abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kagara, Kaduna State.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on Arise TV yesterday, he said the team ensured the release of the students where the Federal Government failed.\n\nYusuf, a professor of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation said no ransom was paid for the release of the students.\n\n\u201cThe first and only negotiations that Sheik Gumi and Obasanjo got involved in, Obasanjo was emphatic that no ransom will be paid and we succeeded in doing that where the government failed. No money exchanged hands in the negotiations, no shot was fired and no life was lost. We did the negotiations and got to get these students released.\n\n\u201cThis is what our rural folks have been passing through for years now, negotiating to get their folks out, selling whatever they have, thanks to the inefficiency of our government. If anyone\u2019s loved one is taken, he will do whatever it takes to get the person out. That is what we have been going through for years, but it is making the news now because it is getting closer to the cities,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nHe also said the bandits want genuine peace because they are tired and that he has learned from several meetings with the bandits that they are willing to listen to religious leaders. He added that banditry is a social issue and should be treated as such. He also added that although there\u2019s a role for the military in the fight against banditry, it won\u2019t make the problem go away.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is what we find out, in all the five states we went in, they listen to clerics. In Niger State, they gathered in force to a meeting of war commanders, from six states, in the forest. There\u2019s a role for the military in all of these. Without the military, the North West would have been overrun by Boko Haram, the North Central will be overrun by these bandits, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) will overrun the South East, there will be warlords all-over South West.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for the military but if anybody tells you there\u2019s a military solution to this conflict, he\u2019s either dishonest or he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. There\u2019s no military solution to this problem. Banditry is a social problem and not a military one. We are increasingly militarising what is essentially a social problem. We are dropping a million-dollar bomb on people we should be providing water for.\u201d",

Lucky Irabor, briefed journalists, yesterday, said president Buhari gave the approval during the security meeting he presided overat the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThey security chiefs were also joined by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who noted that President Buhari presiding over the Security Council three times in two weeks \u201cshows the premium he and his administration has placed on security issues.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have some measures, which we have outlined and have been approvedby the Council and we\u2019ll see how we can change the narrative within the quickest possible means to restore law and order and restore peace in that area.\n\n\u201cWe solicit all law abiding citizens to work with us to identify and deal with the situation. That is that, I may not go into the details of how we will do that.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the meeting stressed the need to address the security challenges in the country, particularly those who had arisen in the last few months.\n\nHe said president gave matching orders to ideal with the emerging problems physically.\n\nThe NSA said: \u201cThe president has given direction on how to make these things effective. Already, the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) has been given certain instructions on how to deal with this, but Council has agreed that the level of insecurity in the country, especially in the last one month, is something that has to be addressed with the immediacy that it requires; and at the operational level, of course, the Chief of Defence Staff has been working with the service chiefs and the recommendations they\u2019ve made to the council are already being handled.\u201d\n\nIrabor, on his part, said: \u201cNo doubt, far-reaching decisions were made. On our part, just as the National Security Adviser indicated, I briefed on various measures that the Armed Forces, in partnership with othersecurity agencies, should take to stem the tide of insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe council was pleased with the actions and, of course, the prayers that were made, which Council has also graciously undertaken to look into. These, of course, have to do with manpower development, training and equipment issues and, thankfully, theglow on my face should, of course, give you an indication as to the graciousness of the National Security Council, in relation to the briefings that we\u2019ve given in this regard, and I believe that going forward, we shall be translating that, and it will have some great impact on the security disposition across the country.\u201d",

I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that.\n\n\u201cThe other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation.

          "text": "A statement issued Wednesday and jointly signed by the SSF Chairman, Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti); Secretary General, Matthew Urhoghide (Edo) and Publicity Secretary, Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu), hailed the Governors for ruminating on the expediency and the need for speedy restructuring of the highly lopsided Nigerian nation, saying this will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\n\nThe SSF leaders stated that ushering of equality , equity and justice in the way the country was being run will wipe out ethnic tension, restore peace and stability and ward off agitations for secession that are now gaining tractions across the land. The Southern Senators also submitted that the deft and unanimous policy of the ban on open cattle grazing would help in reining in those hiding under cattle grazing to unleash terror of kidnapping and killing on the residents of the region. They appaluded the step taken by the Governors, saying it would serve as a buffer to wanton destruction of farmlands, kidnappings and carnages .\n\nThe Senators lamented how the Southern farmers were losing hundreds of millions of Naira to plundering of food crops through encroachments on farmlands and exposing the region to famine and acute food scarcity .\n\nThey said: \u201cAt this critical point of our national life when the economy was being bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens.\n\n\u201cAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\n\u201cMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping , raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\n\u201cWith this uniform resolve by our Governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914\u201d.\n\nThe Southern Senators Forum, therefore, encouraged the Governors to swiftly follow up on their resolutions by immediately approaching the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to working with the two arms of the parliament \u201cto ensure that their well articulated positions on the state of the nation, especially as relate to restructuring, State policing and the jettisoning of archaic traditional grazing methods, which fall short of global best practice standard and a potential threat to national cohesion and peace, are thoroughly and decisively addressed through the ongoing constitutional review exercise\u201d.",

          "text": "\u2022Want appointments to reflect federal character\n\n\u2022Urge Buhari to address nation on insecurity\n\nBy Omon-Julius Onabu\n\nGovernors of the 17 southern states under the aegis of the Southern Governors Forum have called on the federal government to convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency to address widespread agitations among Nigerians for greater inclusiveness in governance.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency,\u201d they said in a communique at the end of their meeting yesterday in Asaba, the Delta State capital.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country and end to open grazing in the Southern parts of the country to curb the excesses of armed herders.\n\nIn the 12-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors stressed the need to review appointments into federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character and the heterogeneity of the Nigerian population.\n\nThey said in the communiqu\u00e9, read by the Chairman of the forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, that they had resolved to foster cooperation among the Southern states and the nation at large.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added that the governors reviewed the situation in the country and deliberated on the current security situation, agitations/restructuring, prospect for inter-state collaboration and partnerships as well as on the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTheir conclusion: \u201cWe affirm that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness, and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nObserving that the incursion of armed herders, criminals, and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security, the governors said open grazing has to stop.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria,\u201d they said, noting that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South.\n\nGiven this scenario, they said, it has become imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South, including cattle movement to the South by foot.\n\nThe governors also recommended that the federal government should support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nThey added that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance the commitment to and practice of true federalism.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is a need to review appointments into the federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogeneous.\u201d\n\nThey expressed concern over the continued gridlock on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway and the chokehold, it exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.\n\nTo ease the gridlock, the governors recommended the activation and establishment of ports in other states of the federation to create new jobs and promote socio-economic activities in the country.\n\nThe governors also expressed concern over the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and suggested greater coordination and cooperation between the federal and state governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\nThey further \u201cexpressed very grave concern on the security challenges currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr. President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people.\n\nBesides Akeredolu, other governors at the meeting were Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State;; Chief Willie Obiano of Anambra State; Senator Duoye Diri of Bayelsa State; Chief Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; Mr. Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; and Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nOthers are: Prince Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State; Mr. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; and Chief Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\nHowever, Prof. Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State were absent, while Mr. Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) and Senator Hope Uzodimma (Imo State) were represented by their deputies.\n\nACF Backs Ban on Open Grazing, Supports Restructuring\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has endorsed the position of the southern governors\u2019 forum on the ban on open grazing of cattle.\n\nSpokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe stated this while reacting to the outcome of the governors\u2019 meeting in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\nHe however said before a decision should be taken on restructuring, Nigerians should first agree on whether the country should remain one before deciding on what structure to adopt.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the ban of open grazing, I don\u2019t think there is much problem here with the stand of the ACF.\n\n\u201cAt our last National Working Committee meeting in Kaduna, the National leader of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria spoke to us at length and he said he and his organisation have decided that the only way forward and that is in the interest of MACBAN, is to embark on ranching and that they were waiting for governments policy on this\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nHe stressed further that, \u201cIf MACABAN wants open grazing banned, not only in the southern part of Nigeria but all over Nigeria, who are we to say otherwise?\n\n\u201cWe are therefore in support of the stand of MACBAN and the Southern state governors.\u201d\n\nHe however said, on the issue of dialogue and restructuring, \u201cthe ACF has always believed in this if the aim of the dialogue is to promote the unity and progress of the whole country.\n\n\u201cOur forum will dialogue with any state and group of people that share our cherished ideals of unity, justice, peace and progress\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nOn restructuring, he said \u201cthe ACF believes that before we make a decision on this, we should agree on whether Nigeria should remain one country before deciding on what structure Nigeria should take.\n\n\u201cOur position on this is informed on the facts that some of the advocates of restructuring are at the same time advocating the dissolution of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAre they believers in Nigeria at all?

          "text": "\u2022Abacha\u2019s $311m refund intact, says Orji\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), manager of Nigeria\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), yesterday announced its audited results for its 2020 financial year, reflecting a strong financial performance and consistent implementation of strategic infrastructure investment programmes for the year.\n\nThe results showed that despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year under review, the NSIA recorded 343 per cent growth in its total income, which rose to N160.06 billion in 2020, up from the N36.15 billion in the previous year.\n\nAlso, excluding devaluation gain of N51 billion, the NSIA made a core income of N109 billion compared to N33.07 billion in 2019.\n\nIn addition, it achieved 33 per cent growth in net assets to N772.75 billion, compared with the N579.54 billion it achieved in 2019.\n\nNSIA Managing Director, Mr. Uche Orji, said at a virtual media briefing yesterday that the organisation received an additional contribution of $250 million and provided the first stabilisation support to the federal government of $150 million withdrawn from the Stabilisation Fund, in the year under review.\n\nSimilarly, the NSIA received $311 million from funds recovered from late Gen. Sani Abacha from the United States Department of Justice and Island of Jersey for funding of Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) projects such as Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 adversely affected logistics around infrastructure projects, especially the toll road projects, and the presidential fertiliser initiative. In response to COVID-19, NSIA partnered Global Citizen, a not-for-profit group, to form the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund. Separately NSIA acquired and distributed oxygen concentrators to 21 teaching hospitals as part of corporate social responsibility, in addition to staffing support to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19,\u201d Orji said.\n\nGiving a highlight on the activities of Nigeria Infrastructure Fund (NIF), he said projects under construction in the country had reached major milestones across domestic infrastructure projects in motorways, agriculture, and healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, in 2020, there were improved contributions from subsidiaries/affiliates such as Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company (InfraCredit), Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) and Family Homes Funds Ltd (FHFL).\n\nThe NSIA, he said, invested additional capital into NG Clearing, the first derivative clearing house in Nigeria to maintain NSIA\u2019s shareholding at 16.5 per cent following the company\u2019s rights issue of 2020.\n\nOrji said the NSIA in 2020 launched its Nigeria Innovation Fund to address investment opportunities within Nigeria in information technology with an immediate pipeline that included data networking, data centres, software, and services as well as agri-tech and biotech.\n\nIt also made progress on developing the ammonia and diammonium phosphate production plants in partnership with OCP in the review year, as it selected Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom as the venue after an extensive review of several other locations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the year under review, COVID-19 adversely impacted NSIA key infrastructure projects, with significant disruptions to the supply chains and logistics of NSIA\u2019s key projects. NSIA maintained its three-pronged investment approach: direct investments, co-investment with partners, and creation of financial institutions to fill critical institutional voids in the infrastructure landscape. In 2020 the Authority recorded significant progress on all fronts.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the Authority has invested significantly in crucial sub-sectors of the financial landscape with the intention of bridging critical voids that otherwise constrain investments and smooth operations in the sector.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the access roads to the Second Niger Bridge, 2A and 2B, 17.5 kilometres (Km) each (totaling 35km), were added to PIDF scope of work. \u201cThese had initially been part of scope expected to be carried out by the Federal Ministry of Works but owing to several challenges they have been unable to commence the projects leading to a transfer to the NSIA. The original scope of NSIA\u2019s section was 10.7KM of bridge and road, bringing the entire project to more than 45Km.\n\n\u201cAs of year-end 2020, the original scope of 10.7km Second Niger Bridge is at 53 per cent completion with a completion target of 2022. The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is at 66 per cent completion and is expected to be completed in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe initial scope of the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway is at 66 per cent completion. However, please note that the scope of the project has been expanded from the rehabilitation of 92.5km along the three sections of the road to the full reconstruction of the entire stretch of 375km, as directed by Mr. President; this has extended the completion date. The NSIA is exploring options to shorten the completion timeline for the project.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA ran the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) from December 2016 to December 2020, adding that the operator company \u2013 NAIC-NPK \u2013 has now been spun off to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI).\n\n\u201cThe Authority\u2019s role in the programme has shifted upstream. NSIA\u2019s role is limited to importation, storage, and the wholesale of raw materials to blenders. In essence, blenders are expected to build the capacity to actively participate in the sub-sector.\n\n\u201cOver the period it ran, 42 blending plants were enlisted under the programme while a total of 30 million 50kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 fertiliser were made available to the Nigerian farmers. Beyond serving a proof of concept for import substitution in the fertiliser space, the programme led to the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the agriculture value chain including in logistics, ports, bagging, rail, industrial warehousing, and haulage touchpoints amongst others. It also enabled the country to conserve foreign exchange that would have otherwise been used for subsidy payment,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on his outlook for 2021, he said the NSIA would raise fund by issuing a Sukuk bond.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAlthough NSIA believes the market is unlikely to repeat some of the performance of 2020, it is more likely that a broader market recovery will occur with economies opening unlike the case in 2020 in which technology stocks drove market performance.\n\n\u201cIn the Future Generations Fund, we expect to allocate more capital to venture capital, global equity markets, and increasing exposure to European equities where we had been underexposed in 2020. NSIA believes that the broad opening of the markets will provide a comprehensive lift to equities.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the Innovation Fund is expected to be very active as we see opportunities in data centers, data networking, software, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and many others.\n\n\u201cNSIA expects to complete concession, capital raise and operationalisation of the three PIDF road projects: Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway.\n\n\u201cDespite concerns around new waves of COVID-19, the Authority remains confident that with widespread vaccination programmes, global economies will continue to reopen and create more opportunities to create value by the NSIA.\u201d\n\nOrji also shed more light on the NSIA\u2019s financial performance when he appeared yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe explained that some of the NSIA\u2019s portfolios were up by as much as 50 per cent in dollar terms in 2020, predicting that although the financial technology sector ruled the market last year, there will be a broader profit ecosystem this year as countries continue to open up on the back of increasing COVID-19 vaccine jabs.\n\nAccording to him, the body has been aggressive in terms of its focus on international equities, private equity investments, venture capital and direct investments in the international market, where much of the profits came from.\n\nHe said with the exception of just one or two portfolios, every single asset class made substantial returns to the NSIA last year, with net profit of N108.9 billion.\n\nHe predicted a broader recovery for the equity side of the investments this year, saying that although stock market growth in 2020 was largely anchored on technology, activities in 2021 will be driven by aviation and the industrial sectors as the world opens up again.\n\nUche stated that fixed income should be closely watched by investors, except for the impact of inflation, which he predicted would make interest rates go up and make fixed income instruments fall.\n\n\u201cMy view is that on the balance of risk, we are more likely to see interest rates go up than go down,\u201d he added, noting that venture capitalist funds are also being explored by the organisation.\n\n\u201cOn the average, we had almost 30 per cent returns in dollar terms and we are going to be more aggressive in venture capital,\u201d he said.\n\nUche stated that the NSIA is also investing in fintech, software services, data networking as well as biotech and pharmaceuticals.\n\nBesides, the NSIA has also intervened in the diagnostics and radiology centres in Kano and Umuahia and the cancer centres at the Lagos Nigeria University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).\n\nIt is also discussing with the University College, London, to develop pharmaceutical industries in Nigeria.\n\nOn the Abacha loot, he stated: \u201cThe Abacha fund was $311 million that was returned to Nigeria by the US Department of Justice and Island of Jersey and the agreement was to spread the money in equal measures across three projects.\n\n\u201cThese are the Lagos-Ibadan Road, Abuja-Kano Road and the Second Niger Bridge. Each of them will get $103million-$104 million. To spend the money, we have been required to have external auditors aside from our in-house auditors as Deloitte to monitor the disbursement of that fund.\n\n\u201cA civil society group, CLEEN foundation has been appointed by the Ministry of Justice and also with the US government to also supervise the disbursement of the fund. So, you can imagine that every single pair of eyes possible are overlooking how these funds will be disbursed.\n\n\u201cThe fund is still there intact. Not a dime has been spent. It is being held in our accounts with the central bank.\u201d\n\nHe added that another \u20ac4.2 was being expected to be repatriated, which the authorities have agreed should come to the NSIA to be used for the three projects.\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA is planning to invest more in healthcare sector this year, with the ramping up of infrastructure in Abuja and an eye on 20 such centres nationwide.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Also, excluding devaluation gain of N51 billion, the NSIA made a core income of N109 billion compared to N33.07 billion in 2019.\n\u201cCOVID-19 adversely affected logistics around infrastructure projects, especially the toll road projects, and the presidential fertiliser initiative.\nGiving a highlight on the activities of Nigeria Infrastructure Fund (NIF), he said projects under construction in the country had reached major milestones across domestic infrastructure projects in motorways, agriculture, and healthcare.\nHe said: \u201cIn the year under review, COVID-19 adversely impacted NSIA key infrastructure projects, with significant disruptions to the supply chains and logistics of NSIA\u2019s key projects.\n\u201cIn the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the Innovation Fund is expected to be very active as we see opportunities in data centers, data networking, software, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and many others.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nAn indigenous firm, UTM Offshore Limited, has signed a deal with Japan Gas Corporation (JGC), a leading international Engineering Design, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm, to establish a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility, the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\nThis followed the issuance of licence by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to establish the FLNG facility.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited took a major step to actualise the project yesterday, signing virtually, a landmark preliminary front end engineering design (Pre-FEED) agreement with JGC.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the Pre-FEED scope would be completed within four months from commencement date.\n\nUTM has also engaged Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) of the UK to provide owner\u2019s engineering services on the project.\n\nKBR is to provide due diligence on the JGC scope by conducting a third-party review of all deliverables from JGC during the Pre-FEED.\n\nSpeaking at the virtual signing event, the Managing Director of UTM Offshore Limited, Mr. Julius Rone, said JGC Corporation came highly recommended given the several similar projects the firm had undertaken across the world.\n\n\u201cWhat UTM is doing is largely novel. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria and we are very excited about this trail-blazing project: The opportunity to build from the scratch, the first floating liquefied natural gas facility in Nigeria is humongous. That is why we cannot afford to settle for less hence our resolve to contract JGC Corporation, one of the leading firms in the LNG Construction sector in the world, to provide the Pre-Front End Engineering Design Services for this first Floating LNG facility in Nigeria,\u201d Rone said.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited is pioneering the development of the FLNG facility in collaboration with LNG Investment Management Services (LIMS), a subsidiary of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe facility, a newly-built vessel, will receive gas feedstock from an existing offshore facility, treat it to required LNG standard, liquefy the gas, store the LNG and offload to LNG carriers.\n\nAccording to Rone, the floating LNG, when fully completed shall have an LNG production capacity of 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa), Turret and Mooring System, Gas pre-treatment modules, LNG production modules, living quarters, self-contained power generation and utilities as well as capacities for LNG storage and offloading.\n\nAt the landmark agreement signing event, Rone thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for creating an enabling environment for indigenous firms like UTM Offshore to equitably operate in the very sensitive and competitive upstream sector of the petroleum industry.\n\nHe said that the resolve of UTM Offshore to embark on the huge project is steeped in the National Gas Policy of the Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nRone said: \u201cAt UTM Offshore, we completely agree with Mr. President that given Nigeria\u2019s potential of about 600 trillion cubic feet of gas, the commodity has the enormous potential to diversify our country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe also agree that the rising global demand for cleaner energy sources has offered Nigeria an opportunity to exploit gas resources for the good of the country.\n\n\u201cWe thank the president for making gas development and utilization a national priority to stimulate economic growth, further improve Nigeria\u2019s energy mix, drive investments, and provide the much-needed jobs for our citizens in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, for tenaciously driving Mr. President\u2019s vision in the petroleum sector, particularly the gas policy.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to key players in the national petroleum industry, notably the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, and the Director of Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Mr. Sarki Auwalu, for their support for the FLNG project.\n\nAccording to him, other partners and critical stakeholders that are supporting the FLNG project include Afreximbank, NAPIMS, Templars, Vitol, Yahaska Energy Services Limited and the government of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI am particularly thankful to the visionary Governor of Delta State, His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who from Day One, believed in our dream of building the first Floating LNG in Nigeria and has been of immense support since then.\n\n\u201cWe cannot thank him enough. Indeed, we are assuring all our partners and stakeholders that we will not let them down,\u201d Rone said.\n\nAuwalu, who attended the event virtually lauded Rone and his team for blazing the trail in building Nigeria first Floating LNG. He said: \u201cIt is a historic event today as UTM Offshore working with our support is actualizing Mr. President vision not just for gas and the diversification of our economy.\n\n\u201cMr. President has promised to migrate Nigeria to gas and that is what UTM Offshore is doing with the decision to build and operate and FLNG. It is a tortuous process but I can confirm that UTM Offshore has met all the requirements and that is why DPR gave the firm license to proceed with the building of the FLNG.\n\n\u201cAt DPR we have been monitoring closely what UTM is doing and we are very happy that they are working with the best firms and consultants in the world, in fact, first-class and globally renowned firms are working with UTM Offshore to actualize this FLNG. DPR shall continue to guide and encourage UTM on this project.\u201d\n\nAn executive of JGC Corporation of Japan, Mr. Koji Sakrai, praised the vision and tenacity of Rone and his firm, pledging the commitment of his company to deploy the latest and cost-effective engineering design and constructions modules in undertaking the project and assured that the task would be completed within schedule.\n\nPresent at the agreement signing were the representatives of the GMD of NNPC, Mr. Abubakar Umar; representatives of Vitol, Mr. Chibuzor Ifeanyi; while Mr. Steve Brown also of Vitol joined virtually.\n\nAn Executive Director, Afrexim Bank, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna, joined virtually, while Mr. Peter Olowononi and Mrs Ngozi Kalu-Mba, also from the bank attended the event.\n\nSpecial Adviser on Investments to the Delta State Governor, Mr. Paul Nma, represented the governor, while Dr. Yahuza Kassim, who made a detailed presentation on the FLNG project represented Yahuza Energy Services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The issue of insecurity is unique to each zone.

A number of people who are coming into Lagos are turning positive on day seven. Those individuals, by nationality, are Nigerians returning from countries into Lagos.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see an individual that has turned positive, and is typically isolating at home. That makes the members of that household, no matter how careful they are, vulnerable to contracting the virus.\n\n\u201cSo, in the ring strategy, when we get somebody that has turned positive who has recently returned from abroad, we will deploy some of the vaccines to vaccinate members of their family and their immediate household, to stop the transmission of the virus from the traveller to family members or people that live in the same home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to use these extra vaccines that we\u2019re getting from Abuja in an intelligent way, to really add to our attempt to stop this virus from coming into Lagos.\n\n\u201cBut if it does come into Lagos through a traveller, we\u2019ll stop it from being transmitted to their household members and from the household members into the community. This is a very effective strategy that has been deployed in Ebola; it has been deployed in the past for small pox, and we believe if we\u2019re able to deploy it here, it will add to our strategy to reduce the opportunity for Lagosians to experience a third wave.\u201d",

          "text": "Seyi Shay, R&B singer, has explained how she handles trolls on Twitter immediately after an episode of Nigerian Idol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 35-year-old songwriter had been on the receiving end of a heated backlash on the microblogging platform in March after she bluntly condemned the rendition of an aspiring artiste.\n\nShay, who is one of the judges for the show\u2019s 6th season alongside DJ Sose and Obi Asika, had said that the teenager shouldn\u2019t have auditioned as he \u201ccan\u2019t make money being a singer.\u201d\n\nAs clips from the show spread, Nigerians on Twitter had tackled Seyi Shay after which the teenager opened up on being \u201cbroken emotionally\u201d by her verdict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few days after eleven contestants made it to the finals, Seyi Shay reacted to the criticism she has faced so far during a chat with HipTV.\n\nShe also explained that she avoids Twitter for a week immediately after an episode of the reality singing competition show has been aired.\n\n\u201cNormally I just ignore trolls. I don\u2019t actually read a lot of Twitter comments especially right after an episode of Nigerian Idol has just aired. I give my Twitter a week before I go on it and read or write anything,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on her method of handing out verdicts, the singer said: \u201cI think people who watch the show from start to finish understand my mode of judging. I think that intellects understand. No pun intended. I know that we as Nigerians don\u2019t tend to read, study, listen, or research.\n\n\u201cWe tend to jump on the bandwagon of whatever we think is trendy at the moment. We\u2019re not really used to the truth yet and I think something should be done about it. I\u2019m playing my part; I\u2019m quite blunt anyway and honest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frank. I don\u2019t care. If you\u2019re not good enough, then you\u2019re not good. If you\u2019re good, you\u2019re great. Finally, we\u2019ve gotten to our top 11 contestants and I think that those were the best out of thousands we had to audition.\u201d\n\nSeyi also disclosed that viewers might have missed out on her reassuring comments to the contestant as the show is edited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Nigerians can see why we were so harsh. We had to choose the cream and we\u2019ve gotten them. Don\u2019t forget that these shows are edited a lot and so many don\u2019t get to see the full context of what\u2019s going on,\u201d the singer added.\n\n\u201c\u2026unless you watch the Nigerian Idols Extra and see the full recording. So if I say something like, \u2018you\u2019re not good enough\u2019 or \u2018you can\u2019t make money being a singer\u2019, I may have added \u2018\u2026but you\u2019ll make money being a songwriter\u2019.\n\n\u201cHowever, that part may have been edited out for whatever triggers the producers wanted. As the only woman on the panel, I feel like I was singled out for that controversy. But it\u2019s all good. It\u2019s a job. I\u2019m getting paid to do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "title": "Seerbit\u2019s Omoniyi Kolade wants financial inclusion for all Africans",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I learned two things about the man. He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

Whilst career aspirations may differ, there is a shared understanding that more women need to be involved in tech-related sectors, to meet the growing need for constant innovation across the world and addressing the topic of gender inclusiveness.\n\nWomen\u2019s month celebrated globally provides an opportunity to showcase female-focused initiatives to empower and drive growth for women. Amongst the several initiatives launched this year to celebrate International Women\u2019s day, Bolt introduced its Drive4WI Tech (Drive for Women In Tech) initiative to support women in building a career in technology. The initiative is an internship programme for young women who choose to start a career in technology regardless of their existing educational background.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, 9 interns were selected from Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. The goal for Bolt is to equip these interns, with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nThe interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests with three lucky Nigerians \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji, Miracle Nebo and Oluwakorede Oseni selected in the tightly contested programme.\n\nThe journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing talking point of discussion, largely influenced by cultural norms to societal expectations in relation to gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and is fulfilling its commitments to include more women in tech. The internship is a hands-on experience that gives the interns an opportunity to . The company has designed a curriculum to immerse its interns in their various departments and get the chance to work closely with highly skilled industry experts for the period.\n\nTech is key to development in Nigeria and Africa.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "In March 2020, the Guardian reported that Facebook was exploring a parent-controlled experience of Instagram for children under 13 years. Following the announcement, a campaign for a commercial-free childhood addressed a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook Chief Executive Officer, in April, to cancel the plan to launch the Instagram for children platform.\n\nIn the dual-party letter signed by the attorneys general representing 44 US states and territories, they are persuading Facebook to terminate the plan to open Instagram for children since the Instagram app was not designed for children.\n\nThe officials said that social media use could be harmful to the health and well-being of children who are not armed to navigate the challenges of using a social media account. They also reported that Facebook has failed to protect the welfare of children across its platforms.\n\nA Facebook spokesman said that the tech giant just started exploring the version of Instagram for kids, and it\u2019s promising not to show ads in any Instagram experience developed for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the letter, the company\u2019s stance on Facebook\u2019s Messenger Kids app didn\u2019t fill them with confidence. In the bipartisan letter, as reported by TechCrunch, the AG said that a 2019 media report revealed that the app designed for children between the ages of 6 and 12 contained a notable design error that permitted children to avoid restrictions on online interactions and join group chats with strangers not approved by their parents.\n\nIn theory, building kid-safe platforms is a form of inclusiveness. For example, global streaming service, Netflix, updated its Kids\u2019 profile in April, making it more graphic. When kids log in to their account, their favourite titles and characters welcome them at the top right corner of the screen.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t a new development, one wonders why Facebook is being persuaded to cancel the kids\u2019 app.\n\nMaura Healey, Massachusetts Attorney General, tweeted, \u201cFacebook has repeatedly failed to protect the health and wellbeing of children on its platforms. \u2018Instagram for kids\u2019 is a shameful attempt to exploit and profit off vulnerable people. I\u2019m leading a letter to Mark Zuckerberg with 44 AGs to demand they abandon this plan.\u201d\n\nA Comparitech report reveals that one-fifth of all bullying occurs through social media. With cyberbullying prevalent across all social media platforms, it stands to reason that having kids on Instagram would expose them to such risks.\n\nOn average, 7 in 10 young people experience cyberbullying before turning 18, and 56% of online harassment reportedly happens on Facebook. Also, 61% of teenagers who reported being bullied said it was because of their appearance. Possibly, rejecting Instagram for kids is to reduce incidences of cyberbullying among children as it\u2019s more of picture-sharing.\n\nThe AG pointed out that Facebook is not responding to a need but creating a need. Therefore, it\u2019s not certain if Facebook or other tech giants would be permitted to develop another app for kids.\n\nRecall that in 2019, 46 attorneys general commenced their antitrust investigation into Facebook after it agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a government probe over a series of privacy crimes. The following year, some investigators were expected to file antitrust charges against the tech giant. This seems like a recurrence since the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerchance, these outstanding cases could be responsible for the scrutiny and pressure to scratch Instagram for kids.\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

I\u2019m leading a letter to Mark Zuckerberg with 44 AGs to demand they abandon this plan.\u201d\n\nA Comparitech report reveals that one-fifth of all bullying occurs through social media. With cyberbullying prevalent across all social media platforms, it stands to reason that having kids on Instagram would expose them to such risks.\n\nOn average, 7 in 10 young people experience cyberbullying before turning 18, and 56% of online harassment reportedly happens on Facebook. Also, 61% of teenagers who reported being bullied said it was because of their appearance. Possibly, rejecting Instagram for kids is to reduce incidences of cyberbullying among children as it\u2019s more of picture-sharing.\n\nThe AG pointed out that Facebook is not responding to a need but creating a need. Therefore, it\u2019s not certain if Facebook or other tech giants would be permitted to develop another app for kids.\n\nRecall that in 2019, 46 attorneys general commenced their antitrust investigation into Facebook after it agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a government probe over a series of privacy crimes. The following year, some investigators were expected to file antitrust charges against the tech giant. This seems like a recurrence since the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerchance, these outstanding cases could be responsible for the scrutiny and pressure to scratch Instagram for kids.\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "On Monday, May 10, 2021, Practical Product \u2014 a community of product leaders and enthusiasts \u2014 released a State Of Product Management In Africa Report (PDF) based on a survey carried out between February 15 and March 1, 2021.\n\nResponses were gathered from 215 project managers working in Africa, with many surveyed responses from the fintech industry. Others included traditional finance institutions, edtech, healthtech, and agritech.\n\nThis report documented the state of project management in the continent. Among other things considered, gender discrepancy in the project management field stood out.\n\nOver the last decade, Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem has experienced commendable growth. From the rise of startups in varying fields of technology to inter-continental expansions, the future is very promising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomewhat ironically, this growth has been characterised by the slow-paced inclusiveness of women in tech. The survey revealed that men outnumber women in Africa\u2019s project management sector by almost 150%, reflecting patterns observed in the broader tech scope.\n\nAlthough we have women championing great feats in Africa\u2019s tech field, the man-woman dichotomy could use some balance.\n\nOf the 215 project managers surveyed, ~129 (59.8%) identified as men and ~85 (39.7%) as women. Less than 1% of respondents preferred not to disclose their gender.\n\nMoving on to ranks, women hold 45% of PM positions and 26% of senior PM positions. Only 25% of women hold VP/head of products positions. On average, men hold 74% of the senior roles.\n\nThe report also stated that ~93 (43%) \u2014 ~27 women (29%) and ~65 (70%) men \u2014 of the 215 respondents earn $1,000/month.\n\nFor job satisfaction of the surveyed respondents, 74% of men (~96) and 54% of women (~37) felt happy with their jobs.\n\nFourteen per cent of female Assistant Product Managers (APMs) expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs, with reasons ranging from feeling less supported on the job to a lack of clarity in career path to not being well paid.\n\nThe gulf between men and women in the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem is still worth discussing. Many times we have explored this issue, told the stories of notable personalities and looked at practical ways to bridge the gap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven as the tech industry burgeons in Africa, we hope that this imbalance and existing stereotypes are eroded. At the day\u2019s end, differing biological characteristics are not determinants for mental and skill-learning capabilities.\n\nThe Practical Product report surveyed skills, compensation, and general well being in Africa\u2019s project management sector, with issues like lack of autonomy and hostile work environment cited as major challenges faced by many project managers.\n\nSome countries that participated in the survey include Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nFeatured image credits: Christina Morillo from Pexels\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

The effectiveness of this move depends on the synergy between the Governors, the Legislators and the people including the civil society organizations.\u201d\n\nThe group also encouraged the governors to carry the people of Southern Kaduna and the Middle Belt along, as according it, their fate and that of Southern Nigeria are interwoven.\n\n\u201cADF wishes to draw the attention of the Southern Governors and Legislators to the obvious fact that our fate in the current struggle for survival is intricately interwoven with the fate of our fellow compatriots in the Middle Belt and Southern Kaduna,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cADF notes the gallant and courageous resistance against the jihadist propensities in the Middle Belt by the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom.

Our TCN partners are working to restore supply immediately. Please bear with us.\u201d\n\nConfirming the incident officially, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said there was a total system collapse of the grid, as a result of voltage collapse at some parts of the grid.\n\nIn a statement signed by its general manager, public affairs, Ndidi Mbah, TCN commenced grid recovery immediately after the collapse, from Shiroro Generating Station to Katampe TS, Abuja through the Shiroro \u2013 Katampe line at 11:29 am, and also through Delta Generating Station to Benin Transmission Substation, up to Osogbo and parts of Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhile the grid restoration and power restoration gradually progress to other parts of the country, the cause of voltage collapse that precipitated this failure is equally being investigated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTCN appeals for patience as it works assiduously to ensure full restoration of the grid and consequently power supply to the remaining parts of the country,\u201d Ndidi noted.\n\nShe said, while the grid restoration gradually progresses to other parts of the country, the commission has launched investigation into the cause of the voltage collapse that precipitated the failure.\n\nThe commission also appealed to Nigerians to be patient as adequate measures are being made to restore electricity across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, electricity is being gradually restored to parts of Lagos state. Already, Eko Electricity Distribution company confirmed it received power from one of its stations at 12:25pm.\n\nThe DisCo said that whenever there\u2019s a collapse, they don\u2019t restore all at the same time to prevent another collapse. What happens is that they start restoring each of the transmission stations one after the other so as to ensure stability, one of its technal officers told LEADERSHIP.\n\nThe grid, which is being managed by government-owned TCN, has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amidst lack of spinning reserve that is capable of forestalling such occurrences.",

He should leave every other things and concentrate on security. That means even if they will stop paying us (Lawmakers) and use the money to tackle insecurity. Is it not when you are secured that you talk of other things? It is not only the politicians but everybody.\n\n\u201cIf you know that you cannot move out of your house and they say sacrifice your salary, won\u2019t you do it? Many people are working from home, yet they are being paid. They should stop paying salaries and address the whole issue of insecurity. If you (government) don\u2019t have money, stop paying salaries and allowances and use the money to provide security,\u201d Ndume advised.\n\nHe wondered that if the federal government could borrow money to provide infrastructure, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we borrow money to protect our people?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNdume noted that adequate funds were immediately needed to provide sophisticated weapons and kits for the troops at the war fronts in order for them to effectively prosecute the war against insurgency.\n\nOn the foiled attempt by the Boko Haram terrorists to attack Maiduguri, the Borno State capital on Tuesday evening, Ndume commended the combined team of security forces who promptly responded and neutralised the attackers.\n\n\u201cI commend the armed forces operating in Maiduguri for their gallant response to the attack by the Boko Haram on Tuesday evening around 6pm. A group of Boko Haram insurgents wanted to infiltrate Maiduguri but the armed forces responded swiftly and neutralise and repelled the insurgents. I understand that most of the insurgents were killed.\n\n\u201cThe Army, Airforce, Police and the Civilian JTF played a very significant role in repelling the insurgents. If such reaction from the armed forces is sustained, the insurgents would be repelled whenever they surface anywhere in the North-East,\u201d Ndume added.",

          "text": "By Chibuzo Ukaibe, Abuja\n\nAs the Muslim faithful mark the Eid-al-fitr festival, a former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, and the immediate past Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, have called for unity among Nigerians and the need for continuous prayer for Nigeria in light of the security crisis and economic hardships.\n\nSimilarly, a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi and a presidential candidate in the 2019 general election, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, have also called for peace and for all stakeholders in the Nigerian project to unite in the interest of the country.\n\nAtiku in a statement he personally signed said this year\u2019s Eid-al-fitr was coming at a time when Nigeria is going through a challenging moment concerning the security of lives and property and when a large number of people are hard hit by the ravaging scourge of poverty.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, we need to remind ourselves of our obligation to ensuring peace and unity within our family and in our neighbourhood at all times. Today, across Nigeria, there is a scary and growing tendency to mistrust along ethnic and religious lines. As Muslims, we know from both the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Noble Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that no tribe or race is superior to another, except the one that seeks piety to the Almighty Allah.\n\n\u201cWe do not attain piety through hate or blood-letting. We attain piety through forbearance and by sharing love. That is the message that we must give some reflection as we celebrate Eid today,\u201d the former VP said.\n\nFor his part, congratulating Muslims in Nigeria and across the world on the occasion of Eid-el-Fitr festival, Saraki advised Nigerians to continue with their closeness to Almighty Allah and their prayers for His intervention in the affairs of the country, even after the obligatory fasting period.\n\nIn a statement signed by his special adviser and head of his media office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, Saraki said: \u201cThe current situation in our country requires sincere change of mindset by all Nigerians. We should use this post-Ramadan period and the lessons we learnt from the fasting period to steer clear of any action which does not bode well for our country. This is a period when we all need to pray to Allah to once again pull the country back from the precipice.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201c With the level of insecurity and economic crisis which have combined to worsen the rate of poverty in Nigeria, all Nigerians must unite and demonstrate patriotism that will help our country overcome the present challenges.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I commend our security agencies at the frontline and pray that Almighty God will protect and give them victory over the insurgents and other non-state actors inflicting violence on our country. May Allah heal our land of any form of affliction.\u201d\n\nAlso, former Anambra governor and vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, Mr Peter Obi, however, charged Nigerians not to allow the prevailing hardship and mounting insecurity in the country to adversely affect their spirit of love, brotherliness and peaceful co-existence.\n\nObi said the people should rather use this year\u2019s Eid-el-Fitr festivities to engender the spirit of oneness and also re-dedicate themselves to the virtues of love, patriotism and unity for the desired national development.\n\nObi in a statement from his media office, noted that Nigerians should allow the solemnness of the last one month of Ramadan to positively influence their thoughts and actions in relating with one another.\n\nAccording to him, the Ramadan period presents a great opportunity for Nigerians to devote themselves to the values that unite and bind all citizens in love, while permanently putting behind them all divisive tendencies.\n\nOn his part, former presidential candidate in the 2019 election, Olawepo-Hashim called on political leaders and other stakeholders to unite and save Nigeria from imminent collapse.\n\nHe said political leaders in the country, irrespective of their political or ideological leanings should put heads together in order to agree on a workable agenda to stabilise the nation.\n\nOlawepo-Hashim said, \u201cThe nation is on fire and we must put it out Right Now! Nigeria\u2019s political leaders across political lines in government and out of government must urgently arrive at a consensus to secure the country and return it to a path of peace and unity so as to give hope to the citizens who desperately need to be assured that their father land can still work for them.\u201d",

          "text": "Ellen DeGeneres, a staple of daytime American talk show culture, said Wednesday she is ending her show after 19 seasons.\n\nThe 63-year-old host, writer, producer, actress and comedian won dozens of Emmy awards for the show and has been a pioneer of the LGBTQ community in America since she came out as gay in 1997. That revelation shocked America and nearly doomed her career.\n\nShe insisted her decision to bring the curtain down on the daytime show named after her has nothing to do with allegations in the past year of a toxic workplace environment there, including bullying, racial discrimination and sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a creative person, you constantly need to be challenged. And as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it\u2019s just not a challenge anymore,\u201d DeGeneres told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhen the complaints from staffers working on the show came out, DeGeneres acknowledged there were problems and pledged to do better.\n\n\u201cIt almost impacted the show,\u201d Ellen told the trade publication. \u201cIt was very hurtful to me. I mean, very. But if I was quitting the show because of that, I wouldn\u2019t have come back this season.\u201d\n\nTiming her departure is something DeGeneres has openly wrestled with in the past. In a 2018 New York Times profile, she revealed that her actress wife, Portia de Rossi, had been encouraging her to move on from the 180-shows-a-year gig, while her comedian brother, along with executives at Warner Bros., had urged her to continue. In the end, DeGeneres signed on for three more seasons but was clear with herself and her team that this contract \u2014 which would take her well beyond 3,000 shows, and a stunning 2,400 celebrity interviews \u2014 would be her last.\n\nOn the heels of a series of personal swipes that DeGeneres says \u201cdestroyed\u201d her, came a July BuzzFeed News expose detailing allegations of a toxic workplace. The latter, which DeGeneres says she learned about through the press, prompted an internal investigation and the dismissal of key executives.\n\nThe host, who\u2019s built her brand on the motto \u201cBe Kind,\u201d opened season 18 in September with a lengthy apology, telling viewers, \u201cI learned that things happen here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously. And I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected.\u201d\n\nWhile the mea culpa was widely viewed \u2013 Ellen\u2019s highest-rated premiere in years, according to The New York Times.\n\nDeGeneres is believed to have been considering ending the show for several years.\n\nShe is scheduled for a television interview with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday to talk about ending the program.\n\nThe final episode is scheduled for the spring of 2022.",
