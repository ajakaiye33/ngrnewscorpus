          "title": "Be active beyond social media, Fayemi urges youths",
          "text": "The Chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has advised Nigerian youths to quit social media politics and get involved in real politics that will connect them with the people if they are serious about effecting\n\nchanges in the country.\n\nFayemi, who is the Ekiti State Governor, said this in the goodwill message he delivered in Ibadan on Friday at the National Security and Peace symposium to mark the 45th birthday of a member of House of Representatives, representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Iwajowa/Kajola Federal Constituency, Shina Peller.\n\nHe said Peller had performed creditably well and had impacted the lives of the people of his constituency, the state and the country, saying the youths should emulate him.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf we want to make a difference, our young ones cannot just remain Twitter revolutionaries. They have to be on the ground, they have to be in their wards, they have to be in their constituencies. They have to be involved in real politics with the people in order to really connect themselves beyond just writing and be active on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\u201cThey have to cease to be paper weight politicians by being in the midst of the people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the insecurity in the country, Fayemi said Nigeria could overcome its challenges with sincerity and determination to tackle the problem.\n\nHe stated that countries with worse problems than these overcame theirs because they were sincere about solving their problems.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cOur country is going through a lot of challenges but these challenges are not insurmountable. They are challenges that can be overcome. Countries that have been in far deeper problem in the past overcame their challenges.\n\n\u201cIf we are singleminded and demonstrate sincerity of purpose, if we are committed about transforming Nigeria for the better and understanding our challenges, if we are honest, purpose driven and determined, we will put behind us, all the triggers of violence in the land be it insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery,\n\n\u201cAs long as we are tough on the crime and criminality, we must also be tough on the causes of the crime. We all know those causes of the crime that have been in our country.\n\n\u201cInequality is clearly a major cause, poverty is another and unemployment is the one we all see. When you see what my brother (Peller) has done in the House of Representatives and in his constituency in terms of poverty eradication, in terms of community empowerment and bridging the gap between the privileged and the less privileged in our community, you will know that this is an indication of what he can do if he is saddled with higher responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe Dean, Multi-disciplinary Studies, University of Ibadan, Prof. Olawale Albert, who was the guest lecturer said Nigeria had become a huge slaughter slab and that no part of it was safe as criminals daily roam about killing, manning and kidnapping many.\n\nAlbert said, \u201cOn the balance, it is argued here that there is little the international community can do to help Nigeria when the country is not doing enough to help itself. Hence, what matters most at this moment is for Nigeria now to start investing more on its whole of nation, society and nation approaches.\n\n\u201cThe most strategic is the whole of the national approach. Once a nation is formed from the multiplicity of sub-nationalities now competing for the ownership and management of Nigeria, every other things would fall in place. In other words, the country must first become a nation for the whole of the government and other approaches to work.\n\n\u201cHaving sustainable peace and security in this respect requires doing everything that could be done to win back the hearts and minds of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians are disappointed with how the country has been mismanaged over the years. For now, Nigerians do not believe in themselves and their leaders. More annoying to the people is the way Nigerian leaders seek to turn deceits into a philosophy of governance.\u201d\n\nSome of the dignitaries present at the lecture were wife of Senator Abiola Ajimobi, Florence; the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adeyunji; the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi; Senator Teslim Folarin, former Minister of Communication, Adebayo Shittu among others.",

          "text": "The pan Ijaw youths group from the Nine States of the Niger Delta, Ijaw Youth Congress(IYC) worldwide, has warned against provocations by the Nigerian government on the people of the region that may strigger the reenactment of the 12 days revolution declared in 1966 by the ijaw hero, Major Isaac Jasper Adaka Boro to secede Nigeria.\n\nThe group also protested against neglect and deprivation of the region by the Federal Government.\n\nIYC further stated that the only way to stop the need to secede is for President Muhammadu Buhari administration to immediately constitute the Substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), proper restructuring and true federalism..\n\nThe Ijaw Youths, said though the Niger Delta region have remained peaceful despite the clamored to draw attention to the plight of the Niger Delta region, the continued refusal of the Buhari administration to accede to the Niger Delta people demands may force the region re-enact the drama which led to the \u201c12 days revolution\u201d declaration of a republic against injustice, lack of fair play in infrastructural development and political status of the region.\n\nAccording to the spokesman of the council, Comrade Ebilade Ekerefe in a statement in Yenagoa on Sunday to commemorate the 53rd remembrance of the Ijaw hero, Major Isaac Jasper Adaka Boro, said the region is ready to confront the President Buhari led administration if it fails to respect the 30 days ultimatum handed the Federal Government on the 25th of April,2021.\n\n\u201cWe should not also forget his vision of a Niger Delta Region that should be economically independent to transform its landscape with its resources which many believed were being used to develop other parts of the country at the expense of the Niger Delta. Boro, like the Ijaw Youths, clamored and drew attention to the plight of the Niger Delta region, and possibly, set it free from the dominance of other major ethnic groups\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoro\u2019s vision, and the visions of our forefathers, seems to have moved from violent revolution, armed agitation to intellectual agitations. But the Nigerian Government seems to have developed a \u201csteel heart\u201d towards the calls by the people of the Niger Delta region. Despite their colored and window dressing of the issues in response to years of agitation, and the ego creation of interventionist agencies, which they acceded to and now controlled politically and financially, the Federal Government has become a \u201cPharaoh\u201d to the Niger Delta people. They created the NDDC, the Presidential Amnesty Programme and a few others to corrupt the political class in the region and weaken these institutions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Ijaw Youths Council (IYC), with the support of critical stakeholders, have never taken the issues bedeviling our region with kid gloves. We have agitated through successive National Executives of Council to clamor for the needed change that will fully actualize the vision of our hero- Major Isaac Jasper Adaka Boro.We also want to inform you, gentlemen of the Press, that the 30 days ultimatum handed President Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government on April 25th still subsists. We are ready and will not back down from demanding the immediate reconstitution of the Substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have stated that the people of the region took strong exception to the politics of personal interests that has delayed the inauguration of a substantive Board. When it comes to the issue of the Niger Delta people, the response is politicized. What is the forensic audit that PWC (PriceWaterHouseCoopers) didn\u2019t do in NNPC? Did the Board step aside? No!. The Board was there, investigations were done, and they did their report.\u201d\n\n\u201c If the frivolous excuse of the Buhari led administration on NDDC is Forensic Audit. What excuse would they present for the delay in the completion of the East-West road. Many travelers have died irrespective of their status. And many are still dying due to the deplorable condition of the road.\u201dAt the Presidential Amnesty office, the status of the substantive head has become interim with policy formulation handed to a stranger from the North under the cloak of the National Security Adviser. And the ex-agitators subjected to frequent change in policy and funding review\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a Council, and towing the line of our visionary hero, Jasper Adaka Boro. We are warning that despite our love for peace, may the Federal Government not let the region re-enact the drama which led to the \u201c12 days revolution\u201d against injustice, lack of fair play in infrastructural development and political status of the region. So far, the Ijaw Youths Council under the leadership of Deacon Timothy Igbefa would like to commend the South-South Governors position on some of the issues raised by the 17 Southern Governors in Asaba, Delta State. We commend them because some of the positions advocated by the Southern Governors are off-shoot of the position held by the South-South Governors under the vibrant leadership of His Excellency, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa\u201d.",

          "text": "Residents of Osogbo, the Osun State capital, have expressed divergent views to the planned increment of fares by commercial minibus drivers called \u2018Korope\u2019 from Monday, May 17, 2021, citing economic hardship in the country.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that some residents are in support of the hike, saying it is overdue while others believe the timing is not right because of the bad economy bedeviling the country.\n\nAccording to notices handed to passengers on Friday, the drivers\u2019 union stated that the fare, which stood at N50 to and from major routes in the city will be increased to N100, representing a 100 per cent hike.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the notice, which was written in Yoruba, read: \u201cThis is to inform all commercial mini bus drivers in Osogbo metropolis that as from Monday, May 17, the fare per drop is N100.\n\n\u201cAnyone who contravenes this increment will pay a fine of N5,000. This is the joint decision of all mini bus drivers (Korope) in Osogbo.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, a content creator based in the city, Adegbite Adedamola opined that, \u201cthe N100 per drop is just to start dragging from a vantage point. They will end up somewhere around N70 or N80 but come Monday, it is almost certain that korope fares are not going to be N50 anymore.\u201d\n\nOluwakemi Oginni in her reaction agreed with the union, explaining that the drivers have families to cater for and the cost of goods have skyrocketed.\n\nLatona Lolade echoed Oginni\u2019s opinion, saying, \u201ca brand new korope (minibus) sells for about N1.8 and N2 million and considering the rate of inflation at the moment, charging N100 per drop is not too much. If you are a bus owner, you will know it is long overdue.\u201d\n\nMuritala Kehinde based his support for the increment on the fact that prices of goods in the market have increased drastically.\n\nHowever, Jare Ismahil Tiamiyu, who disagreed with the increment, said it is outrageous, considering the fact that many people still haggle with the drivers over N30. He called on the state government to wade in before implementation of the hike commences on Monday.\n\nAdegoke Paul and Nile Oluwatoyin noted that charging N100 for a drop is too much, adding that commercial motorcyclists may follow suit.\n\nAnother resident, Ayodele Ojo, while expressing his displeasure with the hike, explained that the 100 per cent increment is too much since wages and salaries have not been increased.\n\nOther residents suggested the use of tricycles, popularly called \u2018keke NAPEP\u2019, to counter the minibus drivers\u2019 decision to increase their fare.\n\nThe government in their reaction declared that the announcement by the minibus operators as shocking as there was no prior notice from their leadership.\n\nEngr. Olatoke Olaniyan, the Special Adviser on Transport to the Osun State Governor, said, \u201cWe are communicating with them to suspend forthwith their intended action and inviting them for discussion on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe take cognisance of the fact that there has been a general increase in the prices of basic items in the country, we are of the opinion that such could not affect or attract a whopping 100% increase in the cost of transportation. We look forward to having a good landing with this segment of transport operators such as to ameliorate the cost of living of our people.\u201d\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the union proved abortive as many of the operators declined to speak on the issue.\n\nHowever, a driver, who pleaded anonymity, said that the general increase of goods and services in the country as well as the high cost of purchasing and maintenance of the minibuses forced the union to review the fare, which has been unchanged for up to decade.",

I am actually a survivor of rape. I understand what it means. When people talk about rape, I also want to air out my voice.\n\n\u201cAt the age of seven, I was gang raped; dressing has nothing to do with rape. What a woman wears cannot even push somebody to rape a woman? At the age of 10, I remember my uncle telling my mum he is going to send me to school and that was how they came, took me home and they sexually abused me from 10 to 12 years old.\n\nAt the age of 15, I was raped when I went to sell bananas for my mum. They finished eating the bananas and the groundnut and they still raped me. AT the age of 20, I was gangraped again when I went to sell garri. They raped me, collected the money, collected the garri.\n\nAt the age of 24, I was raped by my pastor who said he wanted to do deliverance for me and he did not do the deliverance. He raped me. Within five days, I was gangraped by a group of thieves who nearly destroyed my body. What did people say: \u201cdon\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nThey keep telling victims not to say anything.

          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nPrince Emmanuel Kanu is the brother of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nIn the interview, he took a swipe at the founder of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazurike over the latter\u2019s allegation that the IPOB leader sent his Eastern Security Network (ESN) men to assassinate him.\n\nHe equally opined that ESN was not formed to fight Biafrans, but those he described as terrorists in Biafran land. Excerpts:\n\nThe founder of MASSOB/BIM, Chief Ralph Uwazurike recently alleged that the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, sent his men to assassinate him. Could you react to the allegation?\n\nI will react to this with a question, What has lion got to do with a cockroach? It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nLet\u2019s be a bit serious, Uwazurike made a strong allegation that your brother sent killers to assassinate him. Could this be true?\n\nOne, my brother who is the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has no time to respond to him (Uwazurike). Secondly, ESN (Eastern Security Network) as it is, has nothing to do with Biafrans. Our target is the terrorists who have come to occupy our forests. Maybe Uwazurike has issues with one or two persons who are politicians, he should go and settle it with them and leave IPOB/ESN out of it. We don\u2019t see him as an enemy, but if he is a terrorist, he will be destroyed. He is not a terrorist, he is not an enemy, so, how would a sane person go after him? Not to talk of IPOB/ESN. That was why I said earlier that lion has no business with cockroach.\n\nHow do you react to other allegations Uwazurike made against your brother?\n\nWhich other allegations? I have reacted on the one I feel is relevant. Uwazurike feels he is no more relevant that\u2019s why he is making noise, thinking with that he will become relevant again.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Uwazurike\u2019s threat to arrest your brother if he steps into the country? Boasting he had done that before.\n\nWith such filthy environment, did you see his house? Who has given him such power to arrest the IPOB leader and take him to the forest he calls his home? Like I said earlier, Uwazurike is looking for relevance and he thinks by mentioning Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s name he will get it, but he\u2019s wasting his time.\n\nUwazurike also alleged that your brother was not genuinely fighting for Biafra, but was bought to scuttle his own movement. Is that true?\n\nIf Uwazurike had been honest with his agitation for Biafra, by now we would have long gone with the issue of Biafra agitation. The difference between him and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is that the IPOB leader has remained very consistent in his quest for Biafra restoration, whereas Uwazurike is after his personal interest. Let me tell you something, just like Nelson Mandela said, no freedom fighter stays in his home. Whether he is in prison or operating from exile, it\u2019s as simple as that. So, as far as Uwazurike remains in Imo State where he built his mansion, of course, he should focus on his business and do it, he should leave Mazi Nnamdi Kanu out of it, he has no time for him. Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s focus is on Biafra and nothing else.\n\nAre you saying the IPOB leader never planned to assassinate Uwazurike?\n\nFor us, in our own world, Uwazurike is irrelevant, nobody talks about him, he is a noise maker, nobody has his time for now. He wants money, I keep saying this, each time he wants money you see him talk. So, if they give him money now, he will stop talking; he\u2019s an attention seeker, that\u2019s what he is.",

          "text": "From David Onwuchekwa\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife has called for prayers to God, the creator, to intervene to solve the security challenges bedeviling Nigeria, insisting that war, which he described as a failure to dialogue, would never be a better solution to the problem than a round table discussion.\n\nHe, however, said that Igbo deserve right treatment in the comity of the Nigerian nation, who he said had a better advantage to remain in Nigeria because of their expansionist nature for the interest of generations yet unborn.\n\nHe noted that the agitation for Biafra by the young ones was occasioned by all the things done against the Igbo \u201cand you cannot beat a child and ask the child not to cry.\u201d\n\nFor Igbo to produce a Nigerian president come 2023, he said that it would be a collaborative effort between the Igbo and other entities that make up the country. Excerpt:\n\nAre the Southeast governors getting it right in the area of security?\n\nI don\u2019t know whether the Southeast governors are getting it right or not on the issue of security challenges, but I know that all office holders in Nigeria are suffering from the same problem. Most office holders abuse their offices, and the EFCC captures the abuses. If they do not behave the way they want, if the Federal Government is annoyed with you, they open your file and tell you, you are going to be finished in one day. Because of that most office holders are not very honest. Let me tell you one small thing. I read a statement said to be made by me that I laugh when I hear Fulani threaten war with Igbo people that, Fulani never fought the Igbo, that the Nigeria-Biafra war was fought between Biafra and Britain. But that is not exactly what I said. War damages both parties. It damages one perhaps more than the other and in the end they will look for talk. War is failure. War is a declaration of failure. When you fail to agree, you go to war and eventually after you finish the war you again begin to talk and make an agreement. The Fulani should forget it, fighting Igbo. They get nowhere fighting the Igbo. Igbo should forget antagonizing Fulani. We get nowhere antagonizing Fulani. We will mount a prayer, a prayer of all Igbo for the Igbo. The God, Chineke, which we serve, will not allow us to be ruined. Anybody who wants to ruin us will ruin himself. I\u2019m not talking about just Igbo, they are making it a religious affair, Christians and Muslims are worshipping the so-called God of Abraham, but the true Chineke is God in heaven, the only one God. In English they call Him God, in Arab they call Him Allah. In English they say He has an adopted Son, Jesus Christ. We don\u2019t know about that in our language. And the Arab do not know about that in their language. But there is only one God and all the world agree on one God. Don\u2019t misunderstand people who have all kinds of shrines. All the shrines they worship are hoping to lead them to one God, Chineke, the power that be, Chi-na-eke, which means God the creator. So, let Nigeria know that Nigeria is a gem of a country. Nigeria is a country more favoured than any other country, the way God favoured Israel more than all other people in the world.\n\nHow can this country Nigeria be secured. In the Southeast, they talk about Ebubeagu and there is Eastern Security Network (ESN). Specifically, how do you think Southeast could be secured?\n\nAll powers belong to God, Chineke. We shall pray to God to secure us not only us the South Easterners, but the Middle Belt as well, the Southwest, the Northeast and also God will secure the Northwest. This is what we want done and we must do. Only heaven loves us and that is the way it pleases the creator. Let nobody boast that he can do anything to any other. God has all the powers, he has all the powers. So, please as journalists, help save Nigeria, a gem of a country where we have everything. The weather is clement here, any grass that can grow anywhere in the world can grow in Nigeria, every animal too and human beings. Look at many gifts from many tribes, many talents from many tribes we have. This country will not die. I\u2019m Igbo. The present government of Nigeria is pulling my people down and pushing them out of Nigeria. But we refuse to go. So, we are going to call for prayers. We will devout one day, dedicate some hours for prayers. And after that prayer you will see the collapse of all the plans of the enemy, in Jesus\u2019 name.\n\nAnother thing that can cause problem now is Igbo not being allowed to rule Nigeria in 2023. What\u2019s your take?\n\nThe Almighty God in heaven has agreed that come 2023, a South Easterner will take over power as president of Nigeria. But we as a people must work for it. We must work hard for it. We must beg the North, Northeast, Northwest, Middle Belt. We must beg the Yoruba; we must beg the South-south. We must beg all groups in Nigeria, lobbing them, beg them and if it demands kneeling down, the knees will not get stuck on the land. We want one Nigeria. It is the best for the Igbo because we need large space for economic activities. Our people want large space for economic activities. I understand the people who are fighting for Biafra. You can\u2019t beat a child and tell the child not to cry. Yes, all the things done against the Igbo make fighting for Biafra justifiable. It\u2019s not only the Igbo that want to go out. Federal Government is pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria and we are saying no. We insist to remain. But the younger ones mostly don\u2019t know that we should look into long future not immediate because our great great grand children will enjoy Nigeria better than the present .",

          "text": "\u2022Canvasses true devolution of power\n\nBayo Akinloye\n\nA former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has said President Muhammadu Buhari must urgently take a number of steps that could immediately help to salvage the country from collapsing, otherwise, if the current situation continues to deteriorate, the imminent implosion would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with THISDAY, Campbell described the 1914 amalgamation of the Southern and Northern protectorates as an idea by the British colonial rulers for mere administrative convenience, which failed to factor the fault lines into proper account.\n\nListing some of the immediate steps to include addressing the police and military\u2019s age-old issue of human rights abuses, he added that the agitations in some quarters for secession could be also addressed if the federal government considered the logic in power devolution.\n\n\u201cRight away, it would be those steps that could be taken that would show Nigerian people that the government is moving to address the issues that bedevil the country. I would start with police reform and also, seeking to address the question of human rights abuses by both the police and the military,\u201d Campbell told THISDAY.\n\nThe former US ambassador and the Ralph Bunche senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations also recommended that the federal government should seriously consider a constitution that addresses the aspiration of the masses and endorsed by them.\n\nHe argued that the previous as well as the current constitutions used by the Nigerian government were imposed and did not address Nigeria\u2019s genuine political faultlines and aspirations, including its various ethnic nationalities, and urged those in power to pursue a course of rewriting the constitution that genuinely takes into consideration current issues and realities.\n\nCampbell explained: \u201cThe amalgamation of Nigeria by the British was done for their own administrative convenience without any consultation of Nigerians and without even very much thinking about what the consequences might be of putting together in a single unit 350 different ethnic groups that had little in common with each other.\n\n\u201cBut, I would suggest that that approach has continued. Nigeria\u2019s constitutions had been imposed first by the British, later by various military regimes, and was never submitted to the Nigerian people for a vote or for ratification.\u201d\n\nThe senior fellow at the CFR think-tank maintained that Nigeria\u2019s current constitution mimicked that of the U.S. but is generally relics of the British colonial rule and military regimes that had superintended Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe current constitution, in many respects, mimics that of the United States. In the immediate post-independence period, the country\u2019s constitution essentially mimicked that of the Westminster way of governance. Maybe these western models have shortcomings, when they are imposed on 350 different ethnic groups,\u201d Campbell observed.\n\nHe, however, warned that if the government and the political class remained indifferent to the current nationwide crises, Nigeria might end up in what he described as an \u201cunmitigated disaster.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWell, implosion of the country would be an unmitigated disaster. Whether that occurs or not is very largely up to Nigerians themselves and to their political leadership. The issue, the specific issue that I think is most dangerous at present is the deterioration of security across the country.\n\n\u201cJihadism in the North, conflict over water and land use in the Middle Belt, conflicts that often assume an ethnic and religious dimension, growing separatism sentiment in the South-East and even in Yorubaland the emergence of new institutions, which are not federal. I am talking in particular of the sort of quasi-security force that a number of the Yoruba governors have put together.\u201d\n\nInsisting on a constitution that reflects the aspirations of Nigerians and the current realities, Campbell noted that true federalism where the states are less dependent on the central government would serve the nation better.\n\n\u201cI think if there were genuine federalism in Nigeria, much of the agitation for ethnically based separatism would go away. What are the elements of genuine federalism? First of all, the entities that make up a federal republic need to be able to raise their own revenue and not be dependent on the central government for revenue, and now, almost all of the states are. I think only Lagos state, in fact, is able to raise much, though, not all of the revenue it needs,\u201d he further explained.\n\n\u2022See Interview on pages 17&18\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gboyega Akinsanmi\n\nThe activities of banditry, Boko Haram insurgency, farmers-herdsmen conflict, separatist agitation and organised violent groups, among others, cost the federation a whopping sum of $10.3 billion in 2020, the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) has disclosed.\n\nThe economic council gave the figure in a document presented during its sixth regular meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja penultimate Friday, detailing the socio-economic cost of insecurity across the federation.\n\nBuhari had constituted the council under the chairmanship of Prof Doyin Salami to replace the Economic Management Team (EMT), which Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo earlier set up to advise the National Economic Council.\n\nThe council, at its sixth regular meeting, dissected the country\u2019s economic environment with a strong indication that insecurity resulting from Boko Haram insurgency, political violence, resource-based violence, organised violence and farmers-herdsmen conflicts had crippled economic activities nationwide and contracted the country gross domestic product (GDP) by 2.6% in 2020.\n\nThe council cited the grievous consequences of ethno-religious conflicts mostly caused by suspicion and distrust among various ethnic groups and among the major religions in the country.\n\nExamples of such conflicts, as the council documented in its 33-slide presentation, are Boko Haram, conflicts in Southern Kaduna as well as farmers-herdsmen clashes in the Middle Belt, especially Benue State.\n\nThe council observed that there was a general consensus of a worsening of the security situation in Nigeria, which it said, included competition for power and ultimately resources, usually around the general election.\n\nResource based violence, according to the council in its presentation, comprised competition for economic opportunities driven by illegal mining in some states, kidnapping for ransom, Niger Delta militants and pirates and recent farmer-herder conflicts.\n\nThe council dissected the dynamics of violent farmers-herdsmen conflict, mainly among groups that peacefully co-existed previously, exacerbated by infiltration of foreigners on the one hand and climate change and environmental challenges on the other hand.\n\nCiting incontrovertible statistical evidence, the council claimed that nationwide insecurity had multidimensional implications, especially for economic and human development.\n\nIn terms of economic cost, the council disclosed that insecurity had cost Nigeria $10.3 billion or 2.6% of the GDP, which dropped $568.5 billion in 2014 to $375.75 billion in 2017 and rose to $448.12 billion in 2020.\n\nThe presidential council equally cited a study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimating that Nigeria lost $141.9 billion of production to security related violence between 2007 and 2019, a period of 16 years.\n\nThe council analysed the impact of human capital, which according to its slide presentation escalated the population of out-of-school children to over 13 million and significantly reduced life expectancy nationwide.\n\nWhile it claimed that extreme poverty in the conflict zones was accentuated by conflict, the council observed that unemployment rate, currently standing at 33.33%, had steadily increased since 2014, in line with worsening insecurity, thus\n\nadding to the population of persons that had fallen below the poverty line.\n\nAt large, the council said: \u201cConflicts and heightened insecurity reduce business confidence, manifested in declining foreign and domestic investment, deteriorating financial sector performance, higher fiscal cost and security spending.\u201d\n\nConsistent with PEAC\u2019s report, as shown in complementary data obtained from the NBS, the volume of the FDI inflow dropped from $2.28 billion in 2014 to $1.03 billion in 2020, accounting for 54.83%.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Okowa to Lawan: Elected Leaders Must Echo the Voices of Their People",
          "text": "\u2022Says govs shouldn\u2019t be vilified over call for restructuring\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nDelta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has condemned the statement made by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, following Southern Governors\u2019 call for restructuring, ban on open grazing and fiscal federalism, saying, \u201cIf your people are talking and you\u2019re an elected person but you shy away from giving further voice to their voices, then, you ought not be in the position that you occupy.\u201d\n\nOkowa, who spoke at an empowerment scheme by the minority leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, yesterday in Asaba, Delta State, also said it was utterly wrong to vilify the southern governors for heeding to the voices of the people and seeking to promote unity in the country.\n\nThe Senate President had after observing the Eid prayers at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Thursday, faulted the Southern Governors\u2019 resolutions, asking them to first start the restructuring in their respective states.\n\nBut Okowa noted that restructuring has been talked about for so long, with voices of PDP and APC endorsing it, saying that Nigerians must gather at a table to discuss for the good and future of the country.\n\nWhile agreeing that there might be different views and approaches to restructuring, the governor opined that when they sit at a table to dialogue, they would be able to agree best on what\u2019s good for Nigeria.\n\nHe warns that if the leadership continued to shy away and ignores the voices of the people, it would give room for further crisis.\n\nOkowa said, \u201dUnfortunately, I read in the papers that somebody (Lawan) said we ought not to talk about certain things being elected people. If your people are talking and you\u2019re an elected person but you shy away from giving further voice to their voices, then, you ought not be in the position that you occupy.\n\n\u201cSo, I must thank our people in the House of Representatives, who have responded to the speech made by their colleague in the National Assembly. All the things that the southern governors discussed, nothing is against the unity of this country.\n\n\u201dAs elected governors, we believe in the unity of our country, but it will help us also to advance the need for certain things to be done in order to give strength to that unity. That cannot be a reason for us to be vilified. So, I thought that it was time for other leaders across the country to thank the southern governors for uniting to give a voice to the conversations, because all those conversations coming at large level and it is given in the interest of larger majority of the people that we can have a truly united nation in which there\u2019s fairness and equity and trust amongst our people and the leadership.\u201d\n\nOkowa said an attempt must be made to take some actions at the national level to put a stop to open grazing and therefore advised the federal government to spend part of the national resource to help to start new pilot schemes for ranching and grazing reserves.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dToday, in the developing world things are changing very fast and I think we are ready to begin to look futuristically, we may not be able to get ourselves out of where we are at the moment. There are several grazing reserves that have been abandoned, why were they abandoned?\n\n\u201cWe have asked that the federal government let us spend part of the national resource to help to start new pilot schemes for which those of us in the south do support that some federal resource be spent to start up some of these ranching, grazing reserves or whatever you call it, in order to slow down and eventually put a stop in years to come.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a wrong decision; it\u2019s in the best interest of our nation and our people. I urge that all leaders in the country, stakeholders to log into the good salvations that have been put forth by southern governors and it\u2019s time to embrace it as a people. It is in the interest of the country, otherwise,we will get to a stage when there will be food insecurity in the land.\u201d\n\nOn the upcoming gubernatorial election in Delta State, the governor chided politicians and citizens jumping the ship due to promises made to them in the scramble for who will replace him as governor.\n\n\u201dWe are politicians and politics will have to be played. I can see that a lot of things are going on in our dear state, especially, as the scramble for who will replace Dr. Okowa comes. Unfortunately, some were not even patient right from the very first three months that we came into office for our second tenure, they have started their campaign. That ought not to be. Beyond all these, I want to charge our leaders and our people to be cautious, because politics, if you don\u2019t play it rightly, you can throw your people into quietness.\n\n\u201dWhoever is coming to rule over this state by the special grace of God must be somebody, who is ready to ensure that there is fairness, justice and equity in everything. We want somebody, who will come to Asaba and see Asaba as his own and not somebody who will come in here and feel that Asaba as headquarters is misplaced.\n\n\u201cWe must make the people happy and together, because collectively when we speak as one people and endorse somebody that has a life line, somebody who will be fair to all Deltans, then, we can be happy and go to sleep. I will not have a governor that will put a ban on Anioma people,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gboyega Akinsanmi\n\nThe British Museum, the world\u2019s first national public museum, currently holds 700 pieces of the Benin Bronzes collection, more than any other museum and other institutions globally, a former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. John Campbell has said.\n\nCampbell, however, acknowledged that the authorities of the British Museum had agreed \u201cto return the Benin Bronzes collection once the Edo Museum of West African Art, currently under construction in Benin City is completed.\u201d\n\nHe gave this figure in a blog post titled \u201cGermany to Return Some African Art to Nigeria\u201d published on the website of Council for Foreign Relations (CFR), a US non-profit think-tank specialising in international affairs on Wednesday.\n\nMore than a century after British soldiers looted a collection of priceless artifacts from the Kingdom of Benin, some of the Benin bronzes are heading back to Nigeria \u2013 with strings attached.\n\nConsequently, more than 1,000 of the bronzes are held at museums across Europe, with the most valuable collection at the British Museum in London despite that the federal government had canvassed the return of the artifacts since the country gained independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) had struck a deal to return some of the most iconic pieces in the historic collection on a temporary basis to form an exhibition at the new Benin Royal Museum in Edo State within three years.\n\nBut in his blog post, Campbell wrote that the German Minister of Culture, Monika Gr\u00fctters had announced plan to return hundreds of art objects to Nigeria.\n\nCampbell, currently Ralph Bunche Senior fellow for Africa Policy Studies said the origin of the artifacts \u201cis the Benin Royal Palace\u2014located in Benin City situated in Southern Nigeria\u2014looted and destroyed by the British in 1897.\n\n\u201cThe Germans, however, were not in Edo and, presumably, the objects from there were looted objects purchased on the international art market and then donated to German museums.\n\n\u201cThe German decision has raised pressure on London\u2019s British Museum\u2014which holds seven hundred pieces of the Benin Bronzes collection, more than any other museum\u2014and other institutions to lend or return bronzes to Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, according to the former ambassador, as few as 50 pieces of the iconic artifacts remain in Nigeria at present after the looting of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897.\n\nHe said: \u201cCalls for the return of art acquired by Western countries during the colonial period is an old song. Some countries, especially where national identity is weak, see the return of art as a dimension of nation-building.\u201d\n\nSince the nineteenth century, the former US envoy noted that the Greeks had agitated for the British return of the Parthenon sculptures (the \u201cElgin Marbles\u201d).\n\nHe added that the Greek perspective \u201ctakes for granted that the art produced in a particular locale uniquely belongs to the people who live there now, hence the importance of its physical repatriation.\n\n\u201cAnother perspective is that art belongs to humanity as a whole. What matters in that case is the art\u2019s accessibility to all who wish to see and study it and its conservation and security, not its physical location.\n\n\u201cAn issue with respect to the return of African art to Africa has been the lack of places where it could be exhibited, stored securely, and curated. That appears to be changing. The Edo Museum is designed to be a world-class facility.\u201d\n\nHowever, Campbell observed that the museum was located in \u201ca poor, increasingly unstable country. Where sustainable funding will come from or how security of the art can be maintained is unclear.\n\n\u201cThe sponsors of the Edo Museum are looking toward rotating exhibits of artwork to be borrowed from European and American collections and then returned.\n\n\u201cSuch an approach might satisfy those who see the art as a badge of their ethnic or national identity and those who see the art as belonging to all of humanity.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A documentary has spotlighted the harsh realities of underpayment, shortchanging, and sexual harassment models deal with in Nigeria\u2019s fashion industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeveloped by Nxtgen, the documentary featured agents, ex-beauty queens, agency owners, and designers who gave insight into how the industry works.\n\nQueen Onyemaechi, CEO of Anani Models, said there is a misconception about the profession where models are likened to sex workers.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where my older sister said, \u2018you\u2019re going into prostitution. Why not go to school, learn a skill. She was trying to change my mind but I knew what I was going for. I started modeling and it changed my life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarisson Akadidi of H&M Modeling said: \u201cWe have situations where agents want to pimp models for sex, mainly females. We have where agents who are supposed to act in the interest of the models develop lust.\n\n\u201cLot of models are from very poor homes. They need finance at a level you can\u2019t even imagine; like anything is survival for them. You tell them certain things over and over again and they trust you and your judgment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenting on the issue of body shaming and inappropriate advances, Ugochi Ihezue, a female model, narrated how an agent sought a hotel meet-up after rejecting her in the casting process for a show.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe modeling industry is a superficial industry if I\u2019m using the right word. You get your body criticized. You hear things like, \u2018your thighs are too big, your bum is too big, your bum is too small. Your boobs are too big\u2019.\n\n\u201cPeople look at you and there\u2019s always something to fix on your body. I had a couple of castings I went for and I wasn\u2019t really picked but the manager was calling me and making advances. \u2018Can you meet me up in a hotel?\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him I wasn\u2019t picked and he insisted, saying he was going to do something about it. I didn\u2019t go because there was no point to it if what he wanted to do was not done at the casting location.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortchanging of models, agency corruption and \u2018lack of structure\u2019\n\nBayo Haastrup, an industry veteran, said a lack of structure in the fashion scene has allowed room for many anomalies, such as shortchanging of models.\n\n\u201cThe models are the main show. They\u2019re the ones that do everything happening in the fashion business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe showcase the clothes. They bring out the portrait; the image of how the designer wants the apparel to be worn on stage. They do many things and, in the end, you pay the artists who come to sing for 30 minutes N2 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the model who has been on rehearsals for two, three weeks prior; who has done so much; who is wearing like maybe four or ten designers \u2014 you pay them N150,000. And you have the sponsorship of N150 million for a show.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. There is no structure in the industry in Nigeria. So many agencies are not doing the right thing, they don\u2019t have the interest of the models at heart.\u201d\n\nIhezue added that brands request unpaid partnerships with models in the guise of giving them exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople want you to do jobs free, they don\u2019t want to pay for your services, and even when you get paid, you get underpaid.\n\n\u201cFashion designers and people that are in charge are booking these models at cheap stakes. Nobody wants to spend extra money on a face that is not known.\n\n\u201cBeing Nigeria, people only appreciate faces that they know. And when they actually now get models to do these jobs for them, they pay them peanuts \u2014 50k, 30k. They tell you 10k for transport.\n\n\u201cYou hear things like [they\u2019re giving you] exposure. The only place that is is a bit better is the runway show. Even at that, prices increased and they suddenly dropped for like two years in a row.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Airtel Africa\u2019s profits grow by 1.8% as it posts $415 million net profit for FY 2021",
          "text": "Airtel Africa, the holding company for Bharti Airtel\u2019s operations in Africa, has released its financial report for the year ended March 31, 2021. One of the report highlights is that the company\u2019s revenues are up by 14.2% to $3.8 billion.\n\nOn the back of this revenue, Airtel Africa also posted net profits of $415 million, a slight growth of 1.8% from the previous year where it made $408 million in profits after tax.\n\nDespite the flat profit growth, it is still an impressive result for the business in a year where Covid-19 has stalled economic growth across Africa. Additionally, in Nigeria, the company\u2019s biggest market, a ban on SIM card registration stifled growth.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s CEO, Raghunath Mandava, said in a statement, \u201cIn these challenging times, I want to say a huge thank you to all our employees, our business partners, and governments and regulators who have supported us, and in turn facilitated our continued support to the economies and communities we serve.\n\nOur performance has been strong, \u201cwith reported growth of 13.6% in underlying revenue and 18.3% in underlying EBITDA, and constant currency growth of 19.4% and 25.2%, respectively. Contributions to this growth came across all regions, with particular improvement in Francophone Africa, and across all our major services, with mobile money, data and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nA look at the company\u2019s significant services shows that voice revenue continues to lead the way, bringing in more than half its revenue. Yet, that does not tell the whole story, as the growth in voice revenue has slowed over the last few years.\n\nData and mobile money revenue are the real stars of the show. Data contributed 35% to the revenue as it continues to show promise as Airtel deepens its investment in internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cData usage per customer reached 2.6 GB per customer (from 1.8 GB per customer) led by an increase in smartphone penetration and expansion of our home broadband and enterprise customers. This helped us grow data revenue 31.2% in constant currency. Growing penetration and usage of 3G and 4G data customers helped us grow data ARPU 8.2%. 4G data usage more than doubled in the year, contributing 62.2% of total data usage on the network in Q4\u201921.\u201d\n\nAirtel Money is also seeing significant growth, adding $401 million to revenue compared to the $311 million it added last year. According to Airtel, \u201cWe have increased the number of mobile money agents by 30.7%, kiosks by 68.8% and mobile money branches by 95%. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, both through partnerships with leading financial institutions and through expansion of our merchant ecosystem, have further strengthened our mobile money propositions.\u201d\n\nAnother important update from the report is a leadership change at Airtel Africa as Mandava will retire from his post and as a director on 30 September. Olusegun Ogunsanya will take over as the new managing director and CEO.",

          "title": "A startup bill for Nigeria is being discussed between founders, investors and government reps",
          "text": "One landmark acquisition, several funding rounds and meaningful expansions have drawn attention to Nigeria\u2019s potential to become an enabling environment for businesses. Nigerian tech startups are raising larger seed rounds and pursuing unique global ambitions than at any other time in the last decade.\n\nBut in the last 18 months, major regulatory events that ended motorcycle-hailing and suspended cryptocurrency transactions through banks have been interpreted as setbacks to innovation.\n\nOne problem with these types of regulations is how sudden they are, seemingly without forewarning from the hammer bearers. They raise an unambiguous question: can startups really flourish in Nigeria?\n\nTo dispel such fears and sustain optimism about doing business in Nigeria, startup leaders are fishing for solutions with the cooperation of government officials. One urgent offer on the table is a Nigeria startup bill.\n\nMaking laws work\n\nLast weekend, Kola Aina*, founding partner of Ventures Platform, talked about a plan to \u201cco-create an executive bill that will support the growth of our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe event was a virtual ecosystem townhall with the theme Making laws work for startups in Nigeria.\n\nAina was joined by Adaeze Sokan, Ventures Platform\u2019s director of strategy and policy; Iyin Aboyeji*, general partner of Future Africa; and Adia Sowho, acting CEO of Thrive Agric.\n\nAlso on the call were Oswald Guobadia, senior special assistant to the Nigerian president on digital transformation; Ife Adebayo, special assistant to the vice president on innovation and entrepreneurship; and Jon Stever, managing director of Innovation for Policy Foundation (i4Policy), a consultancy.\n\n\u201cMany of us have tried to do business with certain countries and institutions, and many of them often cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason they can\u2019t interact with us,\u201d Sowho said, explaining the need for a startup act.\n\nApart from disruptive regulation, she listed weak infrastructure and difficulty accessing capital among the problems facing Nigerian startups.\n\nA startup act could be a first step in setting up a structure around these problems. Tunisia (in 2018) and Senegal (in 2019) passed startup laws under similar rationales. Startup acts are becoming recognised as a tool for policy innovation in Africa.\n\nGlobal standard, local context\n\nSo what should a Nigerian startup act look like? Firstly, it must reflect the country\u2019s present reality.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is overborrow from the context of other countries,\u201d Sowho said.\n\n\u201cWe need the minutiae of this bill to be from our experience and understanding of this country of ours that is just very difficult to compare to other places.\u201d\n\nThat said, Nigerian startups operate within a global business environment. For one, the majority of venture capital investment in the sector comes from foreign inflows. This binds startups to international standards on operations, ethics and ambition.\n\nAt the very least, Nigerian startups should have enabling business conditions similar to those being designed in Senegal and Tunisia, but also in Ghana (which passed Africa\u2019s first small business act in 1981), South Africa, Kenya\u2026 and with some effort, the United States.\n\nJon Iver of i4Policy making a presentation about small business and startup Acts in Africa\n\ni4Policy helped co-create Senegal\u2019s startup act two years ago. At the townhall, Stever showed a timeline of small business and startup acts in Africa; Nigeria was not present.\n\nHe observed that startup acts are not made through regular lawmaking processes but typically result from entrepreneurs taking the initiative themselves.\n\nBut something else is noteworthy: \u201cIn the cases where this has been really successful, there has always been a government champion that wants to listen to startups,\u201d Stever said.\n\nIt would then seem a good omen for Nigeria\u2019s startup bill plans that this townhall had two government advisors, who work at the intersection of digitization and entrepreneurship, in attendance.\n\nGuobadia called attention to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s new year address, about a need for \u201can enabling environment to turn [young people\u2019s] passions into ideas that can be supported, groomed and scaled.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s agencies have made some moves in this regard.\n\nIn 2018, the Office of ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIIE) was involved in tech policy hackathons in Lagos and Abuja to develop frameworks for entrepreneurship and innovation. One goal of the Ministry of Digital Economy\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2030 strategy document is \u201c[supporting] digital entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions for local and global challenges.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment announced that a draft National Policy on Startups was on the government\u2019s agenda. Otunba Niyi Adebayo, the minister, has made a point of attending startup-related events, whether about attracting investment or engaging startups on what they are building.\n\nCurrently in a virtual meeting with The Bulb Africa Partnership who are presenting a mobile money and peer-to-peer payment/market place and showing interest in setting up a tech hub/campus to support tech startups and train youth who are interested in pic.twitter.com/yqaxf9ReGY \u2014 Otunba Niyi Adebayo (@NiyiAdebayo_) January 7, 2021\n\nIs this another false start?\n\nIt is great to have ecosystem players take the startup bill bull by the horns. But there were reminders \u2013 from Mark Essien, Hotels.ng CEO, and Lexi Novitske, a venture capitalist \u2013 that we have sort of been here before.\n\nGuobadia agreed, but said the presidency has spent time assessing what it would take to do better this time. They have identified a process problem, which will be solved by a \u201cbig tent\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cWe are building a fabric to knit all [relevant] agencies into this initiative. We took the effort to avoid having competing conversations,\u201d Guobadia said.\n\nAina\u2019s presentation indicated that the Nigerian presidency intends to introduce a draft legislation as early as August. It will be based on a draft startup law by ecosystem leaders with input from federal and state stakeholders from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nThe plan for a Nigeria startup bill\n\nTimelines could shift but parties involved in this bill have been in conversations for about two months, Aina said.\n\n\u201cI am very aware that there is already an ongoing consultation with the Lagos state government,\u201d he said, mentioning that a presidential advisory group on the proposed bill has been having meetings.\n\nKola Aina is one of the members of the Nigeria startup ecosystem leading the startup bill efforts\n\nAboyeji said the plans are still evolving at the moment but he is optimistic that this time could be different.\n\n\u201cI think versus other times, we have grown to such a size and scale that is easy to see what the potential benefits of fixing this issue could be.\u201d\n\nHe and Sowho emphasised that a Nigerian startup bill that works will not be achieved without startups participating in the process. \u201cThis will require sweat from all of us and we should be ready to put the work in,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nThe group has set the ball rolling and welcomes interested people to volunteer for the effort by sending an email to partners@venturesplatform.com, or provide feedback through this form.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: TechCabal hosted this event and has a representative on the Advisory Board for the startup bill project. *Through their firms, Kola Aina and Iyin Aboyeji are investors in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "text": "Source: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nIn April, TECNO launched the Spark 7 series, a new addition to the brand\u2019s Spark line-up, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIn TECNO\u2019s usual way, the Spark 7 comes with a lot of impressive upgrades when compared to its predecessors under the flagship. For the purpose of this article, we will be focusing on the more popular of the series, the Spark 7P.\n\nOut of the box, the Spark 7P comes in four colour variations \u2013 the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations \u2013 which allows for vivaciously interesting choices to pick from when in the market to buy the Spark 7P device.\n\nSCREEN FOR MAXIMUM VIEW\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nThe Spark 7P\u2019s screen is impressively massive and elegant. The device comes with a bigger and better 6.8-inch edge-to-edge display and a screen resolution of 720*1600 HD, bringing to your fingertips an immersive cinematic experience. Without a doubt, movie lovers, gamers and even vloggers will enjoy unfettered fun in whatever form they choose.\n\nTOP-NOTCH PICTURE QUALITY\n\nSpark 7P\u2019s 8MP selfie camera appears in a notch at the top of the device, with 2 LED flash positioned on both sides of the camera. At the back is the 16MP dual camera, with a depth sensor second module that makes the device\u2019s Video Bokeh feature possible. The camera can record 240fps slow-motion videos. Users can also enjoy close-up photography with a 4cm macro photography mode that allows to capture small and minute details. Additionally, the device includes AI HDR technology to increase dynamic range beyond what is captured by the camera\u2019s sensors, allowing users to take photos with a higher dynamic range, fewer noise and clearer details.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nSummarily, with the Spark 7P\u2019s newly upgraded algorithm AI Camera 3.0 and AI scene detection, photos taken by the device will be much more impressive and attractive under any scenario.\n\nPRIVACY FOR A HIGH PERFORMING MACHINE\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nOne special feature that comes with the Spark 7P is the Peak proof which lets you leave a portion of your screen dark so you can keep personal information out of the glare of people when you use your phone in public places.\n\nThe Spark 7P also packs a punch with a powerful 5,000 mAh battery, so that consumers can run powerful applications and multiple tabs without the need to constantly recharge. The high-performance device that runs on HIOS 7.5 allows for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting the mobile device. The operating system is also bundled with utility applications that allow users to free up memory, freeze applications and limit data accessibility to applications. With the device\u2019s dark mode, the phone also gives users more battery time and decreased blue light emission, reducing eye strain.\n\nAnother highlight of the Spark 7P is its 90Hz refreshing speed. With the blazing-fast 90Hz refresh rate, the animation on the device doesn\u2019t have to look like a flip book, but one smooth, snappy, and refreshing experience.\n\nIn terms of storage capacity, the Spark 7P is available in sizeable 4GB ROM+ 64GB RAM and 4GB+128GB versions and is available at a sweet price range of 60,900 Naira and 68,800 Naira respectively.\n\nTECNO\u2019s Spark series targets trendy students, but has quickly risen to become popular among young working professionals and middle-aged folks.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick.

          "text": "On Saturday, May 8, 2021, the first dedicated Nigerian blockchain hub, Convexity Blockchain Hub (CBHUB), was inaugurated in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Stakeholders in the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN).\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the hub, Adedeji Owonibi, CBHUB Founder, says the aim is to create a hub ecosystem where people can come and just focus in a space dedicated to blockchain technology, a space to innovate and create solutions within Nigeria using blockchain.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, the hub will offer blockchain solutions that have absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian blockchain technology ecosystem is an arena relatively unknown to a lot of Nigerians. It is often confused with its more well-known subset, cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are popular uses of blockchain, it can also be used for other things, such as the solutions CBHUB would provide.\n\nThese solutions range from its Convexity Humanitarian Aid Distribution Solution (Chats), which is geared towards creating transparency in the aid distribution space to BitCert, one of its projects aimed at reducing certificate counterfeiting in schools.\n\nAs at launch time, CBHUB has partners in Lagos and also supports communities in Northern Nigeria, teaching classes in the local Hausa language.\n\nThis is a far cry from 2018 when Paxful, a leading Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency exchange, reported that it would be launching a blockchain incubator hub. This hub was to be headed by Chimezie Chuta, the Founder of Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG).\n\nHowever, Chuta says that after reviewing the information provided, the company wasn\u2019t convinced of the initiative\u2019s viability as a self-sustaining business. Ultimately, Paxful decided to pull the plug.\n\nFirst cryptocurrency forensics lab in Africa\n\nThe first African crypto forensics lab was also launched at the event on Saturday. The lab boasts world-class facilities and is the result of a partnership with Chainalysis, a global leader in the cryptocurrency forensics sphere.\n\nA Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime Report cites South Africa-based company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), as the biggest crypto investment scam of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, illicit cryptocurrency trading accounted for just 2% of Africa\u2019s $16 billion trading volume from July 2019 to June 2020, with scams accounting for 55% of this low level of illicit activity.\n\nWhile Africa has the lowest numbers for illicit cryptocurrency trading globally, the launch of CBHUB\u2019s crypto forensics lab is yet another plus in the fight against crypto scams like MTI.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, there are ways to attach identities to blockchain users despite the relative anonymity/pseudonymity of the technology.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) can be aggregated from crypto exchanges, laptops, and phones through which people interact with the blockchain technology.\n\nThe hub will provide essential tools for crypto-crime investigators and security agencies constantly faced with numerous challenges while investigating crypto-based crimes and illicit money transaction activities.\n\nAll that the investigators need is to reskill and upskill on how to use these tools, says Chuta.\n\nConvexity, truly the first?\n\nWhile CBHUB is undoubtedly Nigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub, it is not the first blockchain hub to be established in the country. In 2015, Blockchain Tech Hub was founded by Samuel Benedict Ogbonnaya.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn profile, it \u201cwas established with the aim of pioneering Blockchain innovation in Africa by training and producing the best qualified Blockchain developers in Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Tech Hub is no longer in operation; the link to its advertised website returns a \u201cThis site can\u2019t be reached\u201d page. Attempts to reach Ogbonnaya were futile as his LinkedIn and Twitter accounts last recorded activity in 2019.\n\nNigeria and blockchain\n\nIn October 2020, NITDA announced that it had started developing a blueprint and strategy document for the \u201cNational Adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIt followed this announcement with the release of the Draft National Blockchain Adoption Strategy. The document outlines the roadmap and strategies for adopting blockchain technology by the government in its digital transformation agenda.\n\nIt also highlights the strategic objectives and initiatives that the government will actively pursue through designated Ministries, Departments, & Agencies (MDAs) during the stipulated period.\n\nWhile the Federal Government of Nigeria has so far been silent on its steps going forward, the launch of the CBHUB portends a step in the right direction in Nigeria\u2019s blockchain adoption journey, especially regarding education and skilling up.\n\nThis, of course, must be reviewed in the light of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest crypto order which threw Nigerian crypto traders into a panic in February 2021.\n\nCBN ordered banks to close the accounts of persons or entities transacting cryptocurrency or operating a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt this stage, with its seemingly conflicting policies, two questions come to mind: Should Nigerian blockchain enthusiasts be cautiously optimistic? Would the Nigerian government take any more positive steps regarding blockchain soon?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions in the coming days should reveal more on this.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

There is a need to embark on more of the exercise by ensuring compliance in other areas for people to be aware of the need to comply,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt is essential to know that there is an enforcement going on along with this environmental exercise. Anybody that is caught not doing their bit will be persecuted. We will continue to sensitize residents on the need not to patronize unregistered and illegal waste collectors.\n\n\u201cWe are using this opportunity to reemphasize again that the Saturday sanitation exercise is continuous. There is no restriction of movement but there is enforcement for those who will not keep their surroundings clean,\u201d he added.\n\nThe environmental health officers visited Boundary Road, all adjourning streets up to Ihama as well aa Sakponba Road and all adjourning streets up to 2nd East circular.\n\nOther areas visited include: Five Junction through TV Road, adjourning streets up to Isekhere, Lagos street axis, adjourning streets up to Iwehen and Wire road, Sapele road axis, among others.\n\n...",

Nyesom Wike of Rivers, on Saturday said that the decision of the Southern Governors on open grazing and other issues remain irrevocable and must be respected.\n\nNAN reports that the Forum of Southern Governors in one voice, recently announced a ban on open grazing in all the 17 Southern states.\n\nWike stated this during a grand reception held in his honour by Ogoni nationality in Bori, headquarters of Khana Local Government Area.\n\nHe said those opposed to resolutions taken by Southern governors in Asaba, Delta State, should realise that no section of the country is inferior to others.\n\nWike declared that he has taken further steps to fulfill the resolutions reached by Southern Governors in Asaba.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a position and no going back.

          "text": "The governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, as well as other Southern governors, have maintained their stance on open grazing ban, noting that their decision is final.\n\nThe 17 Southern governors had after their meeting in Asaba, Delta State on Tuesday, issued a communique banning open grazing in the region, even as they asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately convene a national dialogue with a view of restructuring the country.\n\nHowever, their resolution attracted backlash from certain individuals in the North, notably Borno South Senator, Ali Ndume and Professor Usman Yusuf, former Executive Secretary of National Health Insurance Scheme, who argued that the ban could not stand, as the herders were not consulted.\n\nBut reaffirming his government\u2019s stand at the weekend, Ikpeazu reiterated his commitment to enforcing the ban on open grazing of cattle in Abia.\n\nThe governor who spoke during a zoom meeting with newsmen of Abia extraction under the aegis of Abia Media Forum, said that a bill was already in place to enforce the ban and to check the activities of criminal elements disguising as nomads.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the point of making sure that we enforce and implement it and even in doing that I must also share what I see as a challenge to the enforcement of that law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe law is in place and we are taking steps to enforce it. It has become imperative that we enforce that law strictly because we just noticed that we have big time trouble in our hands.\n\n\u201cWe have those that we refer to as criminal herdsmen; they are different from the ordinary herdsmen that we have been living with all these years. We now have in our mist bandits that have infiltrated from the rest of West Africa and other parts of Africa and their assignment is to come here rape, kill and kidnap people for money.\n\n\u201cIt is now very imperative that we enforce that law,\u2019\u2019 he added\n\nSimilarly, Rivers State governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, on Saturday, maintained that the ban will stay, as according to him, Southerners are not second class citizens of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at a civic reception organised in his honour by the Ogoni Ethnic Nationality of Rivers State in Bori, headquarters of Khana Local Government Area on Saturday, the state governor, Wike said the decision ban open grazing was cast in stone, even as he said he is not afraid of anybody.\n\n\u201cLook, I have been in government, I am in opposition, nobody can cow me. Magnus (Abe), they know, their government cannot cow me. I will say what I will say and I will do what is right for my people. Nobody will anything to me. I will die the day God says it is my day. Nobody can take my life when it is not time for me to die. So, let nobody be afraid,\u201d Wike said.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to say, all those who are saying why should Southern Governors ban grazing \u2013 I have taken further steps to fulfill what the Southern Governors said in Asaba. If anybody wants to die, go and die and hang yourself on electric pole.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a position and we are not going back. Enough is enough; we are not second class of citizens of this country. We also own this country and we must partake in what is happening in this country.\u201d\n\nAlso, Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, while addressing party members in Asaba at the weekend, maintained that the ban was sacrosanct, even as he said their call for devolution of powers was most in order.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard a lot about the southern governors meeting. We thank God for that meeting. We thank God for bringing us together. The things that we said aren\u2019t new. We\u2019re only re-echoing what our people have been agitating for,\u201d Okowa said.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately I read that somebody said we ought not to talk about certain things as elected people. If the voice of your people is out always and as an elected person you shy away from giving further voice to their voices, then you ought not to be in the position you occupy.\n\n\u201cSo, I thank our people in the House of Reps who have responded to the speech made by their colleagues,\u201d he enthused.\n\nOkowa argued that there was no reason for any region or individual to be afraid of the governors\u2019 stance as a non-issue relating to dismembering the country was discussed at the forum.\n\n\u201cAs I did say, there\u2019s none of the things we\u2019ve discussed that\u2019s against the unity of this country. We believe in the unity of our country as elected leaders. But we also went ahead to advance for some things that must be done to give strength to the unity.\n\n\u201cWe talked about restructuring which has been on the table for too long. Both the voices of the PDP and the APC have been on restructuring.\n\n\u201cAnd restructuring is all-inclusive and all-encompassing. We all have different views on it. But when we all sit at a round table, we\u2019ll agree on what\u2019s best for us all.\n\n\u201cThe conversations have started and our people are talking and when we do not give backing to their voices, then we\u2019re giving room for further crisis.\n\n\u201cOther leaders should thank the southern governors for giving further voices to the conversation which can bring about a country with fairness, equity and trust among the people,\u201d he concluded.",

That a state institution can issue such is a measure of the administration\u2019s commitment to accountability, equality and justice.\n\n\u201cTo set the records straight, the person declared wanted by the ICPC is not an in-law to President Buhari. While at some point in time, the said fugitive from justice had been linked to a family member in marriage; that relationship has ended some years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unfortunate to bring the Presidents family into this case. It is in our view an attempt to generate views and sell copies of sensational reporting.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s position at all times is that the law be allowed to take its course. As is well known of him, President Muhammadu Buhari will not provide any cover for crime, no matter who is involved.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC had said Kumo is wanted alongside Tarry Rufus and Bola Ogunsola over alleged misappropriation and dispersion of national housing fund.\n\nThe notice, published on the commission\u2019s website was signed by the ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Azuka Ogugua.\n\nIt reads, \u201cThe persons whose pictures appear above, Mr Tarry Rufus, Mr Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of $65m.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters, Abuja, any of the ICPC state offices or the nearest police station.\u201d\n\nKumo\u2019s tenure at FMBN was characterised by allegations of corruption.\n\nIt was alleged that the fleeing former boss of FMBN and three others paid themselves outrageous severance packages at the end of their tenure in October 2014.\n\nLast month, the senate committee on public accounts summoned Kumo to explain the alleged irregular award of N3 billion contract when he was still at the bank.",

We have capacity to do 60million cards per annual.

Others are Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi state.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement made public by the head, Corporate Communications, Kaduna Electric, Abdulazeez Abdullahi.\n\nIt reads in part: \u201cThe Management of Kaduna Electric regrets to inform its customers in Kaduna State that the service interruption currently being experienced in the state is as a result of the industrial action embarked upon by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC).\n\n\u201cIn compliance with the NLC directive, the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN has knocked off all our 33KV lines in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we are appealing to all communities, security agencies and vigilante groups to be vigilant so that men of the underworld will not cash in on the situation to vandalise power supply installations.

When I shot down the proposal, he then gave me five days to vacate our home, threatening to kill me or the baby.\u201d\n\nShe was left to fend for the triplets as well as their 11-year old child, Ruvimbo, on her own. Maposa however, received an assistance from Zimbabwe\u2019s Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Senator Monica Mutsvangwa when she attended the ZANU PF Women\u2019s League inter-district meeting in Marange this Saturday May 15.\n\nShe said; \u201cAfter having faced a lot of challenges since i gave birth to my triplets, I am happy that I got help from Mai Mutsvangwa.

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has urged the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, to \u201cuse their good offices to urgently probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N4.1 billion of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated, diverted or stolen, as documented in the 2016 audited report by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cthese allegations are not part of the disclosure by the Auditor-General in other audited reports that N4.4 billion of National Assembly money is missing, misappropriated, diverted or stolen.\u201d\n\nThis is contained in a letter dated May 15, 2021, and signed by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nAccording to the organisation, \u201cAs part of its legislative and oversight functions, the National Assembly has a key role to play in the fight against corruption in the country. But little can be achieved by the legislative body in the anti-corruption fight if the leadership and members do not first confront the spectre of alleged corruption and mismanagement within their ranks.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged Lawan and Gbajabiamila \u201cto identify the lawmakers and staff members suspected to be involved, and hand them over to appropriate anti-corruption agencies to face prosecution, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to ensure full recovery of any missing public funds.\u201d\n\nThe letter continued, \u201cEnsuring the effective investigation of these fresh allegations, and full recovery of any missing public funds would strengthen the country\u2019s accountability framework, and show that the National Assembly can discharge its constitutional responsibility of amplifying the voices of Nigerians. It will also show that the body is acting in the best interest of the people.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that allegations of corruption continue to undermine economic development, violate social justice, and destroy trust in economic, social, and political institutions. Nigerians bear the heavy economic and social costs of corruption. The National Assembly, therefore, has a responsibility to curb it.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2016, N4,144,706,602.68 of National Assembly money is missing, diverted or stolen. The National Assembly paid some contractors N417,312,538.79 without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount in question from the contractors.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly reportedly spent N625,000,000.00 through its Constitution Review Committee between March and June 2016 but without any document. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount from the Committee and furnish evidence of recovery for verification.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly spent N66,713,355.08 as \u2018personnel cost\u2019 but \u2018the payees in the Cashbook did not correspond with those in the Bank Statement\u2019. The Auditor-General wants \u2018the irregular expenditure recovered from the officer who approved the payments.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly paid N116,162,522.60 to some contractors between April and June 2016 without any document. The National Assembly deducted N56,985,568.55 from various contract payments in respect of Withholding Tax and Value Added Tax but without any evidence of remittance.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly paid N126,264,320.00 as cash advances to 11 staff members between March and December 2016 to procure goods and services but failed to remit the money.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly paid N747,286,680.00 as personal advances to staff members between February and December 2016 for various procurements and services but failed to retire the money. The Senate also deducted N118,625,057.48 as Withholding and Value Added Taxes but failed to show any evidence of remittance to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also spent N109,007,179.73 from the Capital Expenditure vote but without any document.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives reportedly deducted N821,564,296.48 from staff salaries but failed to remit the money to tax authorities. The House also paid N254,059,513.70 as advances to staff members to procure goods and services between January and December 2016 but failed to retire the money.\n\n\u201cThe National Institute for Legislative Studies reportedly spent N375,867,000.00 to buy 11 motor vehicles in April 2016. But the Institute also paid the same contractor N36,610,000.00 in September 2016 under the same contract without approval.\n\n\u201cThe Institute also reportedly paid N10,927,768.80 to 7 members of staff who were redeployed from the National Assembly to provide specialized services but without details about the staff paid, and without any justification.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly Service Commission reportedly approved N109,995,400.00 to train some officers in Dubai, United Arab Emirates but spent N127,629,600.00 as Estacode Allowances to participants, and fees for two consultants engaged for the training. The Commission also spent N9,975,000.00 as course fees for 34 officers but it also paid a consultant N4,987,500.00 for the same course fees.\n\n\u201cThe Legislative Aides Section earned N12,274,587.77 as interests on Bank accounts in a commercial bank between January and December 2016 but failed to remit the money to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if you would indicate the measures being taken to address the allegations and to implement the proposed recommendations, within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.\n\n\u201cIf we have not heard from you by then as to the steps being taken in this direction, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel the leadership of the National Assembly to implement these recommendations in the public interest, and to promote transparency and accountability in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly can only effectively perform its anti-corruption role if it can demonstrate exemplary leadership to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving the legislative body.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the Auditor-General in 2015, 2017 and 2018 reports documented that N4.4 billion of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated, diverted or stolen.\n\n\u201cAddressing the allegations would improve public confidence and trust in the ability of the National Assembly to exercise its constitutional and oversight responsibilities, and to adhere to the highest standards of integrity.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Oduduwa Agitators: No Police Action Can Stop Us \u2013 South West Groups",
          "text": "Agitators for the cre\u00adation of the Yoru\u00adba nation have dismissed police decision to monitor and investigate their activities, especially in Lagos State.\n\nChief Deji Osinbogun, a leader of the Yoruba World Assembly (YWA), maintained that since all these years of heinous acts perpetuating by the Fulani herdsmen, Myetti Allah, the killing and maiming of innocent Nigerians by the so-called Myetti Allah cattle breeders, the police have not been able to issue such threats or investigate the whole issue and bring out the perpetrators.\n\nThey wonder why police should now be saying that they would be going after those clamouring for their le\u00adgitimate rights.\n\nHe noted that it was disap\u00adpointing that the police which had failed to protect citizens, should be talking of investigat\u00ading self-actualisation agitators, arguing that the attempt might further deepen the disunity in the country.\n\nIn his reaction also, the Media and Communication Secretary of Ilana Omo Oo\u00addua, Adeleye Maxwell, said the decision of the police to investigate agitators was of no effect as long as the agitators carried out their advocacy for self-determination in a peace\u00adful manner.\n\nMr. Maxwell, who spoke on behalf of the Ilana Omo Oodua, said: \u201cIt is our rights to protest for self-determination, we are protesting for self-deter\u00admination in accordance with the law of the land, the UN and AU Constitutions, which Nigeria is even part of attested to this that self-actualisation is our legitimate right.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Constitution also stipulated that self-deter\u00admination protest and demand are our legitimate rights, the only limitation is that it must be done in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cWe have been very careful that our protests are peacefully conducted. Even the police are always on ground to ensure that the protest is not hijacked by hoodlums.\n\n\u201cThey are always on ground to maintain law and order. We have staged the pro\u00adtests in Ibadan. It was peaceful; no life was reportedly lost.\n\n\u201cJournalists were there with well coverage and there were no reports of loss of lives, nor was any protester arrest\u00aded for possession of unlawful arms.\n\n\u201cWe held the protest in Abeokuta in Ogun State. It was also a peaceful one. Some of our people were initially ar\u00adrested by the police, but they were freed when they found nothing implicating or con\u00adtrary on them.\n\n\u201cThey carry no arms, nor ammunitions. We are agitat\u00ading for our legitimate rights as stipulated by laws of the coun\u00adtry. So, I think the IGP is just saying something to impress his boss, as you know his new in that office.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Yoruba Na\u00adtion Global Directorate, the Yoruba shadow government, has expressed surprise at the decision of the police to place separatist groups in the coun\u00adtry under watch, describing it as a ploy to hound the agi\u00adtators.\n\nOtunba Demola Edward, Information Coordinator of the group, said that the Police that failed to protect life and property of the citizenry was promising to chase shadows.\n\nHe declared that the group was unperturbed by the threat, vowing that nothing would stop them from pursuing their desire for independent Yoruba nation.\n\nOtunba Edward said: \u201cWe found it interesting that the Police that failed woefully in its primary duties of main\u00adtaining law and order and securing the lives and proper\u00adties of citizens under the dis\u00adputable Federal Government is now threatening citizens of various nationalities within a mere geographical expression exercising their fundamental human rights of self- deter\u00admination under international law and jurisprudence.\n\n\u201cWhile we view this as a ploy to criminally harass le\u00adgitimate agitators for Yoruba Nation, we say unequivocally that no threats will discourage our determination to demand for actualisation of a sovereign Yoruba nation, which will save our people from the ongoing massacre and the impending genocide by the Fulani backed by government of Nigeria, who are hell bent on forcefully taking over our land.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening to note that the failed Nigeria state is evidently unsafe for Yoruba citizens, as economic woes, incessant kidnapping, raping, and murders by Fulani contin\u00adue to heighten in our land.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate that our quest to exit Nigeria under peaceful, civil and legal means was un\u00addermined by the failed Gen. Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that prop\u00adositions made to the Nigerian government by the Yoruba Na\u00adtion in conjunction with other ethnic nationalities have so far been ignored by Buhari\u2019s ad\u00administration, a Fulani leader under whose watch the atroc\u00adities aforementioned are now a daily common occurrence.\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say that the Yoruba nation is not ignorant of the Fulani-led administra\u00adtion\u2019s plans to execute a grand evil plan to conquer Yoruba land and subjugate Yoruba citizens on their original an\u00adcestral home land.\n\n\u201cWe urge all agitators for Yoruba nation, Middle Belt\u00adans, and Biafra, home and diaspora, to continue their liberation activities without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cThe Directorate takes cog\u00adnisance of the treaties of the Commonwealth, the African Union and United Nations. Our quest for self-determina\u00adtion is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nOtuba Edward, however, urged the Yoruba to remain calm and go about their busi\u00adnesses pending the exit of the nationality from the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nHowever, leader of the Yoruba Youth Socio-Cultural Association (YYSA) World\u00adwide, Comrade Olalekan Hammed, said there was nothing extraordinary in the police monitoring or in\u00advestigating the activities of agitators.\n\n\u201cAs the worldwide youth leader of Yoruba ethnic group, I champion our cause to ensure that Nigeria is re\u00adstructured because we believe that it is the solution to cur\u00adrent problems and the only way through which peace and development could be ascertained.\n\n\u201cIn other words, peaceful and orderly agitation is legit, but some of Oodua and Bi\u00adafra agitators have become deviants.\n\n\u201cThey are ready to kill and destroy their own region all in the name of agitation.\n\n\u201cAt least, nineteen police of\u00adficers have been killed in the last one month in South East by deadly agitators.\n\n\u201cAlthough, none of the Oodua agitators has become so devilish to that extent, but they all have to be checked, I mean, to restrain them from embarking on killing and de\u00adstruction.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it if the police decided to investigate those perceived to be heteroclite among the so-called separatists because destruction will only be a set\u00adback to our region.\n\n\u201cAgitation for restructur\u00ading or secession is part of the citizens\u2019 inalienable rights provided it is done lawfully without shedding of blood.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say that inves\u00adtigating the agitators is a way to hound them, no.\n\n\u201cWe could all see what is happening in the East, where many police stations were set ablaze and officers were mur\u00addered,\u201d Hammed said.",

But fortunately, David Adeleke redirected his narrative and embraced his privileged status with Dami Duro.\n\nAnd \u201cDami Duro\u201d, co-produced by Shizzi, was the perfect introduction to Davido. As one from an affluent family, his background afforded him the leeway to pursue music as a hobbie, but with Dami Duro, Davido stood in our faces, shouting at the top of his lungs \u201cI am from a rich family, I own my representation and no one can stop me\u201d\n\n10 years on, and Davido has walked the talk. He has had an enviable career laden with multiple hit tracks and lots of real awards to brag with.\n\nDavido\u2019s story is one that deserves to be told and this week, NewsWireNGR had a chat with Obinna Agwu, a music executive and talent manager to analyse Davido\u2019s success and detail how his career has been a win for the Afrobeats community.\n\nWhat is the Afrobeat genre?\n\nThere\u2019s Afrobeat and there\u2019s Afrobeats. Afrobeat without the \u2018S\u2019 is the music that Fela worked tirelessly to develop over a long period. From his own band Koola Lobitos to finally refining it to where he started Egypt 80 and everything, and it was because he schooled out there in the West, he took in a lot of their sound and all of that. But at some point, Fela felt the need to really stand apart from the music he had learnt and he wanted to make it more African than more make it more authentic.\n\nSo Afrobeat is the music today that emerged from the genius who spent tireless time in developing and working on it in the 60s.\n\nSo now to the Afrobeats with the \u2018S\u2019. A lot of people are going to say to you that unlike Afrobeat that is a distinct sound with elements, Afrobeats music isn\u2019t particularly a genre. It is just the overarching umbrella sound of the music out of West Africa.\n\nAnother funny thing is that the word Afrobeat was first coined or used by a Ghanaian-based DJ in the UK called DJ Atlantic. He was on radio at a time, and he had a show on a certain radio station and at that point he introduced a lot of African music. I guess after some time he felt the need to call it something, so that\u2019s where Afrobeat came from. Afrobeat is pretty much a sound from West Africa, the overarching sound of the umbrella music from West Africa.\n\nAfrobeats looks like the biggest export from Africa to the world right now, can give us a rundown of the evolution of the genre?\n\nWhen you talk about Afrobeats music, there are a lot of elements and a lot of people to thank. For example In 2005, people like MTV Base made their entry into Nigeria and to Africa. What those platforms did was that they gave us an avenue to expose our music to a bigger and wider audience within Africa and the world.\n\nHowever, at that time what we know as Afrobeats hasn\u2019t quite started to happen so at that time We had the 9ice, we had the P-Square, Naeto C, Ikechukwu, Mo\u2019 Hits, MI and all these people things, so as our music continued to grow I would say it was in early 2010 that Afrobeat started to form and shape up into something, especially with people like Wizkid, and there\u2019s really no way we would talk about Afrobeat victory without bringing the UK into it.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately because the UK ended up playing a huge role that helped in disseminating the sound support, and it was very obvious because we have a lot of Nigerians out there, a lot of Africans out there. So the UK is really much like an annex of Africa, so the UK and the regions of the UK and the people of the UK definitely played the huge role in helping to disseminate the sound support just like in everything, as you start to earn success, more people want to tap in, more people want to understand what you\u2019re doing. So before we knew it people like Drake came in and wanted to do stuff, J Hus plenty people, Skepta, so many people started to identify with the sound and these people came with their own huge following and their own audience. I\u2019d say that Afrobeat as a sound or as a musical consciousness , pretty much started in the 2010s and yes, we are like ten years deep into all of that now. So shout-out to Davido, shout out to Wizkid , shout to all these people who helped to push the sounds up.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Afrobeats rise without mentioning Davido, a man who recently clocks a decade in the industry. What do you think has defined his career so far in the industry?\n\nResilience and Passion. At the initial stage a lot of people did not consider David to be the most obviously talented person.\n\nBut one thing you could tell from David was that this kid was hungry, this kid wanted this thing, this Kid is going to do anything to get it , as God would have it he seems to have financial support on his path, but why I would not talk so much about that is that before David and even after David, we have seen a lot of rich kid , right? So money is not the only reason David is such a star. As a manager and an administrator, I have run with people who have money but their money is for their lifestyle and it\u2019s not for the music and when it\u2019s time to invest in music they would not, but with David , David realised that okay, I have the wherewithal to do what I need to do, he really put his money where his mouth is and he went all out for it.\n\nSo I would say resilience and passion first of all and over time we have seen this guy improve and get better and better. So it\u2019s not hard to say that David has been growing because over time he has shown us that.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Davido has undergone a lot of evolution to stay relevant. What has been the biggest?\n\nFor me, his biggest evolution has been his ability to spot great songs. His ability to work with amazingly gifted people and you must understand that sometimes these people are not necessarily the most affordable people to work it but David has displayed creative maturity over time.\n\nIn Nigeria a lot of people at his level wouldn\u2019t be open to come and say \u2018somebody wrote this song with me, or I took the song from somebody\u2019. But, we have seen David do that from time to time . From \u2018Gobe\u2019 to T Spize that wrote \u2018Aye\u2019 to collaborating with Peruzzi on a lot of songs, to working with Adekunle Gold on One Milli , so you can tell that David has a mentality that a lot of his peers and people do not have.\n\nHe is open , he understands music, he goes to a place and hears a song and says Yo, this song, I want this song, I need to sing this song, I would buy this song off you, what is it going to take , so over time David has shown that he is an incredible Musician and he has the ear for good music and also likes working with with gifted people.\n\nA lot of people say his special sauce is creating monster hits, how true is this? And how easy is it?\n\nHis special sauce is recognising monster hit, so when somebody tries to downplay David\u2019s greatness and say he is not talented, I\u2019m like yoo, it takes a lot of talent to spot hit, it was this boy who spotted \u2018Gobe\u2019 and he bought it, this guy who spotted \u2018Aye\u2019, and he bought it, he spotted even \u2018Fem\u2019.\n\nHe said some people were working at his studio, the song was not even meant for him, he now pulled up, he heard it and he was like yoo I\u2019m using this work, it takes talent to be able to spot those things you know and the ability to collaborate with very gifted people, all these things are talent, these are things his father\u2019s money cannot afford him. So yeah, Davido definitely has superpower for creating songs that are amazing.\n\n\u2018IF\u2019 was written by Tekno so you can tell that this guy is actually steps ahead of his peers. He is able to collaborate with the right people and he is able to spot amazing songs and say so you know what we are going to do with this one.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference in delivery even when one buy songs\n\nDefinitely, and he does that well. Like \u2018Gobe\u2019, he ended up not using the actual beat and he got.bI think he got Chizzi, and David has done so many things like this with his songs. So you can tell that this guy really has something, he knows something, something that can\u2019t just be learnt, something his father\u2019s money can\u2019t buy.\n\nWhat other elements of music marketing has Davido mastered to keep him going for over ten years?\n\nI think his use of social media has been very impressive over the years and that\u2019s why If I am not mistaken I think he even has more followers than Wizkid on Instagram.\n\nThat says a lot because Wizkid is quite a superstar. But for some reason, that followers count means that more people are trying to see something on David\u2019s side than on Wiz\u2019s side and it\u2019s just that when people love you and they admire you , they want to know more about you and David let\u2019s you in. You see his friends, you see his travels, you see his kids and even when he\u2019s ranting he puts it up there and another thing, David is so giving off his platform, that\u2019s something we have seen over time, I\u2019ve seen and then when he sees something that\u2019s amazing, he is always making sure he finds a way behind it through his platform I think in some way these things get to people and they love you more and support you.\n\nAlso, David is actually a businessman and he is very clinical about these things. If you get on YouTube and say you want to sit down and watch David\u2019s videos, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time there. And you know that these videos are shot by Clarence Peters. If you put it into naira and kobo, you would see that we are talking about hundreds of millions so a lot of people make money and they struggle putting that money back into their business but not David.\n\nHe\u2019s a great businessman and his use of social media has been very impressive and he has a heart of working with the right people.\n\nA lot of people have pointed at his humility in recalling Asa, as a key moment in his career\n\nYou see what he displayed, these are the things people love about David. David\u2019s ability to be honest and to just come out of a situation and say this is what it is.\n\nLike the project he did with Sony, that international project, David would openly say to you, I don\u2019t like that project, that project carries my name but I do not like it, I don\u2019t think it was me, I don\u2019t think I was allowed to do what I really wanted to do. It\u2019s not a lot of artistes who are able to look at their work and say ohhh I do not like this work .\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big level of honesty and sincerity and I think people can really connect with that. And on a human level when you have that type of understanding, it puts you in a place where you can learn and get better.\n\nTo Asa, I happen to be there to some extent. Asa started out working for his uncle\u2019s record company, Storm records, and of course you know Storm records at the time in Nigeria were like the biggest record label Nigeria. So that gave him a platform, that gave him access to do a lot of things and meet a lot of people. So I remember there was a time when Asa was hosting club nights in a lot of big clubs or Storm was handling PR for a lot of big clubs and it was him who would directly manage that relationship. So overtime, this guy had a strong contact base and I saw him first hand deploy all of this to push his music forward.\n\nAnd David is very clinical in his actions. He knows what he wants to do and he goes for it. We talked about \u201cBack When\u201d, do you know that he paid Naeto C for that feature? One would think that because Asa is his little cousin things would come easily, no, that feature was paid for and it was business, at that point how many people were paid? I think he paid about a million naira for him to do the audio and then be on the video. The video was shot by Clarence Peters, and over time we have seen how many more Clarence Peters videos he has made. Meaning that he wants the quality of the work to be good every step of his way .\n\nI can\u2019t say how the disagreement happened, but these things happen, at some point they fell in and then Kamal came in and a lot of things. But it takes a lot of honesty and sincerity for you to look at something and say, I should go back to this guy, this really loves me and was out for my best interest and he did just that.\n\nAnd from a manager\u2019s point of view, that was for me a key moment in the industry because I don\u2019t remember seeing stuff like that happen a lot of times. When an artiste falls out with his manager, and they go back to do their thing and honestly say \u2018you\u2019re the person who can do this thing, I\u2019m sorry about everything, let us just keep going\u2019. I strongly believe that as we celebrate David we ought to celebrate Asa as well.\n\nA lot of people think 2016 was Davido\u2019s biggest moment. I saw a video on twitter and it was a thread of different renowned celebrities singing those 2016 fire songs, FIA, IF and Fall. There was even a Kanye West sample. How did David crack the international scene with those songs?\n\nLike I said, David is very passionate, very driven, when he feels like it\u2019s time to get things done, he goes out to get it. Yes, he was already shutting things down on the Africa front, but that \u2018IF\u2019 victory was a calculated promo plan on their path.\n\nI\u2019m sure he must have sent them back some decent dollars to some announcers in American and possibly gotten some help with the international labels he was in at that time. This was someone basically saying I think it\u2019s about time we get this thing done and he went all out and then made it happen. It took some time but eventually the figures and everything started to add up. That was another coordinated plan by David and his team.\n\nDavido has amassed over a billion streams so far and I think that\u2019s very rich, how critical is digital streaming to the growth of Afrobeats?\n\nVery critical, and it is not like we have a choice because digital streaming is where the parties are right now. There\u2019s nobody who is trying to engage with your physical products anymore and there\u2019s nobody trying to buy your VHS or anything.\n\nSo it\u2019s not like we have a choice but it\u2019s a good thing people think that we were deemed enough to engage in those platforms and we woke up to the right technology and partnership of technology early enough. Imagine that we made all these things happen without our own numbers being registered on platforms like Spotify. Spotify just only came to Nigeria this year. So it just shows that despite all the numbers you have been seeing on Spotify, Nigerians in Nigeria our numbers are not even there.\n\nIt just shows how much better these things are going to be, and we have Audiomack, we have YouTube, we have Apple music, we have Spotify these brands have also realised that we Nigerians are an important market. And shout out to Nigerians in diaspora, they continue to push the culture forward. I like to think that they are the unsung heroes of Afrobeats music, because Nigerians everywhere and we can make music everywhere. Maybe that\u2019s the advantage we have over other countries because of the chances that you\u2019re going to find Nigerians everywhere. We are always travelling so It\u2019s easy for our music to travel as well. Hopefully, the internet data can get cheaper and more people can be able to access smart phones and all these gadgets and then stream it down and more people can be able to jam in and help grow this ecosystem.\n\nBurnaboy and Wizkid, recently bagged the grammy awards, will Davido get one soon?\n\nI think David is very close to it, because away from the music, the Grammy sometimes can tend to be like a popularity contest sometimes and, David is quite high up there and more than anything this dude has shown us that he has the ability to continue to bag out this heat. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any stopping that soon. This guy is not even 30 years old yet so David definitely has a lot of time on his clock to go out there and make it happen. He has the pedigree, he has the connections, he has the finance, he has everything, and ultimately he has music.\n\nI like to think eventually, David is going to be on his stage, hold his neck and say \u2018E choke\u2019 at some point.\n\nIn a recent interview with Ebuka, Davido said stuff like, Grammy no be by force. Do you think he can be as intentional as Burna Boy was or probably deviate from his light hearted niche?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think David has found his sweet spot. It\u2019s almost like we have forgotten but the huge positive uprising that happened last year, which is the EndSARS movement, David\u2019s song ended up being the song track for that whole movement.\n\nSo this man makes impactful music, he has the pedigree to back it up, He has the fanbase, he has the people, he has everything. So David has found his sweet spot. I don\u2019t think everyone has to sound the same.\n\nFor Burnaboy from the job, for those of us who were following him, everyone saw the view that at some point this guy called Burna Boy is going to win a Grammy. I\u2019m one of those people who wasn\u2019t surprised. I was literally just counting down to the day, he\u2019s that gifted, and his international appeal and his close relationship with Atlantic. Atlantic realised they had a gem in their hand and they really went out to position him like one.\n\nHow do you make an album like that and you do not have a Grammy? It\u2019s impossible. Diddy is your executive producer, Anderson Park is playing drums in there and Youssou N\u2019Dour is in there, you know, and all this other thing, and then you have the world\u2019s famous Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin\u2019s on that record. So every step of the way, you know this was a Grammy product, this was positioned for that and it eventually got it. Besides, a year before he had gotten a nomination, the one that he lost to another African legend Angelique Kidjo, so everybody just knew that it\u2019s only a matter of time, this guy is gonna get this nomination again and he\u2019s going to win. So, I have no doubt in my mind that as long as David continues to do his thing, he is going to win it at some point.\n\nWould there be any career regret if Davido never wins a Grammy?\n\nNo, there will be none. He is an accomplished artiste as it is. It was this year that Nas got his Grammy for the first time and there are plenty of other people that never got the Grammy but we know that these people are some of the finest artistes. Do you know Snoop Dogg never won a Grammy?\n\nSo there are plenty of other people like that, so sometimes these things happen. Maybe you dropped a project in a year, well then just so happened to be like a bigger or more popular project and then, you know there are those variables and these things that happen. So in my opinion David is really an accomplished musician, he has traveled round the world, he has met everybody, he has made money, he has made a clout, I mean what else is there to do? At this point he just needs to keep making music because that is what he has feelings for.\n\nWhat can young hungry artistes out there learn from Davido?\n\nBe open to collaboration. Know that using a songwriter does not mean you\u2019re a terrible musician, sometimes you write alone, sometimes you need to sing somebody\u2019s perspective to give your music that bit of freshness.\n\nSecond, you need to show that you want it, you need to be hungry about this thing, like I said before, David is not the first rich kid we have seen, but we have seen plenty of them who didn\u2019t seem to have that fight in them.\n\nThird, you have to be passionate, this is what you love, submit to it. One vibe you get from David is that this brother has genuine love for music. Just follow your heart, be passionate, be hardworking and if you have money to put in, put it in, be an entrepreneur.\n\nI want to add something else, just in case we don\u2019t get to touch that. Let us not forget that in the history of artistes who run record labels, we possibly have not had anyone that has been successful as DMW. So away from being an artiste, even as an executive or a label guy, David has been hugely successful, Mayorkun is big, Perruzi is big, Dremo, all these other people, so unlike all other guys who have tried to start a label, even the people he\u2019s competing with, a lot of them do not have anything going on that level, but away from David being this guy, he has also successfully built a platform that is huge as well, so David the executive also deserves a lot of kudos.\n\nHas Afrobeats peaked with this Grammy win and its present level of influence?\n\nI do not think so. If anything, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re just getting started. I was recently saying to someone, these days it appears like the producers outside Nigeria are even starting to make better Afrobeats production or songs than us. People like Jay Five, people like P2J, there\u2019s this guy in Los Angeles who does work for Tiwa savage and Seyi Shay plenty of these people, these guys are making incredible stuff. You know how a black American cannot really really say hip hop is our thing anymore because in Asia they now make hip hop, Africans make hip hop, a lot of people make hip hop, so that\u2019s the beauty of your tradition on your product going across. It sort of gets to a place where it feels like it\u2019s no longer yours anymore because a lot of people have now bought into your product and they love it so I see that happening with Afrobeats.\n\nAnother thing is that these guys are still young and they\u2019re going to continue making music. Wizkid is a big superstar, look at what he did with Made in Lagos, so projects like that help to reinforce the importance of this genre, people like Burna Boy, Burna Boy is only just getting started, Davido is a young man, he\u2019s just getting started, let\u2019s not even talk about the younger people who are coming behind them, Buju, Joeboy, Fireboy DML, Tems, all these people, so I think we\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nHow can the government key into the million dollars Afrobeats industry now and provide active and actual beneficial support to the growth of the industry now?\n\nMaybe that ship might have sailed because before we got into this digital age, we used to beg the government to come and help us stop piracy, come and help us stop this people who are creating our CDs and selling, come and help us stop these people in Alaba who are faking our products, but now with digital, nobody even cares about them anymore, so you find out that more and more we don\u2019t even need to talk to these people, we don\u2019t need them for anything. The labels have stepped up, were getting investments, international labels are coming in to partner with our local guys here, we have big artiste development and artiste relation companies like Platoon, like ONErpm, like Empire, like Orchard and all this people coming to Nigeria to set up shop, so it appears that through our own sheer determination and hard work, we have taken this thing to a level where it has really taken off, all the government can do is to congratulate people where the would help us.\n\nSo there\u2019s no role left for the government now?\n\nPerhaps that ship has sailed, so maybe they should perhaps help us add more event centres, you know just put in laws and regulations that help people to do business more easily. But generally, the success has gone beyond them.\n\nFans of Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy are always pitching against themselves on social media. Is this beneficial to the artistes or can it be very damaging to their career and industry growth in the long term?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Because these people are the people who speak up and drum up support for these people that helps to take them to the next level. So now the onus is on the artistes and their handlers to understand that hey, you people must remain friends ooh. You must know that these people would always come with these competitive problems but you guys must know that hey, fans are just doing what fans do.\n\nHowever the competitiveness is what makes it fun. A lot of times, if there\u2019s no competition people are not really bothered to go the extra mile, so there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\nDavido coming to tweet and say \u2018Yo, my fans stop doing this doesn\u2019t change anything\u2019, yeah, you get on Twitter you would discover that there are a lot of handles that are dedicated solely to these guys and all they do is talk about them, tweet them and drop fights and everything. So at that point it is out of your hand, it is just up to you to understand that now it\u2019s part of the game, but these people are my brothers and we should not let what the fans say make us enemies but however, the noise that the fans are making out is important.\n\nObinna Agwu is a music executive and talent manager who has had in his clientele MI Abaga amid a plethora of other artistes.\n\nListen to his expert analysis of happenings in the entertainment industry on Listening Session Podcast",

          "title": "The Economist: Nigeria\u2019s economy is stuck in a rut",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 4\n\nRising oil prices will bring short-term relief, butmay delay essential reforms.\n\nTALK THAT everything is expensive fills the air at a market in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital. Since February the minibus fare from home to the market has doubled, says Emmanuel Mokwe, who sells kitchen utensils. So has the price of food, he adds grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos,\u201d says Dotun Babande, who runs a juice shop across town.\n\nInflation is running at 18%. For food it is 23%, the highest in two decades. More than half of Nigerians are underemployed or unemployed. Before covid-19 about 80m of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic andpopulation growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023,says the World Bank.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic woes also help explain a vertiginous rise in crime. More people were kidnapped in the first four months of this year thanall of last year, according to Jose Luengo-Cabrera of the World Bank.This has added to worsening violence around three flashpoints: thejihadists of Boko Haram in the north-east; a long-standing conflict between farmers and cattle- herders across central Nigeria; and fighting between government forces and Igbo separatists in the south-east.\n\nCovid-19 has slammed economies everywhere, but Nigeria\u2019s economicmalaise predates the pandemic. GDP per person has fallen every yearsince 2015, when oil prices slumped (see chart). The World Bank reckons that by the end of the year real income per person in Nigeria, home to one in six of sub- Saharan Africa\u2019s people, will be at the same level as it was in the 1980s. Reform is desperately needed, but fiendishly difficult to enact.\n\nAlthough oil makes up about 9% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, it accounts for 80% of export earnings and about half of government revenues. A long slump in its price\u2014from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to less than half thatfor most of last year\u2014has squeezed the supply of foreign exchange.\n\nNormally economies would adjust by letting their exchange rates fall, making imports more expensive. This can be painful in the short term since it fuels inflation. But usually it helps boost exports by making them more competitive. If Nigeria could make, grow or mine more forexport, it would be less vulnerable to swings in the oil price.\n\nInstead, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has restricted imports in an effort to prop up the currency, which he sees asa measure of Nigeria\u2019s strength. In an attempt to conserve dollars, thecentral bank has banned those intending to import almost 50 items from buying foreign currency. Last month wheat and sugar were added to the list. In 2019 Mr Buhari closed Nigeria\u2019s land borders to goods to stop smugglers undermining local producers. Both moves have fuelled food-price inflation.\n\nThey have also hobbled manufacturing firms by making it hard for themto obtain inputs. Manufacturers would be lucky if they get 20% of the forex they request, says Muda Yusuf of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ajibade Oluwabukunmi imports medical equipment and uses the volatile black market, where dollars cost almost 30% more than the official rate. \u201cNigeria is in a shambles,\u201d he laments. Despite all its unorthodox controls, the central bank was forced to devalue the naira twice last year. Businesses are getting neither a stable currency nor access to dollars.\n\nThe government may slowly be changing its tune. Bismarck Rewane, an economist who is also on the president\u2019s council of economic advisers, says that \u201cthe futility of a Robinson Crusoe economy became very clear for everybody\u201d. The government is starting to pay more attention to exporters, he claims, pointing to the partial reopening of land bordersfor goods in December and Nigeria\u2019s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2019.\n\nYet sustained growth in exports requires more than just opening the border. Many firms are uncompetitive because they are hampered by red tape and government failures. \u201cGovernment is the biggest problem for business in Nigeria,\u201d says Bashir Abdulrahman of Credent Capital and Advisory, an investment bank.\n\nElectricity blackouts are maddeningly frequent. Roads are often poor and ports clogged up. Moving a container 20km from the port of Lagosto the city can cost $4,000, almost as much as shipping it 12,000km from China. Nigeria ranks 131st out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s ease-of- doing-business index. Although some industries, such as information technology, are growing, this is \u201cin spite of the government\u201d, says Tayo Oviosu of Paga, a mobile-payments company.\n\nThe government has tried to give the poor more aid to get them through the pandemic. It also promises to improve infrastructure. But spending on salaries and other annual costs chews up 75% of the federal budget, leaving little money to invest in roads or railways. With a view to freeing funds for infrastructure, the government last year promised to cut costly fuel subsidies. Yet that has been halted in the face of opposition.\n\nThe stalled reform is typical of Nigeria\u2019s troubles. For decades cash from oil has been used to subsidise things like fuel and electricity. The easy revenue also allowed the federal and state governments to getaway with abysmal tax collection. Worse, it fostered corruption.\n\nMany Nigerians have had enough. Between 2014 and 2018 the percentage who want to emigrate rose from 36% to 52%, one of thehighest levels in Africa. Rising oil prices this year will ease the shortages and boost government finances. Yet that may reduce the pressure to fix deeper economic problems, admits Kayode Fayemi, a state governor. Nonetheless, he believes there is an \u201calmost overwhelming consensus\u201d on the need to restructure the economy. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it,\u201d he warns, \u201cwe run the risk of disintegration.\u201d ?\n\nThis article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \u201cStuck in a rut\u201d for the Economist Magazine.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "title": "Isa Ali Pantami \u2013 The Inside Story of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications & Digital Economy",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

          "text": "Barring any last-minute change of mind, the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and its affiliate unions will on Monday embark on a five-day warning strike over the recent disengagement of civil servants by the state government.\n\nThe planned move followed Governor Nasir El-Rufai\u2019s announcement in April to disengage civil servants in the state, citing fiscal reasons.\n\nEl-Rufai said a significant amount of the statutory federal allocations to the state is being spent on the wages of public servants.\n\nBut the NLC has vowed to resist the action of the state government, accusing the governor of not being sensitive to the plight of the workers.\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna on Sunday, the NLC Chairman in the state, Ayuba Suleiman, disclosed that the industrial action will be accompanied by a peaceful protest which will be led by the President of the Union, Ayuba Wabba and other labour leaders across the country.\n\nHe explained that the strike which will involve grounding of all socio-economic activities in both public and private sectors in a bid to force the Kaduna State Government to reverse the sack of over 7,000 local government workers and teachers and also suspend its plan to sack another 11,000 civil servants any moment from now.\n\nREAD ALSO: SERAP Writes Lawan, Gbajabiamila, Seeks Probe Of Missing N4.1bn NASS Funds\n\n\u201cWe are very much ready for the industrial action on Monday and it is going to be a dual activity.

We have had series of meetings today, we met with various stakeholders including all sectors of the economy in the state towards the success of this industrial action.\n\n\u201cIn total, you have about 7,700 workers that are disengaged at the local government level.

That is why in this April, because of their intention, over 20,000 workers have not yet received their April salary.\u201d\n\nBut reacting, the Kaduna State Government defended its decision, saying it is in the interest of over 10 million citizens of the state.\n\nThe Commissioner for Local Government, Jafaru Sani, said not even the threat of industrial action or blackmail by the union will make the state government to reverse its decision.\n\nHe also debunked the claims of the labour union that the government has pencilled down over 11,000 workers for disengagement, adding that there are plans to right-size its public service, but however did give the figures.\n\nThe Commissioner explained that the government\u2019s decision to lay off some workers and political appointees is necessary to enable it cope with fiscal challenges and preserve its ability to use its resources for the entire state.\n\nHe also denied the allegations of anti-labour activities, stressing that Kaduna State workers have been receiving the new minimum wage since 2019.\n\nThe commissioner said: \u201cThis government has reiterated its commitment to the welfare of its workers. It insists that this is sustainable only in the context of the general welfare of residents of the state that the government is mandated to serve.\n\n\u201cIt is not sustainable to persist in spending 84 to 96 per cent of the FAAC received on salaries and personnel cost as has been the experience of the state since October 2020.\u201d",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has written to the Senate President Ahmed Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila to probe a missing 4.1 billion naira budgeted for the National Assembly.\n\nThe agency asked both government officials to \u201cuse their good offices to urgently probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N4.1 billion of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated, diverted or stolen, as documented in the 2016 audited report by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cThese allegations are not part of the disclosure by the Auditor-General in other audited reports that N4.4 billion of National Assembly money is missing, misappropriated, diverted or stolen.\u201d\n\nIn the letter dated 15 May 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cAs part of its legislative and oversight functions, the National Assembly has a key role to play in the fight against corruption in the country. But little can be achieved by the legislative body in the anti-corruption fight if the leadership and members do not first confront the spectre of alleged corruption and mismanagement within their ranks.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also urging Dr. Lawan and Mr. Gbajabiamila: \u201cto identify the lawmakers and staff members suspected to be involved, and hand them over to appropriate anti-corruption agencies to face prosecution, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to ensure full recovery of any missing public funds.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cEnsuring the effective investigation of these fresh allegations, and full recovery of any missing public funds would strengthen the country\u2019s accountability framework, and show that the National Assembly can discharge its constitutional responsibility of amplifying the voices of Nigerians. It will also show that the body is acting in the best interest of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that allegations of corruption continue to undermine economic development, violate social justice, and destroy trust in economic, social, and political institutions. Nigerians bear the heavy economic and social costs of corruption. The National Assembly, therefore, has a responsibility to curb it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2016, N4,144,706,602.68 of National Assembly money is missing, diverted or stolen. The National Assembly paid some contractors N417,312,538.79 without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount in question from the contractors.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly reportedly spent N625,000,000.00 through its Constitution Review Committee between March and June 2016 but without any document. The Auditor-General wants the Clerk to the National Assembly to \u2018recover the amount from the Committee and furnish evidence of recovery for verification.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly spent N66,713,355.08 as \u2018personnel cost\u2019 but \u2018the payees in the Cashbook did not correspond with those in the Bank Statement\u2019. The Auditor-General wants \u2018the irregular expenditure recovered from the officer who approved the payments.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly also reportedly paid N116,162,522.60 to some contractors between April and June 2016 without any document.

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged the President of the Senate Dr. Ahmad Lawan and House Speaker Mr. Femi Gbajabiamila to \u201curgently investigate and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N4.1 billion of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated, diverted, or stolen, as alleged\u201d as documented in the 2016 audited report by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cthese allegations are not part of the disclosure by the Auditor-General in other audited reports that N4.4 billion of National Assembly money is missing, misappropriated, diverted or stolen.\u201d\n\nIn the letter dated 15 May 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cAs part of its legislative and oversight functions, the National Assembly has a key role to play in the fight against corruption in the country. But little can be achieved by the legislative body in the anti-corruption fight if the leadership and members do not first confront the spectre of alleged corruption and mismanagement within their ranks.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also urging Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila: \u201cto identify the lawmakers and staff members suspected to be involved, and hand them over to appropriate anti-corruption agencies to face prosecution, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to ensure full recovery of any missing public funds.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cEnsuring the effective investigation of these fresh allegations, and full recovery of any missing public funds would strengthen the country\u2019s accountability framework, and show that the National Assembly can discharge its constitutional responsibility of amplifying the voices of Nigerians. It will also show that the body is acting in the best interest of the people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that allegations of corruption continue to undermine economic development, violate social justice, and destroy trust in economic, social, and political institutions. Nigerians bear the heavy economic and social costs of corruption. The National Assembly therefore has a responsibility to curb it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2016, N4,144,706,602.68 of National Assembly money is missing, diverted or stolen.

          "text": "Widespread gasoline shortages along the US East Coast began to ease slightly on Saturday as the operator of the nation\u2019s biggest fuel pipeline said it was back to delivering \u201cmillions of gallons per hour\u201d following last week\u2019s cyberattack.\n\nShips and trucks were deployed to fill up storage tanks after the six-day Colonial Pipeline shutdown, the most disruptive cyberattack on record, triggered widespread panic buying that left filling stations across the U.S. Southeast dry.\n\n\u201cWe have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the markets we serve,\u201d said the company, which had begun gradual restart of the pipeline on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 13,400 gas stations surveyed in the east and south by fuel tracking app GasBuddy were experiencing outages on Saturday, down from 16,200 early the previous day.\n\nOn Saturday evening, about 75% of gas stations in Washington, D.C. were still without fuel, an improvement from Friday\u2019s figure of 88%, the app showed. Shortages also eased in North Carolina and Virginia, but were about the same in Georgia.\n\nUS gasoline demand dropped 12.6% from the previous week, probably due to an easing of \u201ccrazed\u201d panic buying just after the pipeline shut, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\n\nThe nationwide average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $3.04 on Saturday, from $2.96 a week ago, according to AAA.\n\nThe pipeline outage accelerated increases in gasoline prices that were \u201calready rising due to higher crude prices and demand ahead of Memorial Day,\u201d said AAA spokeswoman Ellen Edmonds.\n\nShe was referring to the May 31 holiday that traditionally kicks off the U.S. summer driving season.\n\nPlaces served by the pipeline saw the biggest price jumps this week \u2013 with Georgia and the Carolinas up 20 cents per gallon or more \u2013 but they should also see prices decline again as supplies improve, Edmonds said.\n\nFlorence, South Carolina had the nation\u2019s biggest price increase at 30 cents, while prices rose 9 cents in D.C.\n\nShips deployed under emergency waivers were also moving fuel from U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to the northeast, while 18-wheel tanker trunks were ferrying gasoline from Alabama to Virginia, helping to stem the shortages.\n\nUS crude prices could edge higher as refiners process more oil to catch up from the gasoline storage that was drawn down while the pipeline was shuttered, said Robert Yawger, analyst at Mizuho Securities.\n\nThe approach of Memorial Day helps make \u201cthe sense of urgency supersized\u201d for refiners, Yawger added.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Dennis Li was stuck on Friday at a Sunoco gas station that was out of fuel. He had tried to find gas at four stations during the day, with no luck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running on empty to the point where I don\u2019t want to drive anymore,\u201d said Li, who is from Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nThe hacking group blamed for the attack, DarkSide, said it had hacked four other companies including a Toshiba subsidiary in Germany.\n\nColonial Pipeline has not determined how the initial breach occurred, a spokeswoman said this week. The 5,500-mile (8,900-km) pipeline carries 100 million gallons of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel each day to East Coast markets from Texas refineries.\n\nColonial has not revealed how much money the hackers were seeking or whether it paid. Bloomberg News and the New York Times said it paid nearly $5 million.\n\nColonial said it would resume on Monday its regular nomination process, in which shippers seek space on the line.\n\nIt released a revised schedule to shippers, with estimated delivery dates. The schedule suggested that diesel loaded in Atlanta on Friday would arrive at the northernmost point in Linden, New Jersey, 10 days later, as would gasoline.\n\nSteve Boyd, a senior managing director at fuel delivery firm Sun Coast Resources, estimated that with gasoline moving on the pipeline at half Colonial\u2019s normal speed, it could take 12 to 20 days for new deliveries from Gulf Coast refineries to reach Linden.\n\nSun Coast has 75 trucks taking supplies from terminals in Alabama and Georgia to retailers as far away as Virginia.\n\n\u201cIf customers need us for another week or three weeks, we\u2019ll be there,\u201d said Boyd.",

          "text": "The British Museum, the world\u2019s first national public museum, currently holds 700 pieces of the Benin Bronzes collection, more than any other museum and other institutions globally, a former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. John Campbell has said.\n\nCampbell, however, acknowledged that the authorities of the British Museum had agreed \u201cto return the Benin Bronzes collection once the Edo Museum of West African Art, currently under construction in Benin City is completed.\u201d\n\nHe gave this figure in a blog post titled \u201cGermany to Return Some African Art to Nigeria\u201d published on the website of Council for Foreign Relations (CFR), a US non-profit think-tank specialising in international affairs on Wednesday.\n\nMore than a century after British soldiers looted a collection of priceless artifacts from the Kingdom of Benin, some of the Benin bronzes are heading back to Nigeria \u2013 with strings attached.\n\nConsequently, more than 1,000 of the bronzes are held at museums across Europe, with the most valuable collection at the British Museum in London despite that the federal government had canvassed the return of the artifacts since the country gained independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) had struck a deal to return some of the most iconic pieces in the historic collection on a temporary basis to form an exhibition at the new Benin Royal Museum in Edo State within three years.\n\nBut in his blog post, Campbell wrote that the German Minister of Culture, Monika Gr\u00fctters had announced plan to return hundreds of art objects to Nigeria.\n\nCampbell, currently Ralph Bunche Senior fellow for Africa Policy Studies said the origin of the artifacts \u201cis the Benin Royal Palace\u2014located in Benin City situated in Southern Nigeria\u2014looted and destroyed by the British in 1897.\n\n\u201cThe Germans, however, were not in Edo and, presumably, the objects from there were looted objects purchased on the international art market and then donated to German museums.\n\n\u201cThe German decision has raised pressure on London\u2019s British Museum\u2014which holds seven hundred pieces of the Benin Bronzes collection, more than any other museum\u2014and other institutions to lend or return bronzes to Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, according to the former ambassador, as few as 50 pieces of the iconic artifacts remain in Nigeria at present after the looting of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897.\n\nHe said: \u201cCalls for the return of art acquired by Western countries during the colonial period is an old song. Some countries, especially where national identity is weak, see the return of art as a dimension of nation-building.\u201d\n\nSince the nineteenth century, the former US envoy noted that the Greeks had agitated for the British return of the Parthenon sculptures (the \u201cElgin Marbles\u201d).\n\nHe added that the Greek perspective \u201ctakes for granted that the art produced in a particular locale uniquely belongs to the people who live there now, hence the importance of its physical repatriation.\n\n\u201cAnother perspective is that art belongs to humanity as a whole. What matters in that case is the art\u2019s accessibility to all who wish to see and study it and its conservation and security, not its physical location.\n\n\u201cAn issue with respect to the return of African art to Africa has been the lack of places where it could be exhibited, stored securely, and curated. That appears to be changing. The Edo Museum is designed to be a world-class facility.\u201d\n\nHowever, Campbell observed that the museum was located in \u201ca poor, increasingly unstable country. Where sustainable funding will come from or how security of the art can be maintained is unclear.\n\n\u201cThe sponsors of the Edo Museum are looking toward rotating exhibits of artwork to be borrowed from European and American collections and then returned.\n\n\u201cSuch an approach might satisfy those who see the art as a badge of their ethnic or national identity and those who see the art as belonging to all of humanity.\u201d\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",

          "title": "Nigeria: Former US Ambassador Campbell Canvasses True Devolution of Power",
          "text": "A former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has said President Muhammadu Buhari must urgently take a number of steps that could immediately help to salvage the country from collapsing, otherwise, if the current situation continues to deteriorate, the imminent implosion would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with THISDAY, Campbell described the 1914 amalgamation of the Southern and Northern protectorates as an idea by the British colonial rulers for mere administrative convenience, which failed to factor the fault lines into proper account.\n\nListing some of the immediate steps to include addressing the police and military\u2019s age-old issue of human rights abuses, he added that the agitations in some quarters for secession could be also addressed if the federal government considered the logic in power devolution.\n\n\u201cRight away, it would be those steps that could be taken that would show Nigerian people that the government is moving to address the issues that bedevil the country. I would start with police reform and also, seeking to address the question of human rights abuses by both the police and the military,\u201d Campbell told THISDAY.\n\nThe former US ambassador and the Ralph Bunche senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations also recommended that the federal government should seriously consider a constitution that addresses the aspiration of the masses and endorsed by them.\n\nHe argued that the previous as well as the current constitutions used by the Nigerian government were imposed and did not address Nigeria\u2019s genuine political faultlines and aspirations, including its various ethnic nationalities, and urged those in power to pursue a course of rewriting the constitution that genuinely takes into consideration current issues and realities.\n\nCampbell explained: \u201cThe amalgamation of Nigeria by the British was done for their own administrative convenience without any consultation of Nigerians and without even very much thinking about what the consequences might be of putting together in a single unit 350 different ethnic groups that had little in common with each other.\n\n\u201cBut, I would suggest that that approach has continued. Nigeria\u2019s constitutions had been imposed first by the British, later by various military regimes, and was never submitted to the Nigerian people for a vote or for ratification.\u201d\n\nThe senior fellow at the CFR think-tank maintained that Nigeria\u2019s current constitution mimicked that of the U.S. but is generally relics of the British colonial rule and military regimes that had superintended Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe current constitution, in many respects, mimics that of the United States. In the immediate post-independence period, the country\u2019s constitution essentially mimicked that of the Westminster way of governance. Maybe these western models have shortcomings, when they are imposed on 350 different ethnic groups,\u201d Campbell observed.\n\nHe, however, warned that if the government and the political class remained indifferent to the current nationwide crises, Nigeria might end up in what he described as an \u201cunmitigated disaster.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWell, implosion of the country would be an unmitigated disaster. Whether that occurs or not is very largely up to Nigerians themselves and to their political leadership. The issue, the specific issue that I think is most dangerous at present is the deterioration of security across the country.\n\n\u201cJihadism in the North, conflict over water and land use in the Middle Belt, conflicts that often assume an ethnic and religious dimension, growing separatism sentiment in the South-East and even in Yorubaland the emergence of new institutions, which are not federal. I am talking in particular of the sort of quasi-security force that a number of the Yoruba governors have put together.\u201d\n\nInsisting on a constitution that reflects the aspirations of Nigerians and the current realities, Campbell noted that true federalism where the states are less dependent on the central government would serve the nation better.\n\n\u201cI think if there were genuine federalism in Nigeria, much of the agitation for ethnically based separatism would go away. What are the elements of genuine federalism? First of all, the entities that make up a federal republic need to be able to raise their own revenue and not be dependent on the central government for revenue, and now, almost all of the states are. I think only Lagos state, in fact, is able to raise much, though, not all of the revenue it needs,\u201d he further explained.\n\n\u2022Full Interview in THISDAY",
