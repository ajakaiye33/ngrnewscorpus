          "title": "Probe alleged looting in NPA under Bala Usman, Reps tell EFCC",
          "text": "The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to immediately investigate the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Hadiza Bala-Usman, over alleged looting of revenue under her management.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement issued on Monday by the Minority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu, said the All Progressives Congress administration had crippled the nation\u2019s economy and brought untold hardships to Nigerians.\n\nThe statement was titled \u2018NPA Looting: Reps Minority Caucus Asks EFCC to Investigate Bala-Usman.\u2019\n\nThe opposition lawmakers, therefore, demanded a \u201cmore drastic step by anti-graft agencies to recover the stolen funds as well as prosecute all involved in the looting spree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that a party that came to power with the promise of fight corruption, build the economy, and fight insecurity has ended up destroying whatever gains that were made before it came to power,\u201d the lawmakers.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cThe minority caucus in the House of Representatives is alarmed by the alleged looting of over N165bn operating surplus as well as other diverted funds running into billions of naira, by top officials of the Nigerian Port Authority.\u201d\n\nThe caucus described as \u201canother sad commentary on the brimming corruption in the APC administration,\u201d the \u201cmindless lootings of such stupendous resources at a time the country was writhing in the throes of worsening insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, asked the EFCC to \u201cimmediately take in the indicted Managing Director, Hadiza Bala-Usman, and commence a system-wide investigation with a view to prosecuting her, if found wanting.\u201d\n\nAccording to the opposition lawmakers, such a huge alleged economic crime against the nation should not be left to an administrative panel of enquiry but committed to an anti-graft agency for an independent investigation.\n\nThe caucus expressed concerns that by committing the alleged NPA looting to an administrative panel, political manipulations and partisan influences had taken precedence over what should have been a system-wide investigation into alleged monumental fraud.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cOur caucus holds that the mere suspension of the indicted Managing Director of the NPA, Hadiza Bala-Usman, and the resort to an administrative panel of enquiry even after the report by the supervising Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, exposed an unremitted and possibly diverted operating surplus of N165bn, amounts to romancing and perfuming corruption by the APC-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe minority caucus also believes that the recourse to an administrative instead of a full-scale criminal investigation can only serve as decoy to shield some other APC government officials involved in the looting spree at NPA and other affiliated agencies in the transport sector.\n\n\u201cThis is because, apart from the unremitted N165bn cited by the minister, other documents and reports from the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation had also uncovered several sleaze, including unremitted deduction to Federal Inland Revenue Service amounting to N3,667,750,470, $148,845,745.04, \u20ac4,891,449.50 and \u00a3252,682.14.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to an audit query of N15.18bn allegedly stolen through inflated Corporate Social Responsibility projects/programmes under the watch of the suspended NPA Managing Director.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the suffering people of Nigeria, our caucus is particularly very worried that such monumental lootings are going on at a time terrorists, bandits, unknown gunmen and criminal militias are reigning supreme across the length and breadth of the country, and life has consequently become the cheapest article in the country.\n\n\u201cWe imagine that such resources, if channelled to the security sector and well managed, would have made a world of difference in addressing the problem of insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nThe President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is probing alleged non-remittance of about N165bn operating surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Fund by the NPA. Bala-Usman has since been suspended.\n\nThe government had figured out discrepancies in the remittance of operating surpluses by the NPA to the CRF for two consecutive years under the leadership of Bala-Usman.\n\nA total of about N73.61bn (N56.3bn in 2017 and N17.31bn in 2018) realised within the two-year period was not remitted to the CRF as expected by the government, although the suspended NPA boss provided explanations to the contrary.\n\nAlso, the Federal Ministry of Transportation in a May 4, 2021, letter to the President claimed that the NPA failed to remit N165.32bn to the CRF from 2016 to 2020 and called for an investigation and audit of the financial accounts of the authority\n\nBut in a letter, with reference MD/17/MF/VOL-XX/541, dated May 5, 2021 and addressed to the Chief of Staff to the President, Bala-Usman said the NPA was aware of Buhari\u2019s approval for the Federal Ministry of Transportation to conduct an audit of the accounts of the NPA and its remittances to the CRF.\n\nIn the letter, she explained that the audited financial statements of the NPA provided operating surpluses in 2017 and 2018 that were contrary to what were arrived at by the Office of the Chief of Staff to the President.\n\nIn another development, the embattled Bala-Usman had stated that she had no shady deal with the President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote.\n\nBala-Usman had reportedly been involved in a clandestine ploy to short change Integrated Logistics Services\u2019 in favour of Africa\u2019s richest man, Dangote.\n\nThe suspended NPA MD stated that the ports authority had an executive management team, which considered and took business decisions on all assets of the authority in the best interest of Nigeria.",

Up till today, I have made every effort with the Nigerian Embassy in Shanghai to see how his body can be brought to Nigeria for burial, but they told me that the borders are shut, that there is nothing they can do about the situation.\n\n\u201cThey were suggesting to me to cremate his remains. And I found out that it is their culture. Cremation is not our culture, especially in Igbo land because we have roots with the Jews who use to lay their people to rest and give them the last honour.\n\nAccording to her, life has been very difficult taking care of his two children, aged 9 and 7, and urged Nigerian officials serving in China to come to her aid.\n\nALSO READ: Truck loaded with ammunition discovered in Anambra\n\n\u201cI have two little children, 9 and 7 years.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has converted 1,374 voting points in Akwa Ibom State to Polling Units in the expansion of voter access to Polling Units exercise across the country.\n\nThe Resident Electoral Commissioner,(REC) in the state, Mr. Mike Igini who made this known during the stakeholders meeting held weekend in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, said the new Polling Units(PUs), were added to the existing 2,980 to bring the total number of PUs in the state to 4,354.\n\nIgini explained that the expansion of voter access to the Polling Units project in the country has become very important because it gives spice and piquancy to democracy as well as meaning and purpose to the right to vote.\n\nHe stressed that the phenomenal increase in the number of registered voters relative to the limited 2,980 Polling Units had led to over-crowded and over-congested Polling Units in the state during past elections.\n\nHe stressed\u201d This is the situation the Commission is seeking address given that limited access to polling units have become a discouraging factor for voter participation and the voting process, resulting in delays, disruptions, violence, and voter apathy.\n\n\u201cTo address these problems, the Commission pursuant to its power under section 42 of the Electoral Act to establish a sufficient number of polling units in each Registration Area and allot voters to such polling Units\u201d decided to convert the existing and well-known one thousand, three hundred seventy-four (1,374) voting points to full-fledged Polling Units.\n\n\u201cThis brings the total number of polling units in Akwa Ibom State to four thousand, three hundred and fifty-four (4,354). The entire ongoing process is data-driven and based on demographic and spatial considerations.\n\n\u201cWithout access to convenient voting locations on election day, the right to vote becomes meaningless. The Commission shall remain focused on these and other important integrity-driven issues of the electoral process in the country.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all stakeholders to continue to support the Commission, seek information from the Commission, and try to understand the processes we are putting in place in our efforts at building trust and confidence through this seamless polling unit reforms to increase citizens participation in future elections\u201d\n\nAddressing the stakeholders\u2019 meeting, the State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel thanked the INEC, for initiating such a fruitful, important, and historical project aimed at ensuring credible and successful future elections throughout the country, particularly in Akwa Ibom state.\n\nEmmanuel was represented by his deputy, Mr. Moses Ekpo commended the stakeholders drawn from all registered political parties in the state, groups, and associations as well as the security agencies for coming out to support the effort of the commission.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, you will agree with Igini who has gone too far to state specific reasons why this has become necessary at this time.

A small group of adults stood nearby, some of them audibly sobbing, along with a small child.\n\nFreddie Marquez, 33, said his mother-in-law was one of the victims and that he had been at the party but left around 10:30 pm on Saturday.\n\nSometime after midnight, he received a call from the son of one of the women at the party, who was crying on the phone.\n\n\u201cSomebody came in and shot everybody,\u201d Marquez told Reuters news agency, relating what he had been told on the phone.\n\nThe Denver Post quoted neighbour Yenifer Reyes as saying she was awakened by the sound of gunfire.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a thunderstorm. Then I started hearing sirens,\u201d Reyes told the newspaper.\n\nShe said she saw police take children out of the trailer and put them into a squad car.\n\n\u201cThey were crying hysterically,\u201d Reyes said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gunman rains bullets on female student in Ekiti\n\nPolice on Sunday had yet to release the identities of the shooter or victims.\n\n\u201cMy heart breaks for the families who have lost someone they love and for the children who have lost their parents,\u201d Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement.\n\nGovernor Jared Polis noted the attack happened on Mother\u2019s Day in the US, \u201cas many of us are spending the day celebrating the women in our lives who have made us the people we are today\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was Colorado\u2019s worst mass shooting since a gunman killed 10 people at a Boulder supermarket on March 22, and is the latest in a series of mass shootings in the US.\n\nThe Boulder attack came less than a week after a 21-year-old gunman was accused of fatally shooting eight people at three Atlanta-area day spas in the state of Georgia.\n\nColorado has seen at least two other prominent deadly rampages that shook the nation: the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 15 people including the two perpetrators, and the 2012 shooting in an Aurora movie theatre that killed 12 people and wounded about 70. The Aurora shooter is serving a life sentence.\n\nThe recent shootings have revived the gun control debate, with Democratic President Joe Biden calling them a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d and calling for new legislation from Congress.\n\nBut he faces serious opposition from gun rights advocates including Republicans and some Democrats.\n\n(Newsnow.co.uk)",

Postings in the NA are routine exercises and are based on professional competencies not as portrayed by the baseless publication.\n\n*For the records, let be clear in everyone\u2019s mind that the NA does not train, deploy or operate along ethnic, religious, tribal or regional divides. Senior officers are posted to command units based on their capability and competence taking into consideration their posting history.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Officers are the most frequently posted personnel of the NA. However, because of the bias and seed of discord that the author of the report wanted to sow, it did not allow him to do a thorough background check of his report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201d Part of the poorly scripted article states that NA\u2019s deployment is based on ethical line. This is one of the dumbest opinions of the writer.\n\n\u201cTo put the record straight, while it is true that the General Officer Commanding 82 Division Enugu, Major General Taoreed Lagbaja is from South West, the Commander 34 Brigade Owerri Brigadier General Raymond Utsaha is from the North Central.\n\n\u201cMajor General Gold Chibuisi is of the southeast extraction and is also the General Officer Commanding 2 Division Ibadan which is the largest in a number of states under command including 4 Brigade in Edo State.\n\n\u201d Equally, Brigadier General Farouk Mijinyawa was never the Commander of 16 Brigade as misrepresented by the writer.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore clear that the concocted story lacks everything in terms of credibility and exists only in the pigment of the author\u2019s imagination.\n\n\u201cThe NA urge the general public to know that in the past months, several subversive elements have attempted to discredit the formidable security network in the South East and the NA in line with her constitutional roles of aiding the civil authority deployed officers and men to checkmate the activities of these bad elements who are bent on wrecking havoc in the region. The amateurish article presented in a self-styled fictitious movie-like scenario devoid of even the basic rudiments of a news report is simply unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe uncoordinated and poorly written article exposes the real intent albeit the very low IQ of the author and that speaks volumes on the motive of the publisher.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the NA would like to request all peace-loving Nigerians to disregard the content of the said article in its entirety as it lacks common logic.\n\n\u201cThe NA under the able leadership of the Chief of Army Staff Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru remains committed to the defence of the territorial integrity of Nigeria as well as protecting lives and properties of all citizens and residents in Nigeria.\u201d",

No parent is proud of their children exposing boobs and Butts 2. Every parent wants the best for their children irrespective of Gender.\u201d\n\n@CRawkeen said: \u201cI saw the video where Davido\u2019s daughter Hailey was trying to twerk and he quickly cautioned her \u201chey don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t do that, that is for \u00e0w\u1ecdn \u1ecdm\u1ecd wobe not for good girls\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sweet to watch other people\u2019s daughter twerk but not your own child.\u201d\n\n@iconic_remi stated: \u201cMan wants to raise a queen not a bitch.\u201d\n\n@Chigbo_Uchenna tweeted: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want his daughter to do but pay other people\u2019s daughters to do that even with half-naked pictures tell me again this life balance?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n@one_dosh said: \u201cWhat Davido did to his daughter is amazing, teach your daughters good morals.

          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nDespite disbursing $18 billion stimulus package and about N39 trillion loans to customers in the last one year, some vocal critics of the Nigerian banking industry have accused it of being a major contributor to the menace of corruption, poverty, unemployment, insurgency and related crimes ravaging the country today.\n\nAccording to Prof Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno State, whose domain is under the Boko Haram seige, poor banking support for a critical sector like agriculture, particularly in the Northern Nigeria, has affected and weakened the once vibrant sector thereby negatively distorting economic development in the region.\n\nThe governor lamented that as a result of the banking industry failures \u201cthe three geo-political zones in Northern Nigeria are now rated as zones with high poverty indices that are worse than those in other zones. There is insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, robbery, corruption, fraud, stealing and other vices. Indeed, poverty in Nigeria, as a whole, not just in the North, is being caused by corruption.\n\nCorruption has been identified as one of the main threats to Nigeria\u2019s ambition of achieving the 2030 goals of Sustainable Developments and its aspiration to lift more than hundred million of Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years,\u201d Zulum lamented.The governor, represented by Senator Aba Aji, the Secretary of North East Governors Forum, who stated these recently at a public forum in Lagos, added: \u201cThe mainstay of the Northern Nigeria, as you all know is agriculture.\n\nBanks, being the institutions of financial intermediation, are expected to assist agriculture by providing finances to improve production. But inadequate financing has continued to bedevil this important sector and poor banking support for agriculture in Northern Nigeria has created and perpetuated a weak agricultural system in the region. \u201cWhen you go through the length and breadth of Northern Nigeria, you will see rich arable land with vast bodies of water and rivers.\n\nIt all shows that region is blessed with variable minerals such as gold, thyme, bauxite, zinc, limestone, columbite, lead, gypsum and other precious stones. But here, poverty pervades. This is because most of its largely agrarian entrepreneurs who are rural area dwellers could not plug into the formal system due to opportunity barriers created mainly by banks. I, therefore, make a passionate appeal to all bankers to liberalise their lending policies to Northern Nigerian farmers and other entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nA recent report by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on the Depository Corporation Survey report for August 2020 put credit to the economy at N38.67 trillion just as its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed that combined stimulus measures to the economy stood at about US$18 billion, which is close to 4.5 per cent of the GDP.",

          "title": "Banditry: Residents of Abuja suburbs flee",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Molly Kilete and Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja\n\nThe spate of banditry attacks and kidnappings in villages and towns in Abuja sharing boundaries with Niger State have forced most residents to abandon their homes for places they consider safe.\n\nDaily Sun investigation revealed that the most affected towns are Bwari, Kuje and Kubwa where mass exodus of persons have been witnessed recently.\n\nIn Bwari, it was learnt that those who have abandoned their homes cited constant underreported attacks by bandits and frequent abductions of family members by kidnappers as reasons.\n\nResidents of Bwari, who spoke to Daily Sun, said kidnapping is now a regular occurrence, lamenting that streets are now deserted at sunset, over fears that people could be abducted for ransom.\n\nCommunities mostly affected in Bwari are located around the Nigerian Law School, Veritas University and areas bordered by mountains and forests close to Niger State.\n\nSimilarly, in Pegi, a fringe town in Kuje Area Council of Abuja, residents are relocating in droves to the metropolis, as bandits and kidnappers operating in the area have intensified their activities in recent weeks.\n\nThe development in Kuje has forced major schools to shut down. Some of the schools that have shut down are SS Simon & Jude Seminary, Kuje Abuja, Louis Ville Girls, Gwagwalada and Hand Made Girls, Kuje.\n\nResidents living around the mountains in Byazhin, Kubwa, also lament the increase in vices, such as kidnapping and rape. They said strange faces who visit the market from those mountains, occasionally, to buy foodstuffs, are becoming frequent.\n\nThose who spoke with Daily Sun said their environment was no longer safe, as they could no longer go out freely, due to fear of being kidnapped and raped, irrespective of gender.\n\nChioma Okereke, a resident, said that prior to the recent development, it used to be said that kidnappers were after the rich, but lamented that today, it is no longer so, \u201cbecause the hardship in the country has pushed both the thieves and other crime perpetrators to kidnapping because even when they steal, nobody is willing to buy the stolen items.\u201d\n\nFurther investigation revealed that despite the repeated kidnappings by suspected bandits and payment of ransom, the FCT administration, led by the Minister, Muhammad Bello, was yet to summon an emergency meeting with community leaders of the affected areas, on how to address the issue.\n\nIn Kuje, about 37 minutes from the Presidential Villa, residents are not leaving anything to chance. In Pegi, which has become the epicenter of major abductions in Abuja, residents, who are majorly from the southern part of the country, are relocating to the metropolis.\n\nA resident said the place was becoming a ghost town. \u201cThe adjourning road linking the community and Abuja is in a deplorable state. Bandits who operate in a thick forest along the road, lay ambush everyday,\u201d said a resident did not want to be named.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have lived and done business in this area for more than 20 years. I have never experienced the type of fear that we are passing through these days. It is just that it is not easy for one to move with his family to another person\u2019s house. If not, we would have moved.\n\n\u201cThe condition is becoming alarming by the day. These days, we witness influx of strange faces coming to the market to buy foodstuffs, especially during the weekend. We are really scared. Something needs to be done very fast.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Susan Useni, said: \u201cThis country has turned into something else. Before, when you hear of kidnappers, you would say it doesn\u2019t concern you because it was believed to be for the rich; but, today, things have changed. They are now after everyone. This year, almost all my family fruits are wasting in the farm because everyone is afraid.\n\n\u201cThe last group of family members who visited the farmland for harvest ended up paying ransom, depending on what you can afford. Some even paid as small as N10,000. That is to tell you how rampant it has become. Before, you hear religious workers saying they wanted to go up the mountain to pray, but now it is no longer so.\u201d\n\nAminu Alhasan, said they are now after pregnant women and men.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo heavily pregnant women were kidnapped close by here and gang raped. If not for spiritual purpose, how can a normal person settle for another man\u2019s pregnant woman after collecting ransom? Life is no longer safe in this part of the town. On a daily basis, people are kidnapped and money collected quietly.\n\nDespite the fact that Abuja has the nomenclature of a State, the FCT administration has always maintained that the issue of insecurity doesn\u2019t fall within its purview. Instead, it claimed that security agencies, whose headquarters are domiciled in Abuja, should handle the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, there was pandemonium, yesterday, at Karu, a satellite town in Abuja, after commercial motorcycle operators took to the streets to protest the killing of one of their members.\n\nThe protesters set up burn fire, attacked vehicles and passers by.\n\nThe incident, which was said to have started at about 9am saw many Christians trapped in their churches premises until about 2pm when the situation was brought under control.\n\nSoldiers from the Army Headquarters Garrison were drafted to quell the situation which got out of the control of the police.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that trouble started after the Okada riders found the body of one of their colleagues murdered in cold blood and dumped at a valley around the Celestial church and a Muslim cemetery between Nyanya and Karu road.\n\nOn discovering the body, the Okada riders were said to have gathered in their thousands armed with knives, stones, sticks and other dangerous weapons and set burn fire on the major roads, causing heavy gridlock and began to attack innocent persons.\n\nMotorists caught up in the protests were forced to turn back for safety. However, some were not too lucky as they had their wind screens smashed.\n\nOn sighting the police personnel, the protesters were said to have attacked them as more of their members from Mararaba, Masaka, Ado, Nyanya, Jikwoyi and other towns in the area joined their colleagues to attack the police operatives.\n\nIt was gathered that the protest, which started around the Catholic Church in the area, later spread to Jikwoyi, as the protesters were bent on setting the divisional police command there ablaze.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that when the police could no longer handle the crowd, they alerted the military, who immediately deployed soldiers from the Army Headquarters Garrison, to restore law and order.\n\nWhen contacted, the Public Relations Officer for the FCT police command confirmed the report and said the protesters were protesting the killing of one of their members by an unknown gunman.\n\nShe also said the police were working in conjunction with the military were able to restore normalcy. She, however, did not indicate weather or not the police arrested some of the protesters.",

          "text": "\u2022States to set up revenue allocation committees\n\n\u2022New system takes effect 45 days after agreement\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government and governors of the 36 states of the federation have agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nIf the agreement is accepted by judicial and parliamentary workers, who have been on a strike for over one month to press home their demands for financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation, funds from the Federation Account due to each state are to be jointly shared among the executive, legislature and judiciary in each state.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, seeks to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that under the new template, the governors will establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nThe proposal also stipulates that the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) will invoke Executive Order 10 against any state that fails to abide by the terms of the agreement.\n\nA presidency source told THISDAY at the weekend that among the new offers made to the judiciary and legislative workers by the federal and state governments was a reassurance that state governors are committed to implementing full financial autonomy for the two arms of government.\n\n\u201cThey also agreed that they will set up all the structures necessary for the implementation of the financial autonomy, including the budget committee where the judiciaries and state legislatures will forward their expenditure estimates. That will be based on the budget envelope of the projected annual revenue earning for the arms of government as is being done at the federal level,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the source, when the executive, judiciary and legislature prepare their annual budget estimates, they will forward them to the state House of Assembly for consideration and approvals.\n\n\u201cSo when the revenue comes from the federal and the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), the State Fund Allocation Committee will now convene the State Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC), which will now oversee the disbursement of money to different arms of government,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that each state will ensure that it establishes Fund Allocation Committee for its legislature and judiciary to be headed by the head of the courts and the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe two arms of government will also be expected to set up a tenders\u2019 board to be headed by the court registrar and clerk of the state Houses Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the same structure at the federal level would be transposed down to the states.\n\nHe said the same template used by the National Judicial Council (NJC) at the federal level would be adopted in disbursing funds to the judiciary in the states.\n\nHe said under the new arrangement, state Fund Allocation Committee would be headed by the state Commissioner for Finance.\n\nAlso, state Houses of Assembly will be allocated funds in the same manner that the National Assembly receives its allocation after the budget approval.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is a breach on the part of the state government that will trigger off Executive Order 10, which empowers the Accountant-General of the Federation to remit funds directly to the state judicial and legislative arms of government. But if you are doing all that is provided in the proposed template, there will be no need to invoke the Executive Order,\u201d he said.\n\nThe striking judicial and legislative workers had earlier vowed not to compromise on their demands for the implementation of 1999 Constitution as altered.\n\nThe workers said last week at a meeting with a federal government team, led by Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that the issue of financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries was a constitutional provision that did not warrant any negotiation with governors.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN had also insisted that the governors must fully implement financial autonomy for the two arms of government in the 36 states of the federation as guaranteed by the constitution before the strike would be called off.\n\nThe federal government had also pleaded with the unions to consider the efforts being made to resolve the dispute and suspend their strike to enable the court and legislatures to reopen.\n\nNgige had said last week that progress had been made in about 90 per cent of the issues in dispute.\n\nHowever, the meeting between the federal government team and the leadership of the unions had ended with an agreement that the unions should go and study the government\u2019s proposal before the next meeting, billed for tomorrow.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal yesterday indicated that it is considering extending the current equalisation scheme in the petrol supply system in the country to the movement of gas across the country to make the product more available and accessible to Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during an interactive session with energy correspondents in Abuja, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) Management Board, Mr Ahmed Bobboi, noted that when the policy becomes functional, it will help tackle inflation associated with increases in gas products.\n\nPEF\u2019s main function is to ensure price uniformity of petroleum products via the reimbursement of marketers for trucking products to filling stations anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nThe executive secretary stated that the scheme had yet to fully take off because the government was still propagating the use of gas as an alternative fuel and was yet to get its full adoption by the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that 2021 to 2030 had been declared as the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, explaining that a lot of consultations were still ongoing with all relevant agencies to make the proposal become a reality.\n\nBobboi stated that the policy was also awaiting the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) which will clearly spell out the new functions of the PEF, stressing that whatever role is assigned the petrol equalisation board will determine the next line of action on the proposed scheme.\n\n\u201cThis is the (equalisation) scheme that we are trying to extend to gas because the government has declared the decade of gas and we have seen that this has been working for the economy for over 45 years effectively.\n\n\u201cBecause things are much better and if you want to see the benefits, then look at it that in the absence of this scheme what happens to other commodities, the economy, to inflation and then many businesses would have been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s working well for petrol and government wants to promote the use of gas, if we can take the practice to gas, we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain,\u201d Bobboi argued.\n\nHe maintained that when the government extends the practice to the gas sector, it will help many Nigerian homes abandon the use of firewood and reduce deforestation.\n\nAccording to him, it will also eliminate the health hazards associated with the use of high carbon fuels like firewood, especially in rural and remote areas.\n\n\u201cThis will make the product available because we have a lot of gas in the country, it will make it affordable which will incentivise the marketers to take it to the last mile, the consumer will also be incentivised because the marketer will bring down his price. This will do a lot of good to the economy. This is our view,\u201d he noted.\n\nBobboi who took time to break down the continuing relevance of the petrol equalisation fund noted that government was not paying a dime in ensuring parity of petrol price in the country, adding that the consumer pays for it.\n\nThe executive secretary emphasised that \u201cbridging\u201d had become even more relevant because most of the pipelines that were supposed to take the products to many parts of the country had been vandalised.\n\nHe stressed that the original reason for the bridging the policy was to act as a buffer on consumers during turn-around-maintenance, adding that even the existing depots have not been functioning properly.\n\n\u201cThe pipelines have been vandalised, now instead of 30 per cent maximum bridging, it is now about 100 per cent. The cheapest we can have is 98 to 99 per cent because the movement through the pipelines is very low,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Muhammadu Buhari yesterday bemoaned the killings in the country that have worsened the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, condoled with the relatives of those who lost their lives in what he called madness going on nationwide.\n\nThe killings continued at the weekend as bandits murdered no fewer than 11 persons in Katsina and Kaduna States.\n\nAlso, gunmen sustained their attacks on police facilities in the South-east as they hit a police station in Umuahia, Abia State capital.\n\nBuhari, who called for a low-key Eid al-Fitr celebration as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic said: \u201cAs Muslims in Nigeria join others globally in preparations towards Eid al-Fitr, a day that is celebrated to mark the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting, President Buhari has directed that all celebrations are limited due to the global Coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the president, first family, his personal aides, members of the cabinet and service chiefs who choose to remain in Abuja will congregate in full compliance with COVID-19 protocols at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa, Abuja to observe the Eid prayers by 9:00 am.\n\n\u201cThereafter, there will be no traditional Sallah homage to the president by religious, community and political leaders\n\nas was the case last year, the president encouraged such leaders to be content with modest celebrations at home in view of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Islamic clerics and other religious leaders who continue to pray for the wellbeing of the nation and its people.\n\nThe president called on all local leaders to talk to their youths and warn them against being used to incite and foment violence, saying that \u201cif we attack institutions guarding us, who will protect us in future emergencies?\u201d\n\nBandits Kill 11, Injure Three in Kaduna, Katsina\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 11 persons were confirmed killed while three others were injured by bandits in a fresh reprisal by suspected bandits at Tsatskiya community in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State and another separate attack by gunmen in Kaduna.\n\nA retired army sergeant, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed in the Kaduna incident.\n\nThe bandits who attacked Katsina community on Saturday were believed to be avenging a mob action against two of the bandits\u2019 informants who were reportedly killed by some people in the community.\n\nThe bandits, who were said to have invaded the community in the afternoon, also wounded three others who are currently receiving treatment at a Dutsinma town hospital.\n\nResidents confirmed that the bandits were on a reprisal over the recent killing of their informants.\n\nOne of the informants was said to have been killed four days ago in a nearby community called Hakon Kartakawa.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Gambo Isah, a superintendent of police, confirmed the incident yesterday.\n\n\u201cDuring the attack, two people were equally wounded and are still receiving medical attention at Dutsinma General Hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the attack, the residents of Tsatskiya community and other neighbouring villages fled the village to Dutsinma town for safety.\n\nIn another incident, a retired army sergeant, Christopher Madaki, his wife and daughter-in-law were killed by bandits following an attack on Golkofa community, Jama\u2019a Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, his son, Mr. Clement Madaki, was only injured.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, confirmed the killings in a statement yesterday in Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the killings took place on Saturday night when bandits invaded the community.\n\nThe commissioner also said a breakdown of law and order was averted in Kachia town, headquarters of Kachia LGA following the alleged killing of one Hamidu Nura by one Abba Muhammad.\n\nAruwan said the killings in Golkofa were reported to the state government by the Kaduna State Police Command and the Defence Headquarters outfit \u201cOperation Safe Haven.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, gunmen attacked a police station, named after a former Inspector-General (IG), Mr. Mike Okiro, in Umuahia.\n\nThe news of the attack caused pandemonium in the town as churches abruptly ended their services to enable worshippers flee to safety.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state command, Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the incident while speaking with THISDAY on phone.\n\nHe said the attack occurred at 9.45 am, adding that the attackers came in a bus and two Sienna SUVs.\n\nHe stated that a police officer was shot and wounded in the leg during the attack.\n\nAccording to the PPRO, the building was not burnt as the roof did not catch fire when torched.\n\nHowever, he said the hoodlums invaded the

          "title": "el-Rufai\u2019s Allegation of Persecution Unfounded, Says Jonathan",
          "text": "\u2022Accuses gov of becoming bitter after losing vice presidential bid\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan has described the allegation of persecution made against his administration by Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, as a mere figment of his imagination and concocted to attract cheap attention and undeserving popularity.\n\nJonathan, in a statement by his spokesman, Mr. Reno Omokri, said the allegation by el-Rufai that he was to be arrested in furtherance of the second term bid of the former president was untrue.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians may recall that Mr. el-Rufai was on a self-imposed exile during the administration of the late great President Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cMr. el-Rufai only returned to Nigeria on May 5, 2010, the very same day that President Yar\u2019Adua died. He returned because he believed that under then-President Jonathan the atmosphere was more conducive for him. This is borne out by a Wikileaks\u2019 cable, in which Mr. el-Rufai admitted that former President Jonathan is \u2018clean and honest.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter this diplomatic cable was published by local and international media on October 8, 2011, Mr. el-Rufai admitted that he indeed made those comments.\n\n\u201cExactly six days after his return, Mr. el-Rufai visited then President Jonathan at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, on Tuesday, May 11, 2010, and then held a press conference outside the then president\u2019s office, where he made unsolicited comments asking Dr. Jonathan to contest the 2011 elections and said that he would support him.\n\n\u201cAfter the then President named Mr. Namadi Sambo as his vice president, two days later on May 13, 2010, Mr. el-Rufai became very bitter and made plans to leave the Peoples Democratic Party and began to undermine the Jonathan administration.\u201d\n\nThe statement said despite the governor\u2019s anti-government activities, Jonathan declined to move against el-Rufai.\n\nHe said in keeping with the Jonathan doctrine of having no enemy to fight, he refused to move against el-Rufai.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cSecurity reports received by the then president indicated that Mr. el-Rufai was engaged in provocative activities in order to instigate his own arrest, because he felt it would boost his popularity.\n\n\u201cAs such, he made several false and provocative comments that were injurious to Nigeria\u2019s peace, unity and progress, as well as to our good relations with neighbouring nations, including that then-President Jonathan founded and funded Boko Haram to the tune of N50 billion to give Islam a bad name, which Mr. el-Rufai made on September 8, 2014.\n\n\u201cThat then President Jonathan had gone to the Republic of Chad to plan Boko Haram attacks with the late President Deby, which he made on November 25, 2014. And that he el-Rufai, along with [now president] Buhari, and several other prominent Nigerians were on a hit list of people to be shot and killed by the Jonathan administration, which he made on January 5, 2014.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Jonathan resisted the urge to order el-Rufai\u2019s arrest and subsequent prosecution in order not to heighten political tension.\n\nIt said: \u201cMr. Nasir el-Rufai worked closely with then-President Olusegun Obasanjo, who has described him in his book, My Watch Volume 2, as follows: \u2018Nasir\u2019s penchant for reputation savaging is almost pathological. Why does he do it? I recognised his weaknesses; the worst being his inability to be loyal to anybody or any issue consistently for long, but only to Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cHe barefacedly lied which he did to me against his colleagues and so-called friends. I have heard of how he ruthlessly savaged the reputation of his uncle, a man who was like, in the African setting, his foster father. I shuddered when I heard the story of what he did to his half-brother in the Air Force who is senior to him in age.\u2019\n\n\u201cMalam el-Rufai was also exposed as a pathological liar on page 272 of \u2018Power, Politics and Death: A Front-row Account of Nigeria Under the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua,\u2019 written by former THISDAY Editor and spokesman to President Yar\u2019Adua, Mr. Segun Adeniyi.\n\n\u201cFinally, Mr. el-Rufai has been described as \u2018a liar\u2019 and fetish person by his former political patron, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who he credits with bringing him into the Obasanjo administration.\n\n\u201cWith such testimonials about his character from people with initiate knowledge of his personality, Nigerians should not be surprised about Mr. el-Rufai\u2019s most recent assertions.\u201d\n\nHe urged Nigerians to ignore el-Rufai, but to pray for peace, progress and stability of the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Yoruba freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo, otherwise known as Sunday Igboho, has stated that he rained curses on Yoruba elders not supporting the actualisation of the Yoruba nation but he never referred to Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God.\n\nIgboho clarified in a new video on Monday that he did not mock Adeboye and that he was misunderstood, apparently following the backlashes and controversies which his comment on the RCCG General Overseer over the loss of his son, Pastor Dare Adeboye, had generated.\n\nIgboho\n\nIgboho, in the new video, stated that he indeed rained curses on some elders in Yoruba land because they had the power to speak against and do something about the killings and sufferings of the Yoruba people but they failed to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cI cannot pray for evil to happen. I didn\u2019t insult him (Adeboye). I didn\u2019t abuse him. If you watched the video, the matter was not about him. I only mentioned elders who refused to join the cause. How will you have power to help us, and you see our suffering and refuse to act? I am a Christian. God owns us and knows when we will go. Whoever is mocking about death will also die one day. I rained curses on all those elders, I didn\u2019t mention Adeboye.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mock anyone\u2019s death. May God forgive all of us. I don\u2019t know him. He doesn\u2019t know me. Baba (Adeboye) himself watched it and knew I did not abuse him.\u201d\n\nSee Also Politics \"In What Ways Is He Different From Fulani Herdsmen He Is Fighting?\u201d \u2013 Yoruba Youths Fault Igboho Over Comment On Pastor Adeboye\n\nHe stated that he had only asked that religion should not be brought into the discussions about agitations on the Yoruba nation.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported on Sunday that Igboho did not mince words when he rained curses on any leader or pastor who refuse to support the secession agenda, saying God would kill their children and wives.\n\nHe had said this during a live Facebook broadcast with his media aide, Olayomi Koiki, on Saturday night.\n\nKoiki had asked the activist to send some words to Adeboye through the live video, to sympathise with him over the death of his son.\n\nBut Sunday Igboho appeared infuriated by Koiki\u2019s request as he asked if the man of God had declared his support for the Yoruba nation.\n\n\u201cHas Baba (Adeboye) supported Yoruba nation that we will now be greeting him? We don\u2019t need to greet Adeboye. What is my own with that? We are not doing church here. This is not religion.\n\n\u201cPastor Adeboye didn\u2019t speak about Yoruba nation. Look at the number of crowd in Baba Adeboye\u2019s church. Is he not supposed to tell all of them to join Yoruba nation? We don\u2019t need to greet him.\n\n\u201cGod himself will start asking questions from all the enemies of the Yoruba race. By the grace of God, anybody who says Yoruba will not get to the promised land, God will kill their children and wives and their entire family,\u201d he had said.",

          "text": "BY ISRAEL USULOR\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIkenna finally came to and found his head on Mimi\u2019s laps. His brain was fuzzy and he felt his head was too heavy for his neck. Mimi helped him to his feet, her right arm twined around his waist while his left arm clutched her shoulders. He looked around the shadow of what used to be.\n\nZaka City Main Market and was more perplexed by the scary desert of roasted human flesh that greeted his cloudy sight. Human stench punctured his nostrils with the force of an arrow. A bevy of excited vultures hovered above just as flies ululated with perpetual frenzy. Smoke from burning lories clouded the market. The last thing Ikenna remembered was nothing. His body shook ceaselessly as he collapsed again on Mimi\u2019s arms like a log of wood. Mimi slowly sat on the skeletal pieces of what used to be a lorry and held him to her bosom like a nursing mother would when she wants to suckle her baby from her left breast. Soon, Ikenna flipped his eyes open like an infant.\n\n\u2018What happened?\u2019 He asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You collapsed.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019 Ikenna probed further, rising to his feet, this time all by himself.\n\n\u2018The market was bombed by the military. Luckily, I found you in this lorry still breathing,\u2019 said Mimi, wiping her misty eyes with the back of her left hand. Ikenna\u2019s brain suddenly rewound like a video tape. He hopped off the rickety lorry and wobbled through the logs of roasted bodies towards Oduburu\u2019s shop. At the front of what used to be the ceramic shop, Ikenna stood hands akimbo. The shop was reduced to rubbles. Chunks of human flesh got mixed with broken ceramics. Ikenna looked searchingly in the faces of coaled bodies that littered the whole place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I hope Oga Oduburu and Akubundu escaped alive,\u2019 he wondered, throwing his hands in the air.\n\n\u2018Look here!\u2019 shouted Mimi, pointing Ikenna\u2019s attention to particular charred remains. It was burnt beyond recognition, but a pair of shoes still hung on its skeletal legs. Ikenna recognized the shoes.\n\n\u2018Chei! Chei! Aru emee!\u2019 Ikenna exclaimed.\n\n\u2018This is Oga Oduburu\u2019s body,\u2019 he said, squatting. He saw a fez cap beside him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think this cap belonged to Akubundu,\u2019 he said as he lifted the cap and held it up to Mimi.\n\n\u2018Yes! I saw him wearing that cap when I came earlier,\u2019 Mimi agreed.\n\n\u2018So the two of them are gone?\u2019 Ikenna asked rhetorically. Hot tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nMimi drew closer to him and held him up with both hands. She pressed his head to her bosom and stroked it with her right hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry love,\u2019 Mimi said. It was the first time Mimi was referring to Ikenna as \u201clove.\u201d\n\n\u2018I know how difficult this must be for you. I was in this position when my father was killed some years ago. And right now, I don\u2019t even know my mother\u2019s whereabouts, or if she is dead or alive.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure she is dead\u2019 she said as tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n\u201cWe must hasten to leave this place immediately. I don\u2019t want to die now. I want to live and take care of our baby.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIkenna\u2019s face brightened. He looked up to Mimi as he struggled to put up a false smile.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t agree less. We must both live for our child. You are the best thing that happened to me in this city. I\u2019m so sorry for my reaction to the news earlier when you told me about the pregnancy. I didn\u2019t know what to do. But after the experience I had today, I now know we have only one life to live and that we must make every moment count, no matter how daunting or bleak it might seem. I have realized that at some point in ones\u2019 life, one has to stand up and take responsibility of one\u2019s actions. I love you Mimi\u2019\n\n\u2018I love you too Ikenna,\u2019 she said, in a tender tone.\n\nThe strange spirit of love possessed them in their moment of sorrow. It was the game-changer. Of course, at that moment, Ikenna felt differently about Mimi and the pregnancy and thought the right thing to do was to take responsibility of the consequences of his actions. There was no more guilt in his heart. He looked intently in her eyes as if he would see the baby in them. Their hands were clasped and their winged spirits walked in unison, ready for an adventurous flight into the unmapped space of love.\n\nSuddenly, Ikenna\u2019s face changed. He looked away from Mimi and stared into space as if the sounds of gunshots at the background reminded him of a thing.\n\n\u2018What is it my love,\u2019 Mimi asked.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go and look for your mother and Oga Oduburu\u2019s wife,\u2019 he said, grabbing Mimi\u2019s hand and running with it.\n\n\u2018But they must be dead by now. Let\u2019s just run away, it\u2019s not safe out there!\u2019 Said Mimi, panting.\n\n\u2018No! There is a chance they might still be alive.\u2019 They ran out of the market into the deserted road. They sprinted to the apartment where the Oduburus stayed. The gate was ajar and the compound was a graveyard. The first thing that greeted Ikenna and Mimi was the lifeless body of a disemboweled Adaugo. She was heavily pregnant and was obviously due. Her baby was unwombed and placed on her chest. The baby boy was stabbed twice on its neck and his blood dripped and mixed with that of its mother. Mimi threw up on Ikenna who still clutched her by the hand. Ikenna knelt down solemnly as a flood of tears ceaselessly washed his cheeks. He touched the baby with his left hand and noticed there was no movement. Mimi had turned away from the sight. It nauseated her. It was the most callous thing she had ever seen. She placed her palms on her belly and massaged it as if to make sure her own baby was still there. Ikenna held her by the hand and led her out of the compound. It was one of those sights that ties the tongue and renders it speechless. Darkness was encroaching and the gunshots had not ceased as bullets still flew around like shooting stars. On Mimi\u2019s insistence, they walked into the bush and took cover without going to look for her mother.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll kill myself if I see my mother\u2019s corpse,\u2019 she had said. Ikenna obliged.\n\nRead part ten HERE\n\nIsrael Usulor is a journalist and short story writer. You can reach him via @JonalistIsrael and [email protected]\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

Instead, they want to be the backbone on which insurers depend for efficiency. Insurance from Pula and OKO target farmers, differentiating from the pack of health management organisations whose domain is health insurance.\n\nInsurance is a tough business to sell in poor communities as people prioritise present needs over saving against future loss. That poses challenging questions about the business model of insurance in Africa.\n\nInsurance industry respondents to the Catalyst Fund and Briter Bridges survey said commissions are how they make money. That is also how those in the credit business make money. It would seem then that insurers can learn some tricks from credit businesses to know what levers to pull for insurance to be more appealing and adopted by customers.\n\nA lot of the buzz about digital lending is in using data to provide tailored customer products and services. If well deployed, big data and analysis could be the pillar that boosts insurance in Africa, activating a market potential estimated to be up to $68 billion by McKinsey.\n\n\n\nThe investor and startup communities seem to think this future is achievable, a signal that we could yet see more investments into the insurance sector in the latter months of 2021.",

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "text": "Following its official launch, the new Learn at Home audio e-learning platform will provide free, online, and unlimited learning access to more than 100 million Nigerian youths.\n\nThis first-of-its-kind audio e-learning platform will offer unlimited access based on the national mobile phone penetration, low-data, and basic featurephone requirements. The platform is a continuum of Data Science Nigeria\u2019s successful \u2018LearnatHome\u2019 initiative, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, that provided learning to millions of Nigerian pupils amid the COVID-19 disruptive restrictions. Learn at Home is based on an inclusive e-learning approach. It is designed to eliminate the barriers of internet access (data) cost and over-dependency on expensive smartphones in the delivery of locally relevant, convenient, and inexpensive access to quality education.\n\nThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative, www.learnathome.radio is part of an extensive effort to reduce the urban-rural learning disparities in Nigeria.\n\nMastercard Foundation says it is a continuation of efforts to ensure universal learning and improve learning outcomes across all communities in Nigeria. Already, more than 4 million students have joined audio classes with USSD/SMS support, where they receive educational materials on key subjects, based on the Nigerian Educational Research and Development (NERDC) curriculum for primary and secondary school students. \u201cThe disruption of the pandemic did not only halt learning for many, but also revealed and exacerbated existing inequalities in learning opportunities. The purpose of www.learnathome.radio is to ensure children have equal, convenient, and affordable access to quality learning,\u201d said, Chidinma Lawanson, Country Head, Mastercard Foundation Nigeria.\n\nOn the platform, pupils and students from primary 1 to Senior Secondary (SS3) will gain access to a special examination readiness series that includes a collection of solved past questions in WAEC, NECO, BECE, and Common Entrance from 2009 to 2020. Expert teachers have been engaged to provide answers and explanations to the past questions in a step-by-step and easy-to-understand format, with complementary live classes that enable each student to learn at a preferred pace irrespective of location and socioeconomic conditions.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, Toyin Adekanmbi, the Executive Director of Data Science Nigeria, described it as \u201ca creative and innovative approach to democratize learning in Nigeria and provide an effective solution to the challenge of unequal distribution of learning and education opportunities in rural and urban communities.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cThe Learn at Home audio e-learning initiative will build on the clear successes we recorded in the quest to ensure ongoing learning for children during the pandemic restrictions, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, through our audio classes in several cities in Nigeria. It is specifically designed for smooth functionality on basic feature phones operating on the EDGE or 2G network and low data. For MTN users, it is absolutely free. With this, children in rural and remote communities can learn from the highest quality teachers at their own pace and prepare for important examinations with the best resources and educational aids developed based on the approved curriculum.\u201d\n\nBesides the examination preparation series, www.learnathome.radio features a wide variety of content, including amazing global facts, inspirational quotes, current affairs, common errors in the English language, and much more. Mr. Nwachukwu, one of the parents, already taking advantage of the platform, praised it as a breakthrough innovation. \u201cBefore, platforms like this one, were usually only for those who could afford expensive laptops or smartphones and daily internet subscriptions. Now, every child, everywhere can learn.\u201d\n\nEnds.\n\nAbout Data Science Nigeria\n\nData Science Nigeria is a registered non-profit organization, run and managed by the Data Scientists Network Foundation, with a vision to build a world-class Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, research and innovation ecosystem that delivers high-impact transformational research, business use applications, AI-first start-ups, support employability and social good use cases.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nVesti Technologies Inc announces the availability of its Vesti app both on IOS and Google play store. The Vesti app is a financial solution that provides peer-to-peer payments and migration-related fees settlement for Africans and gives a support structure for immigrants in accessing investment opportunities. Also, for migrants seeking opportunities to move to Europe and North America for work and study, the Vesti app allows them to receive money, transfer money, and make international payments through the app.\n\nIn 2019 alone, more than 12,000 students from Nigeria traveled to the United States for advanced degrees and paid an estimated $4.2Million in Student Exchange fees to the US government. Payments like SEVIS require international students to have a person present in the US to make payment, resulting in difficulties and delays during this process. It is these challenges and experiences by migrants that led to the development of the Vesti app.\n\nAccording to Abimbola Amusan, the co-founder \u2013 Vesti Technologies Inc, said that \u201cWe developed the Vesti app to support more than 20 million young people in Africa and other countries of the world, who have aspirations to migrate to developed countries, and potentially will have challenges in accessing the needed financial services for skilled migration opportunities to North America, Europe, and Australia by 2025.\u201d He further reiterated that \u201d We see a high growth platform with thousands of downloads pre-launch, and hundreds of thousands of users within a few months. Vesti app users can transfer money, pay for services, save, invest, and earn. In the future, we want to be the migrants\u2019 bank, the first bank account the migrant opens and their lens to see the world\u201d. He ended.\n\nThrough the Vesti app, the following service is accessible by a click of a button:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend and receive money using an in-app wallet,\n\nCommence a relocation specific savings plan or any other savings goal,\n\nMake payment for WES or SEVIS fee directly.\n\nAccess webinars content, download migration-related resources, and get access to migration-related learning.\n\nTuition payment for a student on the app in local currency and\n\nOpportunities for short-term investment to raise migration-related financing.\n\nAdding his voice on the need for the development of the Vesti app, Olusola Amusan co-founder of Vesti Technologies Inc, sighted the United Nations Office on Migration estimates the global migration industry is at $650Billion annually, and the Vesti app would help ensure migrants seamless scale the hurdle of financial challenges. He emphasized that \u201cWe built an app for people all over the world, who desire to move to new countries for study or work and those who are seeking permanent migration to find the services and payment infrastructure that makes their journey less tedious.\u201d\n\nAs part of the ideation phase of the Vesti app, several months earlier, series of webinars to educate thousands of people on skilled migration were held concurrently. Sessions on the webinar had a minimum of 3,000 participants per time, and engagement and conversations with these participants gave rise to insights and potential challenges migrants face on financial payments.\n\nBased on these insights gathered and the personal experiences of the founders, the Vesti app birthed. Abimbola, a US-trained Lawyer working in Immigration Law, while Olusola is known more for being an AI evangelist and more recently a skilled migration evangelist, who was once Microsoft Nigeria Philanthropies Lead before venturing to start Coven Works. He has led notable software projects as a senior architect and engineering manager. Olusola left Nigeria and moved to the United States of America in 2019 and has since been providing advisory services to an estimated 7,000 people who intend to seek foreign education or legally immigrate to a new country.\n\nTheir journey from Nigeria to the United States, for both Abimbola and Olusola, describes how tedious it is to make payments for international fees associated with migration. They saw a gap in the market and developed the Vesti app to help mitigate it. They first encountered this when both co-founders experienced this challenge when they participated in the Peace Tech Accelerator in Washington D.C. At that time, they were building Coven Works, an AI-focused skilling and recruiting startup, and they didn\u2019t know they were going to move to the United States.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nDebt can be a big hindrance in reaching your financial goals this year. It can wreak havoc in your personal life too, as you can be miserable when you struggle to make debt repayments. Getting out of debt is not that easy. You might have to use all your income every month and nothing will be left for an emergency fund. Becoming debt-free needs commitment, discipline, and motivation. Luckily, there are many ways to get out of debt and still build a nest egg for a rainy day. We have prepared a Pag-IBIG loan guide so as not to sit in a puddle of agreement. Read it too, very carefully\n\nNo more debts for now\n\nDebt is not always a bad thing. The determining factor is how, when, or where you use it. One good thing is if you borrow money to finance investments, that can result in higher balances than investments that come entirely from cash. But when debt becomes a burden, then it is time to stop piling up your debt. This means no more asking for loans in the meantime until you have wiped out your slate clean. This gives you the chance to start all over again.\n\nTry freezing all your non-essential spending for three months. If you have a problem with credit cards then cut them up or put them away. One way to avoid paying with your credit card is not to bring it with you every time you go out of the house. Just bring cash good enough to buy your essentials. When you pay in cash, you are physically aware of what you have to give out, thus it serves as a deterrent to spending unnecessarily.\n\nList all your debts\n\nMake a catalog. Go over all your receipts, statements of account, and bills. This may be an arduous job to do but you have to have a clear picture of your debt position. Many people are uncomfortable with their debt issues, but you need to face up and deal with it no matter how difficult it may seem. Once the complete listing is over, you can now embark on debt payment strategies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive leaner\n\nClassify your payables into needs, wants, and debt repayments. Write down your monthly bills such as rent, telephone, other utilities, and debt payments. This is the time to stop buying luxuries and indulging in vices. Sacrifice is the key, so monies for wants will be freed up for debt repayments. Always set aside for your savings no matter how small it is.\n\nFour methods for your debt repayment\n\nThere is no one strategy when you want to pay your debt. There are several methods of debt repayment.\n\n1. Researchers for the Harvard Business Review found that the snowball method proved to be the most effective strategy. This method prioritizes your smallest debt first, regardless of the interest rate. Try listing all of your debts from the smallest to the largest, then pay the minimum balance on each debt, except the smallest debt. For the smallest one, try to pay as much cash as possible each month until it is fully repaid then move on to the second smallest debt. The idea here is to see your debts disappear one at a time. Focusing on paying the account with the smallest balance will give you a sense of progress. It will give you a push or energy, therefore, encouraging you to continue paying until you reach your goal.\n\n2. There are other methods too if you want to look at them. The debt snowflake method is making one-time payments whenever you can, so whatever amount you put toward your debt will eventually accumulate in time.\n\n3. In the snow shovel method, you look for other sources of income if you cannot pay the minimum amount payable for your loan.\n\n4. The debt avalanche method is done by getting rid of your debt by paying the one with the highest interest rates first. Thus, you pay your minimum monthly payments on all your debts but pay extra toward the debt with the highest interest until it is gone.\n\nAfter you decide on which method to use, start paying your debt now. Keep it up until you are debt-free. But if you need emergency cash now, go to Robocash website. Robocash can help you with your financial needs provided that you are a Filipino citizen, 21 to 70 years of age, and employed or in a certain profession. All you have to do is register and provide a valid government ID and a mobile number that is not blocked.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nGet your story featured on Techpoint.

When you pay in cash, you are physically aware of what you have to give out, thus it serves as a deterrent to spending unnecessarily.\n\nList all your debts\n\nMake a catalog. Go over all your receipts, statements of account, and bills. This may be an arduous job to do but you have to have a clear picture of your debt position. Many people are uncomfortable with their debt issues, but you need to face up and deal with it no matter how difficult it may seem. Once the complete listing is over, you can now embark on debt payment strategies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive leaner\n\nClassify your payables into needs, wants, and debt repayments. Write down your monthly bills such as rent, telephone, other utilities, and debt payments. This is the time to stop buying luxuries and indulging in vices. Sacrifice is the key, so monies for wants will be freed up for debt repayments. Always set aside for your savings no matter how small it is.\n\nFour methods for your debt repayment\n\nThere is no one strategy when you want to pay your debt. There are several methods of debt repayment.\n\n1. Researchers for the Harvard Business Review found that the snowball method proved to be the most effective strategy. This method prioritizes your smallest debt first, regardless of the interest rate. Try listing all of your debts from the smallest to the largest, then pay the minimum balance on each debt, except the smallest debt. For the smallest one, try to pay as much cash as possible each month until it is fully repaid then move on to the second smallest debt. The idea here is to see your debts disappear one at a time. Focusing on paying the account with the smallest balance will give you a sense of progress. It will give you a push or energy, therefore, encouraging you to continue paying until you reach your goal.\n\n2. There are other methods too if you want to look at them. The debt snowflake method is making one-time payments whenever you can, so whatever amount you put toward your debt will eventually accumulate in time.\n\n3. In the snow shovel method, you look for other sources of income if you cannot pay the minimum amount payable for your loan.\n\n4. The debt avalanche method is done by getting rid of your debt by paying the one with the highest interest rates first. Thus, you pay your minimum monthly payments on all your debts but pay extra toward the debt with the highest interest until it is gone.\n\nAfter you decide on which method to use, start paying your debt now. Keep it up until you are debt-free. But if you need emergency cash now, go to Robocash website. Robocash can help you with your financial needs provided that you are a Filipino citizen, 21 to 70 years of age, and employed or in a certain profession.

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe rumour making the rounds that Union Bank Plc may soon be acquired by either Zenith Bank Plc or Access Bank Plc may have been driven by everything but weak balance sheet.\n\nWhile it is not unlikely that such scheming may be seriously going on outside the views of the discerning public, the first quarter result of Union Bank is not anywhere below industry expectation.\n\nThe lender last week disclosed that its profit before tax (PBT) rose by 12 per cent to N6.9bn as of the end of the first quarter of 2021 from N6.2bn in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nA statement titled \u2018Group unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2021\u2019 on Thursday said that was driven by higher non-interest income and lower operating expenses.\n\nHighlights of the statement said its gross earnings was down by 15 per cent to N36.4bn in the period under review from N42.6bn in Q1, 2020, due to lower interest environment in the Nigeria financial sector.\n\nThe statement said net operating income after impairments was relatively flat at N24.3bn in Q1, 2021 from N24.2bn in Q1 2020; while non-interest income rose by 10 per cent to N14.1bn from N12.9bn in Q1 2020, driven by successful debt recovery efforts.\n\nUnion Bank said its operating expenses fell by four per cent to N17.3bn from N18bn in Q1, 2020, an outcome of sustained cost optimisation efforts; while non-performing loans ratio was flat at four per cent.\n\nCommenting on the results, the Chief Executive Officer, EmekaOkonkwo, said, \u201cI am pleased to be able to provide the first set of quarterly results under my tenure as CEO following a smooth transition in leadership.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenging economic climate, our bank has maintained a steady performance that we can build on for the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cThe bank has responded well to the challenges in the market since the onset of the pandemic. Our overall efforts in Q1 delivered a 12 per cent growth in PBT.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly pleased with the consistent growth we are seeing in transaction volumes which validates our digital-led strategy and is delivering returns. By prioritisingpersonalised solutions and enabling self-service, we are attracting transaction-backed deposits and enhancing customer knowledge to better manage risk.\u201d\n\nHe said its performance was also supported by strong debt recovery efforts which contributed to growth in non-interest income, enabling it to maintain net operating income at N24.3bn despite the significant reductions on net interest margins across the industry since Q1 2020.\n\nThe tier 1 bank held its 52thAnnual General Meeting (AGM) where its shareholders approved the Group\u2019s 2020 annual accounts presented by the Board Chair, Mrs. Beatrice HamzaBassey.\n\nThe shareholders whose attendance at the AGM was by proxy, owing to public health safety directives on public and mass gatherings due to the sustained COVID-19 threat, approved the recommended dividend of 25 Kobo per 50 Kobo ordinary share, while applauding the bank\u2019s resilience in these times, and its focus on sustaining shareholder value.\n\nIn her remarks, Mrs. HamzaBassey highlighted key achievements of the Bank in 2020 including the continued focus on digital innovation for high-quality service delivery across touch points; the bank\u2019s multipronged approach to supporting the fight against COVID-19, and the prompt pivot to remote work for over 70% of employees at the height of the pandemic, owing to strategic investments in digital technologies prior to the pandemic.\n\nShe said:\u201cOur commitment to delivering high quality earnings remains unwavering. I am pleased to announce that the Bank delivered a resilient set of results in 2020 notwithstanding the challenging macroeconomic operating environment.\n\n\u201cOur overall performance demonstrates our resilience and ability to adapt to the constantly changing business environment to maximise shareholder returns. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders as we continue to drive growth and pro\ufb01tability of our business.\u201d\n\nMajor highlights of the Bank\u2019s financial performance in 2020 show that profit before tax grew by 2.8% to \u20a625.4 billion, from \u20a624.7 billion in 2019. Customer deposits also increased by 27.6% to \u20a61,131.1 billion compared to \u20a6886.3 billion in 2019, reflecting the Bank\u2019s agility in delivering a compelling range of products to its customers during the pandemic, and increased adoption of digital channels. In addition, Non-performing loans ratio reduced to 4% from 5.8% in 2019, driven by a disciplined recoveries strategy, a more robust loan book and key restructurings to support customers during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on the bank\u2019s performance for 2020 and plans for 2021, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. EmekaOkonkwo said:\n\n\u201cIn 2020, despite the headwinds caused by the pandemic, Union Bank continued to deliver a strong performance that has enabled the Board of Directors propose a dividend payment for the second consecutive year. This indicates resilience and affirms the strong foundation that was rebuilt over the past eight years.\n\n\u201cAs we begin a new chapter, we will continue the journey to becoming a leading financial institution in Nigeria. Sustaining value to our shareholders remains at the core of our continuous drive and we remain committed to delivering improved profitability and higher returns in 2021 and beyond.\u201d",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere are indications that the naira 4 dollar Scheme of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is showing signs of yielding the expected results, prompting expectations that the recent gains recorded by the local currencymay be sustained.\n\nThe apex bank had on Wednesday announced the indefinite extension of the promo deadline through a statement it issued to all deposit money banks (DMBs), International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO), and the general public.\n\nAlthough the bank did not give a reason for its action, the move is expected to further boost the country\u2019s foreign reserve and increase dollar circulation.\n\n\u201cFurther to the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/PUB/FPC/01/003 dated 05 March 2021 on the above subject matter, which was originally scheduled to end on 08 May 2021, we hereby announce the continuation of the scheme till further notice,\u201d the memo said.\n\n\u201cAll aspects of the operationalization of the programme remain the same. Please take note and ensure compliance.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo increase the inflows of diaspora remittances into the country, the bank had in March launched the scheme that pays naira to senders and recipients of international money transfers.\n\nSince the crash of oil price last year amid COVID-19 pandemic, the naira has struggled against the dollar as the country has witnessed reduced foreign exchange.\n\nFirst gain in two weeks at parallel,official markets\n\nThe naira gained significantly against the U.S. dollar at the unofficial market on Friday, data posted on abokiFX.com, a website that collates parallel market rates in Lagos showed.\n\nThe data showed that the naira closed at N483.00 at the black market, a 0.41 per cent appreciation on N485.00, which it stood since April 22.The last time the currency touched below N483.00 at the parallel market was on April 19 when it exchanged hands with the greenback at N482.00.\n\nIn a similar manner, the local unit strengthened marginally against the U.S dollar at the I&E window of the foreign exchange market on Friday as foreign exchange supply soared significantly.\n\nData posted on the FMDQ Security Exchange window where forex is officially traded showed that naira closed at N410.33 at the trading session of the NAFEX window on Friday, a performance representing N0.67 or 0.16 per cent appreciation from N411.00, the rate it traded in the previous session on Thursday.\n\nThis occurred as foreign exchange supply rose significantly. The forex turnover skyrocketed by 37.78 per cent, with $146.52 million recorded as against the $106.34 million posted in the previous session on Thursday.The naira saw an intraday high of N400.00 and a low of N437.41 before closing at N410.33 on Friday.The last time the currency (naira) closed at N410.00 and above was on April 26.\n\n\u201cThe CBN naira for dollar policy is apt, but it\u2019s too early to attribute any appreciation in naira value to it\u201d, Christian Ike, an economist told our correspondent in a chat.\n\n\u201cIt is also good to how sustainable the seeming effect will be before any conclusion is arrived at,\u201d\n\nA financial analyst, Dr. Silas Peters, commended the CBN for the recent policies aimed at boosting foreign exchange inflow into the country but urged the fiscal authorities to complement the apex bank\u2019s efforts by creating enabling environment for foreign direct investments.\n\n\u201cThe CBN is making commendable efforts, but it cannot do it alone without the support of fiscal authorities\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cRelying on diaspora remittances alone is not enough. We must pursue a boost in FDI for our foreign exchange crisis to be addressed. \u201c\n\nFX liquidity crisis\n\nRising dollar demand has been putting pressure on the naira, as importers with obligations scramble for hard currency, while providers of foreign exchange (foreign investors), have exited after the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered oil price crash.\n\nData from the CBN as at Monday (March 8) showed that Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange reserves declined 3.93 percent year-on-year to $34.91 billion by March 3, compared with $36.24 billion a year ago. Also, the data showed that the nation\u2019s forex buffer declined 2.04 percent year-to-date from $35.64 billion recorded on January 4, 2021.\n\nLittle wonder the CBN in a bid to manage the exchange rate and improve liquidity in the foreign exchange market, has been introducing forex policies targeted at curtailing demand and improving liquidity.\n\nNigeria hopes to attract more remittances from its diaspora to boost foreign currency liquidity, with the \u2018Naira for Dollar\u2019 scheme being the latest policy introduced by the CBN to promote diaspora remittances. The incentive scheme enables the CBN to reward senders and recipients of International Money Transfers (IMT).\n\nAccording to a CBN circular, the programme, which, until the extension, was to runs from March 8 till May 8, creates room for recipients to get 5 naira for every $1 they remit through licensed international money transfer operators (IMTO) and commercial banks.\n\nThe CBN governor Godwin Emefiele had explained that reducing the cost of sending remittances is a significant way to boost remittance inflows to Nigeria. According to him, the new policy is expected to enlarge the scope and scale of foreign exchange inflows into the country with a view to stabilizing the exchange rate and supporting accretion to external reserves.\n\nThe apex bank had taken the first bold step to boost foreign currency liquidity in December when it lifted rules that had restricted inflows in a new diaspora remittances policy.\n\nThe policy which took effect from December 4 (2020), allows diaspora remittances to be paid in cash in U.S. dollars or into a domiciliary (foreign-currency) account at market rates. In the past, remittances could be paid in naira and the CBN had restricted domiciliary account usage.\n\nNigeria is the world\u2019s fifth-biggest destination for international remittances, with five million of her citizens living abroad sending money back to relatives, according to Western Union. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that diaspora flows into Nigeria totalled $23.63 billion in 2018, representing 6.1% of GDP.",

          "title": "Lagos State set for electricity market, to distribute own power to residents",
          "text": "By Adebayo Obajemu\n\nWith the worsening power situation in the country, Lagos, the commercial hub of the country has suffered disproportionately, especially given the fact that the state consumes a third of the power output in the country. It was this concern to improve the power needs of the state that led to the Enron power project under the government of Bola Tinubu in 2002.\n\nAlthough the effort fell through, the government has continued to adopt different stragies to increase the electricity generation in the state. During former governor Babatunde Fashola regime, the state embarked on massive power plant development which lit up Lagos, and restored social life.\n\nCurrently plans are in the pipeline for Lagos State Government to set up a state -owned electricity generation, transmission and distribution company to provide power for the over 20 million residents.\n\nThe detail of the plan was contained in the Lagos State Electricity Policy Consultation Paper signed recently by Engr. Olalere Odusote, Commissioner of Energy and Minerals resources. Many Lagosians and businesses have canvassed for independent power for Lagos given its position and place as the economic nerve centre of the country.\n\nDr. Mohammed Abubakar of the department of economics, Ahmadu Bello University told Business Hallmark that \u201cthere is no megacity in the world of the same size and economic stature as Lagos that does not have its own power; it is ridiculous and a failure of leadership.\u201d\n\nOn the rationale behind the new initiative, the government stated that Lagos is the most important city in Nigeria, apart from its melting point position, it\u2019s the commercial and business life wire of the nation, and thus in need of Independent power.\n\nAccording to the government, this would be the state\u2019s single biggest infrastructural and developmental challenge is power. The state, according to the document, depends entirely on Nigeria\u2019s national grid for its public electricity supply.\n\nIt added that the two resident electricity distribution companies (Discos) \u2013 Eko and Ikeja \u2013 currently receive just about 1000mw from the national grid, for an average of no more than 12 hours daily, i.e., 12,000 megawatt-hours (MWh), for a population exceeding 27 million spread over a comparatively compact land mass.\n\nThe Babajide Sanwoolu administration stated that since the national grid supply was uneven and no more than half a day on average across the state; many of the residents have opted for alternative, self-generated electricity to drive their socio-economic activities despite its significant cost and environmental hazards.\n\nThe document revealed that the State\u2019s Electricity Board (LSEB) conducted some research a few years ago, which demonstrated that 15,000mw of the estimated 45,000mw of alternative power supply in Nigeria was located within Lagos State alone.\n\nWith the daily energy need of 45,000 mw, the government argued that the state cannot continue to rely on the national grid alone for a sustainable, long term, socio-economic growth and significant growth of its citizens\u2019 standard of living.\n\nThe government further affirmed that due to the continuous flow of new residential, commercial and industrial developments and investments (Lekki Free Trade Zone, the Dangote Refinery, Eko Atlantic Project, numerous housing schemes and estates and single unit homes being built), the State needed to establish the enabling environment for a unique electricity market that is separate from (or off) the national electricity grid, which is also connected with the latter.\n\nThe document also identified efforts of successive administrations of state to tackle the electricity supply challenge, but not with enough success to keep up with its urban growth and the demand that follows such growth.\n\nTwenty years ago, the government proposed the Enron power barges in return for dedication of part of the output to Lagos Industries. Ten years later, the state promoted five Integrated Power Plants (IPPs) across the state to serve public assets and infrastructure.\n\nReferencing the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) economic review, the document revealed that manufacturers in Lagos which contributes 29.6% of the state\u2019s GDP, experience a daily average of six power outages, with only about four hours of electricity. It stated that the reason for this capacity underutilization was not the absence of markets but the poor supply of electricity to the state.\n\nThe state\u2019s fast-growing megacity is likely to double its population within the next 30 years, and can not solely depend for its electricity supply on an unreliable 6000mw national grid. It is, therefore under pressure to chart a supplementary or complementary course in seeking energy reliability for its citizens.\n\nThe document highlighted critical requirements needed for implementation of the holistic solution that delivers clean, adequate and reliable electricity supply within the geographical territory of the state and to all its demographic/customer classes, to include, enabling constitutional and legal framework; and integrated resource plan.\n\nOthers are autonomous, credible regulatory body; competitive and transparent procurement of generation resources; a bankable commercial framework; independent system operator; well-funded, well-managed generation, transmission and distribution players; and collaborative Federal and State Governments\u2019 support for market growth/customer satisfaction.\n\nThe government however, noted that it is not unaware of the legal, engineering and commercial frameworks required to create a viable sub-national electricity sector that is entirely off-the-national-grid but nevertheless caters fully to the needs of its citizens. It was on the basis of this that the state assembly enacted the extant Lagos State Power Sector Reform Law of 2018.\n\nThat law was intended to provide a basis for significant private sector investment in the fledgling Lagos electricity market. It also provided for the Lagos State Electricity Board to take responsibility for driving \u201crural electrification\u201d (a term whose definition is still imprecise).\n\nEvidently, in spite of the presence of all the elements \u2013 constitutional/legal, engineering, commercial and financial \u2013 necessary to establish electricity market for the State, the law does not quite do enough to advance the state towards this vital strategic goal.\n\nThe state has therefore structured the legal framework, identified its strategic objectives, key stakeholders and players, market structures, delivery methods and a regulatory framework for market development/ operations and consumer protection.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe consultation paper is expected to seek a holistic solution to the State\u2019s electricity supply challenges, in view of the continuous flow of new developments and investment in the state including, Lekki Free Trade Zone, a new airport, the Dangote refinery complex, the Eko Atlantic project, numerous new residential areas and housing schemes, as well as the tendency for urban planning to lag behind residential expansion.\n\n\u201cOur strategic objective in Lagos State must be to build an electricity system that enables our collective prosperity and customer satisfaction in an environment that fosters the innovation, easy adoption of current and future technologies.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve electricity sufficiency and reliability; we realise that electricity, as a manufactured commodity, is best provided commercially, that is, within an organised, orderly market, by private sector players; recognising always that there must be special focus on providing the same universal access to the vulnerable and disadvantaged populations at the base of the societal pyramid.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the Enabling Constitutional/Legal Framework that can legalise the establishment of a viable, State-focused electricity system the document noted that such a framework must be situated under the 1999 Constitution.\n\nIt said, \u201c the State Government takes its bearings from Section 14 of the Concurrent Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution as the foundation for creating a proper legal and commercial framework for a Lagos-centric electricity market. Section 14 provides: \u201d A House of Assembly may make laws for the State with respect to:\n\n(a)electricity and the establishment in that State of electric power stations;\n\n(b) (b) the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to areas not covered by a national grid system within that State;\n\n(c) and (c) the establishment within that State of any authority for the promotion and management of electric power stations established by the State.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that Section 13 of the Concurrent Legislative List, which sets out the ambit of the Federal Government\u2019s powers does not specifically mention \u201cdistribution\u201d as a sector for which the National Assembly may make laws, similar to the specific inclusion of \u201cgeneration\u201d and \u201ctransmission\u201d therein.\n\n\u201c We take this to mean that the \u201celectricity\u201d sector is peculiarly left to local and sub-national entities to manage, which accords both with engineering sense and the constitutional/legal practice in large federal jurisdictions like Nigeria, such as the United States and India.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Section 14 of the Concurrent Legislative List requires the interepretation of a number of key words and phrases. First, we read \u201celectricity\u201d in Section 14(a) as a general word or matter that is disjunctive from \u201cthe establishment in that State of electric power stations\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the State Government proposes to enact a comprehensive law with respect to \u201celectricity\u201d in the State. This is all the more so taking into account the literal meaning of Sections 16(1)(d), 16(2)(b) and 16(2)(c) of the 1999 Constitution and the fact that electricity is itself a matter on the Concurrent Legislative List.\n\n\u201cThese three provisions, we believe, make it clear that \u201celectricity\u201d is not a \u201cmajor sector of the economy\u201d such as would preclude State Governments from making comprehensive laws for the provision of electricity within the boundaries of their respective States.\n\n\u201cThe earlier-noted point that \u201cdistribution\u201d is not mentioned in Section 13 emphasises this point. Second, is the question whether Lagos State is \u201ccovered by a national grid system\u201d within the context and expectations of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf covered and its derivative, \u201ccoverage\u201d, are defined as mere presence of electricity wires in the State, then Lagos is covered. On the other hand, however, if we consider that the national grid delivers daily average capacity of less than 1000MW to the entire population of Lagos State and all its commercial, industrial and human residents, as compared to the alternative backup capacity resident within the State (at least 15 times what the national grid delivers) then this coverage must be seen as so grossly inadequate that it in socio-economic terms, it is almost non-existent.\n\n\u201cThe State Government is convinced that the constitutional requirement or expectation that the national grid system will \u201ccover\u201d all areas, and therefore, all residents of Lagos State, has not been met.\n\n\u201cThe national grid system has historically, particularly since 1999, not being capable of supporting Lagos State and its enterprising citizens to develop an \u201cefficient, dynamic and self-reliant economy\u201d (see Section 16 (1)(a), 1999 Constitution).\n\n\u201cIn determining that Lagos State is not \u201ccovered by a national grid system\u201d, we assume:\n\na. Population estimated at 27 million individual, commercial, industrial and other residents (schools, research institutes, street lighting, religious places of worship, etc)\n\nb. Current average daily capacity delivered via the national grid = 1000MW or 1GW c. Current average daily energy availability via the national grid = 12 hours d. Required daily energy availability = 24 hours e. Required daily capacity at = 9,000MW or 9GW (or 300MW/0.3GW per million residents).\n\n\u201cThis Administration believes that coverage ought to be measured not by the mere physical presence of a single generating plant, transmission assets and distribution assets connected in Lagos State to a national grid system. Instead, a more functional definition, as is the global standard, is by a simple energy-based per capita formula of capacity multiplied by availability.\n\n\u201cIf so, we will realise that the national grid delivers to Lagos residents barely 12,000 megawatt hours (MW/h) or 12 gigawatt-hours (GW/h) daily or 444 watt-hours (less than 1 kilowatt-hour) per person per day; when in fact it ought to deliver a minimum of 216,000 megawatt-hours or 216 gigawatt-hours daily or approximately 8 kilowatt-hours per person per day.\n\n\u201cEvidently, the State receives barely 5.5% of its required electricity supply needs from the national grid. The rest is self-generated by the citizens and residents of Lagos themselves, particularly the business community.\n\n\u201cBy no standard of definition can this be defined as \u201ccovered by a national grid system\u201d. Rather, it is a case study in extreme energy inefficiency.\n\n\u201cAnother way to appreciate the dire situation in Lagos is to note that the entire energy stock for Nigeria delivered via the national grid system to all consumers in Nigeria (assuming a daily average 4,500MW of which 80% is delivered to all 11 Nigerian Discos for an average 12 hours daily) is 43,200 MW/h daily.\n\nIn 2014, this stock of self-generation was measured by the Lagos State Electricity Board at 15,000MW of capacity, over three times the capacity nationally available from the public electricity grid today.\n\nThe Lagos Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) will meet future electricity demand by establishing the availability of fuel and electricity generation resources that are available within the State.\n\nHowever, it is also a non-negotiable strategic necessity that the Lagos IRP will require that any energy solution deployed in the State must be environmentally-friendly and climate efficient. The use of distillate fuels such as petrol, diesel and LPFO over the decades to power socioeconomic activity has had incalculable polluting and environment-damaging effects.\n\n(With reports from EnergyDay).",
          "summary": "Currently plans are in the pipeline for Lagos State Government to set up a state -owned electricity generation, transmission and distribution company to provide power for the over 20 million residents.\nThe detail of the plan was contained in the Lagos State Electricity Policy Consultation Paper signed recently by Engr.\nIt was on the basis of this that the state assembly enacted the extant Lagos State Power Sector Reform Law of 2018.\nIt also provided for the Lagos State Electricity Board to take responsibility for driving \u201crural electrification\u201d (a term whose definition is still imprecise).\nIn 2014, this stock of self-generation was measured by the Lagos State Electricity Board at 15,000MW of capacity, over three times the capacity nationally available from the public electricity grid today.",

An elder of this church, who works with the World Health Organisation, confirmed this, thanking me for always speaking the truth about the authenticity of the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said vaccinators went to churches to get people vaccinated, adding that such was an \u201cinsult,\u201d insisting that every church \u201cis anti-COVID-19 zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an insult! What an assault! Nobody has the right to enforce vaccination on you, and anybody cannot terminate your employment because you refuse to take the vaccine, my God will show up (for you).\n\n\u201cDid I tell anyone I am sick? Don\u2019t let anyone harass you into doing what you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d he added.\n\nOyedepo also alleged that the side effects defeated the benefits of taking the vaccine.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey wanted Africa dead. I heard them say it. When we didn\u2019t die as they proposed, they brought out this vaccination scheme. You need to hear their proclamation that Africa will lack spaces to bury corpses. But, today, reverse is the case. Africa has the least casualty among all the other continents of the world.\u201d\n\nThe auditorium, filled to capacity, did not have anyone with masks on or following any COVID-19 procedure as Oyedepo said the foreigners who came for the anniversary had returned to their home countries in good health.\n\nHe recommended a shot of anointing oil taken to kill the virus.

We don\u2019t need to greet Adeboye. What is my own with that? We are not doing church here. This is not religion.\n\n\u201cPastor Adeboye didn\u2019t speak about the Yoruba nation. Look at the number of crowd in Baba Adeboye\u2019s church. Is he not supposed to tell all of them to join the Yoruba nation? We don\u2019t need to greet him.\n\n\u201cGod himself will start asking questions from all the enemies of the Yoruba race. By the grace of God, anybody who says Yoruba will not get to the promised land, God will kill their children and wives and their entire family.\u201d\n\nThe comment generated outrage from many Nigerians, who condemned the self-acclaimed activist for being insensitive to the present ordeal of the septuagenarian.\n\nFollowing the negative reactions on social media, Sunday Igboho has come out to deny mocking Pastor Adeboye, praying that \u201cmay God forgive the dead and may his soul rest in peace.\u201d\n\nAccording to Igboho, he was misquoted, adding that he only rained curses on the enemies of the Yoruba race and not the man of God.\n\n\u201cThey said I mocked Pastor Adeboye, I didn\u2019t mock that man. He is our father. I wasn\u2019t talking to him. I don\u2019t know him and he does not know me. I am a Christian. Had it been that I am a Muslim, they would have said I\u2019m trying to be religious intolerant.\n\n\u201cI was only saying the Yoruba nation is not a religious matter. We accommodate Muslims, Christians, and traditionalists. I didn\u2019t insult that man. People just misquoted me by cutting that part of the video. Did I mock him? I didn\u2019t say anything concerning him.\n\n\u201cI was asked a question about the death of his son, how will I mock him over his son\u2019s death. I can\u2019t pray that his son should die. I didn\u2019t say anything negative about him. I said all elders who have the power to assist the Yoruba race but choose not to, I rained curses on them.\n\n\u201cGod who created us knows when we will go back. Whoever mocks the dead will also die one day. We all will die. How will I mock the dead? I didn\u2019t insult the deceased son. May God forgive the dead and may his soul rest in peace.

          "text": "In October 2014, Mrs Offiong (not real name) received some documents from Metropole Interproject Limited introducing the sale of a \u201cone unit of three-bedroom corner piece bungalow apartment at South Pointe II Estate\u201d at Ajah, Lagos, for N17,967,000 million. She was instructed to pay 50 percent of the cost if she accepted the offer.\n\nRetiring at the top cadre in the civil service after 30 years, she did not hesitate to invest her gratuity because the supposed estate was in a prime location: the building\u2019s specifications and the estate\u2019s facilities as stated in the contract looked top notch; the delivery date was less than a year away in August 2015.\n\nShortly after paying the initial deposit of N8,983,500 million to Metropole Interproject Limited and a receipt bearing the name of its parent company, Gran Imperio Group was issued to Mrs Offiong on a scheduled visit to the site, Gran Imperio Group took subscribers to South Pointe One, instead of South Pointe II.\n\nMrs. Offiong\u2019s first deposit\n\nReceipt issued to Mrs Offiong by Metropole Interproject LTD after second payment\n\n\u201cThey told us that South Point II was not ready yet, so they took us to South Pointe One to show us what two would look like when it was ready,\u201d said Mrs Offiong\u2019s son, James (not real name), who went with his mother to the site. \u201cThere was a bit of confusion that day. We suspected that something was not right but we calmed down when they told us about another estate that would be completed before South Pointe II.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to subscribers in February 2015, Adiukwu Kechi, an official of the company, notified subscribers of the need to pay their next instalment. To get them to commit to completing their payments, although no land was shown to subscribers during the site visit, Kechi added: \u201cWe have been magnanimous to move you to a site that is beside South Pointe II and will be completed earlier than South Pointe II too, which is Golden Leaf Estate, and a final allocation will be issued too.\u201d\n\nFINAL DEPOSIT YET NO HOUSE\n\nOn the day Mrs Offiong made the final deposit of N8,983,500 million, she received a letter from another staff of Metropole Limited, Nnamdi Ukpabi, notifying her of the allotment of \u2018Block F Unit 1\u2019. But on the delivery date of August 2015, Mrs Offiong and hundreds of other subscribers found out that what they had were buildings and land on paper; they had been defrauded by companies headed at the time by Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, a man later crowned the Ooni of Ife in December of the same year.\n\nMany investors, citing fear of backlash from the monarch, declined to go on record, but they accused the company of defrauding them. FIJ managed to track five people who agreed to provide documents and correspondences with the companies\u2019 officials on the condition that their identities were not revealed. Visits to the locations of the supposed estates, revealed that the estate schemes never materialised.\n\nSouth Pointe.

There are no 380 apartments on the land after seven years. Photo credit: Adeola Oladipupo/FIJ\n\nGran Imperio Group\u2019s subsidiary companies, including Howard Roark Limited and Metropole Interproject Limited, were involved in \u2018Essential Homes\u2019, an ambitious scheme to build and deliver 1,000 affordable bungalow houses to middle and low income earners by the end of 2015. Launched in 2014, six estates \u2014 Lakeview Park I and II; Mid-Land Court; South Pointe I, II; Golden Leaf Estate; Y\u2019hello Estate \u2014 were reportedly created by the company.\n\nFIJ\u2019s check on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) portal of real estate companies with links to Ooni Ogunwusi revealed that Gran Imperior Group of Companies was registered in November 14, 2013, while Howard Roark Limited was registered in 2008. They have inactive status on the portal, which possibly means that they had not filed tax documents in a long time. Metropole Interproject Limited did not appear on the CAC portal.\n\nOoni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi, Ojaja II\n\nInvestigations by FIJ confirmed that Ogunwusi, his daughter Adeola Ogunwusi and 12 others are directors of Gran Imperio Group of Companies. The Ooni of Ife also sits as director on the board of Howard Roark Limited.\n\nESSENTIAL HOMES: CUTTING CORNERS BY BUILDING WITH FAKE MATERIALS ON ENCROACHED LAND\n\n\u201c\u2026We will work towards satisfying our subscribers\u2026,\u201d Ogunwusi said in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe like to distinguish between completed development and successfully completed development. For us, a project is successfully completed when it is fully occupied.\u201d\n\nBut some estates in the Essential Homes scheme were not successful. While many units in South Pointe One were built with substandard materials, others were built on a land that does not belong to Gran Imperio. Golden Leaf Estate did not materialise and South Pointe Two does not exist!\n\n\u201cFortunately, I got my house, though in a sub-standard state. I did what I needed to do and moved on with my life,\u201d replied an investor in South Pointe One, asked by FIJ to be interviewed for this investigation. \u201cThose that I think need your story more are those who paid but didn\u2019t get anything and those whose houses were built on land that doesn\u2019t belong to the Ooni.\u201d\n\nMs Mallama\u2019s receipt from Golden Leaf after initial deposit.\n\nIndeed, for other investors, it was not just substandard buildings; they do not have title deeds recognised by the Land Bureau, a problem tying down their investment, making them unable to sell the properties.\n\nMallama\u2019s Lawyer\u2019s letter to Metropole Limited requesting refund of deposit and payment of default fee.\n\n\u201cApparently, Gran Imperio trespassed into some of the Ojomu land and did not have the right to build my two units on in,\u201d said Mrs Ajenifuja (not real name), an investor in the South Pointe One and Lakeview Park Two. \u201cI have tried now for four to five years with no luck with the Ojomu family as they claimed they were still having issues with Gran Imperio.\u201d\n\nInvestors who paid as much as N30million for a unit told FIJ that many of the apartments built in Lakeview Park Two and South Pointe One did not meet the specifications stated in the contract. They had to spend more money to make the apartments habitable.\n\n\u201cFor South Pointe one, I had to do the finishing myself. It was like demolishing and building a new house,\u201d said Ms Mallama (not real name), who paid N11 million deposit for Golden Leaf the same period she invested in South Pointe One. \u201cI took them to court over the delay and and substandard building and was given a judgment against them and awarded damages which they haven\u2019t paid. I just left it.\u201d\n\nA section of Gran Imperio\u2019s agreement with subscribers to the failed Golden Leaf and South Pointe Two estates\n\nThe buildings were also delivered late \u2014 as much as nine months after the stipulated delivery date \u2014 a breach of agreement that should have made Gran Imperio liable to paying a default fee of 2.5 percent of the deposit received. But investors never got that payment.\n\nNO PROPERTY, NO REFUND. ESTATE PROMOTED BY THE OONI DOES NOT EXIST\n\nIn 2015, Ogunwusi stated that Golden Leaf Estate, a 380-unit apartment developed in collaboration with the British American Tobacco Company (BATC), was undergoing construction and would be delivered in a year.\n\nSubscribers were required to make an initial deposit of 30 percent of the offer price, 40 percent at roofing stage and 30 percent upon completion. Six years later, hundreds of subscribers neither got apartments nor refunds.\n\nMr Jonathan Abu (not real name) was one of them. He initially subscribed to South Pointe Two but agreed to be moved to Golden Leaf Estate because of the \u2018boys quarters\u2019 attached to the bungalow and its proximity to his work place on the Island.\n\nReceipt issued to Abu for the first tranch of payment\n\nReceipt issued to Abu by Metropole for the second payment\n\nAfter he made the first deposit of N6,139,800 in March 2015, nothing happened on the land and he never heard from Metropole Interproject Limited until August 2016, nearly a year and a half after. In a letter signed by two directors of the company, Taiwo Akintayo and Isaac Etim, the company stated that it did not meet delivery schedule because of \u201cunresolved land acquisition issue\u201d. It said a relocation of the project to another site was in consideration.\n\n\u2018I WOULD SAY I WAS DEFRAUDED\u2019\n\nAbu had had enough and he wanted his money back, but he never got it. The company, again, breached a provision in the contract that monies would be returned 90 days after a request was made.\n\n\u201cI would say I was defrauded,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides money, I have to stay in traffic for two hours, the impact on my health in terms of the wear and tear and cannot be quantified.\u201d\n\nFIJ also gathered that employees of the BATC who invested in Golden Leaf estate through the company\u2019s cooperative society did not get properties or refunds. BATC did not respond to FIJ\u2019s request for comments.\n\nMore Investors Onboarded to Already Distressed Projects\n\nIn a sworn affidavit by Isaac Etim, one of the directors of Metropole Interproject Limited in 2016, in response to a winding up petition written by an investor, the company blamed the country\u2019s economic crisis for failing to deliver projects. But investors argued that Nigeria\u2019s economy only began slowing in growth in 2016.\n\nSworn Affidavit by a director of Metropole Interproject Limited\n\nThe director made claims that Metropole could refund the investors and that it had assets. A lawyer to some investors found these claims to be untrue.\n\nIt is not clear when economic downturn began affecting the real estate project; nevertheless, analyses of documents received from subscribers showed that many times in the two years preceding the 2016 economic recession, the company continued accepting money from investors and promised different delivery dates. In February 2015, the media reportedOgunwusi promoting the real estate scheme.\n\nAfter telling investors that economic downturn was why they could not deliver the projects, directors of the company shifted blame to land acquisition challenge.\n\nCorrespondence to investors by directors of the company also blamed land acquisition issues for the delay. A reason not many believe; they accuse the firm of not doing due diligence before collecting billions of naira from investors.\n\nSome investors pondered why new subscribers were onboarded when the project was supposedly undergoing challenges that would make completion difficult, and why the promoters could neither show proof of land nor uncompleted buildings if truly the project was started but stalled by economic recession.\n\nA letter to all subscribers by Bamidele Arowolo, Gran Imperio\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, assuring them that all \u201chindrances\u201d had been resolved and apartments would be delivered from May 2016 turned out false.\n\nThe company subsequently relocated to an unknown location and staff members stopped replying mails and answering phone calls, investors lamented.\n\nBILLIONS COLLECTED BUT NO PROPERTY, NO REFUNDS\n\nHaving seen Ooni Ogunwusi rub shoulders with politically powerful peole, including President Muhammadu Buhari, who many times said that no acts of corruption would go unpunished in his administration, some investors, at the time, got discouraged and simply \u201chanded the matter to God\u201d. Others who frantically headed to court soon found that it was an exercise in futility.\n\nWith multiple law suits, Ogunwusi\u2019s company selected court hearings to attend and failed to honour out-of-court agreements and judgments, FIJ was told. While some were refunded a fraction of the money they invested, others got nothing.\n\n\u201cSo when we went to court and they never showed up, I just knew nothing would come out of this. They probably would just kill the case,\u201d said Oluwashina (not real name) who lost N5,010,000 to the South Pointe Two scheme and was not refunded. It was the first major project he started with his wife.\n\nReceipt issued to Oluwashina after the first tranch of the initial payment was deposited.\n\nReceipt issued to Oluwashina after the second tranch of the initial payment was deposited.\n\nIn addition to suspicions by subscribers that Ooni Ogunwusi was using his influence to frustrate the court cases against his companies is the question: is the company financially capable of paying hundreds of investors it owes millions of naira?\n\nIsaac Etim, one of the directors of Metropole Interproject limited, claimed in a sworn affidavit that the company was \u201csolvent\u201d and in \u201cgood financial standing\u201d, adding that \u201cthe sum being requested by the petitioners cannot be compared to total assets and worth of the respondent\u201d \u2014 a claim that did not result in refunds to the investors.\n\nThe petitioners\u2019 lawyer, Mr Lawrence Owube, told FIJ that the case could not \u201cproceed beyond getting a liquidator to take over the supposed assets of the company because we could not even find it anywhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey have nothing to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company was more or less like a shell company; they have no asset, nothing physical to recover from them.\u201d\n\n\u2018AN ELABORATE SCAM\u2019\n\nEtim may have committed perjury by lying under oath, a crime punishable by imprisonment, considering Barrister Owube\u2019s revelations.\n\nNnamdi Ukpabi, the marketing officer of Gran Imperio, was contacted for comments, as his name had appeared on many documents seen by FIJ. \u201cI was just an employee, go and ask the drectors what they did with the company and don\u2019t call me again,\u201d he said aggressively.\n\nFor months, accusations that top management officials of Gran Imperio defrauded investors, lingered. Even the Ooni of Ife was not spared. Unlike many investors who did not have direct access to Ogunwusi when he became King, a subscriber, Oluwaloni (not real name), used his contacts in Nigeria\u2019s federal Government and the diplomatic community to put pressure on the Ooni. He said that the project was an \u201celaborate scam\u201d.\n\n\u201cOgunwusi himself explained to me that he had sold the company to the management of the company, when he became the Ooni of Ife,\u201d said Oluwaloni, who had paid N6.7million but got only N1million as refund.\n\n\u201cIf I was a novice in finance that would fly, but what I saw that happened was that he was trying to remove his name from the board so all he did was he just sold off the company in a sort of way that makes it look like he was no longer the owner but he was still the owner.\n\n\u201cAfter they discovered that they could not pay us, they started selling the plot again to other unsuspecting people \u2014 to make payment to old people. At a point, they were telling me that if I could get someone that would subscribe to the project, they would be able to pay me.\u201d\n\nOluwaloni\u2019s email to directors of Gran Imperio\n\nOluwaloni\u2019s email to Taiwo Akintayo, director at Gran Imperio\n\nOluwaloni\u2019s email to Gran Imperio following failure to refund him.\n\nTHE OONI ENCOURAGED INVESTORS TO PAY BALANCE DESPITE KNOWING PROJECT WAS DISTRESSED\n\nOoni Ogunwusi knew about the problems investors had with his company, as a letter to all subscribers shortly after he became the Ooni showed. The letter, signed by the Ooni, stated his position as Chairman and was co-signed by Taiwo Akintayo. It was written on January 2016.\n\nLetter written by Ooni Ogunwusi to all subscribers to his distressed real estate scheme\n\nIt began with an apology for \u201cslow pace of work\u201d and continued by listing some challenges. He further urged investors, many who neither saw land nor building on the supposed estate, to \u201csupport with your payment (if you still have any due) to enable us deliver as soon as possible\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that Gran Imperio Group remains a going concern and I am still committed to drive [sic] the vision of the company to even greater heights more than ever before,\u201d Ogunwusi wrote.\n\nEVASIVE GRAN IMPERIO STAFF\n\nEfforts to get comments from Gran Imperio were unsuccessful. A lady who answered the call to one of the phone numbers on the firm\u2019s letterhead, claimed it was a wrong number. A call to the second number was answered by one Humphrey Obadjere, who claimed to be an accountant that had left the company.\n\n\u201cMy job was to accept money and keep accounts; I can\u2019t speak about the matter; talk to sales people who interface with the subscribers,\u201d Obadjere said, declining to tell FIJ\u2019s reporter the current address of Gran Imperio.\n\nTayo Ibironke, the Sales Manager of Gran Imperio at the time the alleged fraud occurred, questioned why he was contacted as he no longer worked at the firm. He dismissed questions and asked to be contacted after an hour, but subsequent calls to him after the hour did not connect.\n\nTayo Akintayo, a director at Gran Imperio, neither answered multiple calls to his number nor replied text messages. Calls to other persons in charge of the company as of when hundreds of investors were allegedly defrauded, including Isaac Etim, Head of Sales, and Sylvester Oyewole of the Finance and Accounts Department, did not connect.\n\nThe Ooni of Ife could not be directly reached for comments. His Personal Assistant, Tomisin Olawale, refused to explicitly state Ooni Ogunwusi\u2019s connection to Gran Imperio. He said questions should be directed to Gran Imperio\u2019s staff dealing with the daily operations of the company.\n\n\u201cHe (Ooni Ogunwusi) would not be able to answer even if you were in front of him; he would still tell you to go and meet the MD of the company,\u201d Olawale said, parrying other questions.\n\nA NONEXISTENT COMPANY\n\nFIJ tracked Gran Imperio to three locations on Lagos Island. No one on Plot 33 Jay Jay Oladimeji Close, Lekki Phase One, had heard of the company.\n\nAt Lake View Park One Estate, it was gathered that the company has an office at Lake View Park Two, were buyers of properties go for verification. The security men at Lake View Park Two Estate would not clearly state whether the company that owns the property they work for has an office in the estate. They also denied FIJ access to the company.\n\nFROM LAGOS, OONI\u2019S CASE FILE SUDDENLY TRANSFERRED TO ABUJA\n\nShortly after James Offiong reported Ooni Ogunwusi and his company directors to the Lagos office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over the loss of his mother\u2019s gratuity to a bungled real estate investment, N4 million was refunded within one year. The remaining N13,967,000 was never recovered.\n\n\u201cAfter a while, we went back to the EFCC to keep pushing and then they said the file had been sent to Abuja; who will go to that place to fight this?\u201d James asked. \u201cAlthough they did not tell us that there was nothing they could, it showed on their faces; everybody was just looking at us with pity.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Wilson Uwujaren, the EFCC\u2019s spokesperson, declined to confirm whether a complaint file against Ooni Ogunwusi was transferred to Abuja to frustrate the case. He requested that documents should be sent to him before he would give comments.\n\nTwo days after Oluwashina wrote to the Consumer Protection Council (now the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission) in 2016 requesting assistance in recovering his money, he got a reply from Joshua Nggada, the head of the Lagos office of the agency, informing him that investigation had begun.\n\nBut that was the last he heard from the agency. Oluwashina neither recovered his money nor received a feedback on the progress of the investigation.\n\nBoth the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and its Director General, Babatunde Irukera, did not respond to requests through multiple channels for comment about why the Commission went quiet on the petition for many years.\n\n\u2018THE LAW IS RIGGED TO FAVOUR THE POWERFUL\u2019\n\nYears after, investors are pained that no one has been held accountable.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in this country believe they have the law enforcement in their pockets, collect money from people and not deliver\u2026 in other countries, subvert the law and you go to jail, no matter who you are,\u201d said Abu.\n\nDespite the controversies his companies are enmeshed in, Ooni Ogunwusi has not publicly made comments. The directors of the companies have disappeared; some have started their own real estate firms.\n\n\u201cIf Gran Imperio is the Nigerian entity involved in the alleged fraud, it is not impossible to lift the veil of incorporation to discover the individuals behind the company and hold them accountable,\u201d said Abimbola Ojenike, a Lagos-based lawyer and FIJ\u2019s Legal Adviser.\n\n\u201cDirectors of the company or persons in the effective control of the company cannot hide behind the corporate veil to avoid liability especially if they are the \u2018humans\u2019 involved in the specific incriminating conduct for which the company has been accused.\u201d\n\nIn their quest to get justice, frustrated investors described the process as \u201crigged to favour the powerful\u201d, forcing them to almost give up on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn a personal note, I think it\u2019s necessary for us to have values as a country and there should be justice,\u201d said James.\n\n\u201cEnsuring justice is how you provide equity to people who are at the bottom and how you can hold people at the top accountable. We don\u2019t take the issue of justice and pervasion of justice seriously in this country.\u201d\n\nCredit: This investigation was first published by Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ)",

          "text": "More than 300 people were wounded Monday in renewed clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police in Jerusalem, Palestinian medics said, as an Israeli celebration of its 1967 takeover of the holy city threatened to further inflame tensions.\n\nPalestinians hurled rocks at Israeli officers in riot gear who fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas on the esplanade of the revered Al-Aqsa mosque, an AFP correspondent at the scene said, following a night of sporadic clashes.\n\nLoud booms and angry screams echoed from the ancient stone walls of the compound, revered by both Jews and Muslims, where tear gas filled the air and the ground was littered with rocks, stun grenade fragments and other debris.\n\nThe violence was the latest in days of the worst such disturbances in Jerusalem since 2017, fuelled by a long-running bid by Jewish settlers to take over nearby Palestinian homes in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.\n\nDespite mounting international condemnation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he supported the Israeli police force\u2019s \u201cjust struggle\u201d amid the Jerusalem clashes.\n\n\u201cWe insist on guaranteeing the (religious) rights of all, and this from time to time requires the stability and steadfastness that the Israeli police and our security forces are currently displaying,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice said Jewish \u201cprayers continue as usual\u201d at the Wailing Wall, which adjoins the esplanade, adding that \u201cwe will not let extremists threaten the safety of the public\u201d.\n\nJerusalem Day\n\nThe UN Security Council was to meet at Tunisia\u2019s request later Monday on the unrest that has escalated since the last Friday prayers of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.\n\nA key court hearing scheduled for Monday on Sheikh Jarrah, the flashpoint east Jerusalem neighbourhood at the centre of the property dispute, has meanwhile been postponed.\n\nThere were fears of further violence ahead of a planned march Monday by Israelis to commemorate the takeover of Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War, an anniversary known as \u201cJerusalem Day\u201d in the Jewish state.\n\nIsraeli police had, as of Sunday, approved the march, which was re-scheduled to start around 5:00 pm (1400 GMT).\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent put the toll at 305 injured, including more than 200 who were hospitalised, five of them in critical condition.\n\nThree people lost one eye each, said surgeon Firas Abu Akari at east Jerusalem\u2019s Maqassed hospital.\n\nNear the Old City, a car carrying Israelis was pelted with stones, lost control and rammed into Palestinians, according to police and footage from a journalist on the scene.\n\nOnce stopped, the vehicle was attacked by around a dozen people who continued to hurl projectiles at the passengers before an Israeli policeman dispersed the crowd by firing into the air.\n\nThe Israeli police reported nine injuries in their ranks.\n\nUS

Al-Aqsa, Islam\u2019s third holiest site \u2014 has met widespread criticism.\n\nAll six Arab nations that have diplomatic ties with Israel \u2014 Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan \u2014 have condemned the Jewish state.\n\nIn Jordan, the custodian of Jerusalem\u2019s holy Islamic and Christian sites, King Abdullah II condemned \u201cIsraeli violations and escalatory practices at the blessed Al-Aqsa mosque\u201d.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation, urged \u201cthe UN Security Council to take measures on the repeated violations carried out by Israel\u201d.\n\nThe Middle East quartet of envoys from the EU, Russia, the US and the UN \u2014 and Pope Francis \u2014 have all called for calm.\n\nCourt case delayed\n\nMuch of the recent violence stems from a long-running legal effort by Jewish settler groups to evict several Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah.\n\nA lower court ruling this year backing the settlers\u2019 decades-old claim to the plots infuriated Palestinians.\n\nA Supreme Court hearing on a Palestinian appeal had been set for Monday, but the justice ministry said Sunday that in light of \u201call the circumstances\u201d it would delay the hearing.\n\nIsrael annexed east Jerusalem following the 1967 takeover, a move not recognised by most of the international

Palestinian protesters and warned Israel of retribution if evictions proceed in Sheikh Jarrah.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) has begun the construction of a 1\u00d77.5MVA, 33/11kV injection distribution substation in Orogun, Delta State to boost power supply to the community.\n\nSpeaking at the groundbreaking ceremony at the weekend, the Managing Director/CEO, NDPHC, Mr. Chiedu Ugbo said the injection substation which is an NDPHC/National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) intervention project would also boost economic activities in the community.\n\nUgbo explained that the project, a 1\u00d77.5MVA 33/11KV injection substation, will step down power from the already existing 33KV line to 11kV, disclosing that the project involves the construction of 4km of 11KV line to distribute the power to the community.\n\nHe said seven distribution transformers will be installed also in the community. He stated that, with the injection substation in place, faults on the down stream line will not be allowed to trip the entire network.\n\nHe noted that the project followed the \u201cpassionate\u201d intervention of the Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege to have the project in the community.\n\n\u201cFollowing the intervention of the Deputy Senate President, we at NDPHC in keeping with our mandate to improve electricity infrastructure in Nigeria visited Orogun community for location inspection and discovered that the community electricity supply is being fed by old Agbaroh-Abraka 33KV line which transverse swampy terrain.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also discovered that it is not adequate for the community hence this purposeful intervention by Niger Delta Power Holding Company at the instance of the Deputy Senate President\u201d.\n\nHe added that NDPHC has been engaging the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) and has been assured by the DisCo that the project aligns with infrastructure upgrade in the community.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege, said President Muhammadu Buhari was making significant efforts to end energy poverty in Nigeria by facilitating the provision of electricity to rural communities across the country.\n\nOmo-Agege said \u201cthe objective has been to ensure that the number of people who use modern energy should increase to reduce social costs and to increase social benefits\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the establishment of the power substation was one of the several initiatives of the administration aimed at addressing energy poverty in the country.\n\n\u201cSubstations play a critical role in power industry. Substations support the transmission grid in moving power from generation sources to customer\u2019s load, while electrical utilities use them for system protection, switching capabilities and more importantly, voltage transformations.\n\n\u201cIt is thus my hope that the construction of the injection substation will boost access to energy in the region and consequently bring about enhanced economic activities and poverty reduction through enhanced income, health, education and improved environment\u201d, he said.\n\nHe then called on the Benin Electricity Distribution Company, BEDC, to make good use of the facility when completed to boost power supply to the communities, urging the utility to ensure that meters are provided for individual customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier, the General Manager, Distribution, Engr. Gadzama M. Mele who gave details of the project stated that the project involves the construction of 7.5MVA, 33/11kV injection substation and 4km of 11kV lines with installation of 7nos 300KVA, 11/0.415kV Distribution substations and construction of 2.5km of low tension (LT) lines to take power to the door step of the community.\n\nEngr. Gadzama also stated that benefits to derive from the project include but not limited to voltage control, localisation of faults and creation of job opportunities for the community.\n\nAlso speaking, the President General of Orogun Kingdom, Chief Benson Ndakara thanked both the Sen. Omo-Agege and NDPHC for coming to the aid of the community, saying \u201cwhen the power station is fully completed and starts functioning all the knotty power problems and challenges in Orogun and environs will be resolved once and for all\u201d.",

          "text": "Chelsea\u2019s head coach Thomas Tuchel claims the blues will prepare for the Champions League final in the \u201ctrue belief\u201d they can beat Manchester City.\n\nTuchel\u2019s side have now beaten their final opponents twice in recent weeks following Saturday\u2019s 2-1 Premier League victory at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nThe London outfit were also triumphant when the sides met in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley last month.\n\nChelsea manager Tuchel accepts these results may not have a huge bearing on the May 29 showpiece \u2013 after all City made multiple changes for both games \u2013 but they cannot damage confidence.\n\nThe German said: \u201cI said before it would not change too much, no matter what result came out of this game. I will stick with that but surely it\u2019s not a disadvantage for us to have this experience, in such a short time, of beating them twice.\n\n\u201cWe know very well that if you play a final, it\u2019s very special and you fight for every centimetre and every advantage that you can make to win the game. \u201cBut, yes, it gives us the true belief that we can do it because we\u2019ve already done it. We\u2019ll try to conserve the feeling and this momentum for our arrival in Istanbul, because we\u2019ll arrive with a clear target and a clear objective to win. \u201cThe best way to play a final is to be self-confident and I think we can conserve this feeling from these two matches.\u201d Tuchel also believes the importance of Chelsea\u2019s games in the build-up to the Champions League final will help them to maintain their sharpness and momentum.\n\nAlthough Saturday\u2019s win lifted them to third, Chelsea still have work to do in their final three fixtures to secure a top-four position. They also face Leicester in the FA Cup final next weekend. Tuchel, whose side host Arsenal on Wednesday, said: \u201cIt feels like every game is a really decisive game because in all competitions we need to fight hard to fulfil our goals and our dreams. \u201cWe take it like it is. It is not a disadvantage. I like the atmosphere and the spirit and the context of the games as we are constantly under pressure.",
