          "text": "GOVERNORS in the 17 states of southern Nigeria on Tuesday demanded that the President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd), should address the country on mounting security challenges and restore the confidence of the people.\n\nThe governors, who held a four-hour meeting in Asaba, Delta State, chaired by the Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, resolved to ban open grazing in their domains.\n\nThe group, in a 12-point resolution, urged Buhari to convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency.\n\nThey also demanded that bold steps be taken towards the restructuring of the country, saying state police had become a necessity.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 read in part, \u201cThe forum affirm that the people of southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness and peaceful co-existence between and among its people with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\n\n\u201cWe observe that the incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities, leading to a threat to food supply and general security. Consequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAgreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian federation, leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism, southern governors expressed very grave concern on the security challenge currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr. President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people.\n\n\u201cIn view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nThe chief executive officers asked the Federal Government to review appointments into government agencies to reflect federal character, saying Nigeria\u2019s overall population was heterogeneous.\n\nThe southern governors also expressed concern on the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and therefore suggested greater coordination and cooperation between federal and state governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\nThe meeting was hosted by the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nAmong governors in attendance were Dr Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos).\n\nAfenifere agrees with southern govs on national dialogue\n\nMeanwhile, different socio-cultural groups in the South supported the governors\u2019 call for restructuring, national dialogue and a state of the nation address by the President.\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, said the demands by the governors were long overdue.\n\nThe Secretary General of the group, Bashorun Sehinde Arogbofa, said there was a need for the President to speak out and take action on the issues.\n\nHe said, \u201cI agree entirely with the governors of the South. At where we are today, there must be a national dialogue. Let the President speak out. If he says those people killing should stop killing, they will stop.\u201d\n\nPANDEF backs forum on open grazing ban, others\n\nOn its part, the Pan Niger Delta Forum declared its support for the decisions reached by the governors especially on the issue of restructuring and banning of open grazing of cattle.\n\nPANDEF spokesman, Ken Robinson, who stated this during an interview with one of our correspondent, said, \u201cWe had expected that they would meet and it is a good thing that they met.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the meeting will now be regular. We have also seen the communiqu\u00e9 that they issued. It is very commendable. For once, the 17 southern governors; the positions they have taken are in tandem with the desires and aspirations of the people of southern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNational dialogue inevitable \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nAlso, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, applauded the southern governors for coming together.\n\nSpokesman for Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, who spoke with one of our correspondents on the telephone, said, \u201cOn the issue of amending the constitution to reflect true federalism, Ohanaeze spokesman said, \u201cThey have asked the President to convoke a national dialogue. They wouldn\u2019t have finished everything today but the truth of the matter is that without true federalism, this country will not last long.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Africa is ready for sustainable investment.\u201d\n\nThe objective of the meeting was to devise joint actions to help boost a strong and inclusive recovery in Africa with the private sector.\n\nIt also aimed to give African public development banks the opportunity to demonstrate their role and contribution in supporting the transformation of the continent\u2019s economy and societies towards sustainable and resilient development.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Murtala Mohammed for spate of insecurity in Nigeria is \u201cfake news and disinformation\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe minister said this on Tuesday in Lagos during a meeting with Online Publishers.\n\nMohammed, who expressed dismay over the reports clarified on what he said, when he recently featured on Channels Television\u2019s News programme.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing at times how people interpret ones\u2019 opinions and views in a very negative sense.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that, the lead speaker at a Town Hall Meeting we held in Kaduna recently, made reference to the retreat by the former military Head of State Gen. Yakubu Gowon, after the civil war.\n\n\u201cHe said that at the end of the retreat, there was consensus that all children born after the civil war must be given free and compulsory primary education.\n\n\u201cI simply elaborated on this information and said that if subsequent governments after Gen. Gowon had perfected this pledge, the bandits and kidnappers today will have no market to recruit their followers.\n\n\u201cI said we have about 13 million out of school children and if successive government had taken the decision at the Gowon\u2019s retreat seriously, we will not be where we are today.\n\n\u201cThere was nowhere I blamed Gen. Murtala Mohammed, but we are in the era of disinformation and fake news,\u2019\u2019 he explained.\n\nThe minister said he was also misunderstood on his position that kidnapping and banditry were not offences that could be prosecuted by the Federal Government.\n\nHe said while his position was correct, it was not meant to absorb the federal government from the responsibility of fighting crimes as it was misinterpreted by some people.\n\n\u201cI was responding to the opposition PDP which said that the Federal Government has not prosecuted any bandits or kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI said it is not the responsibility of the federal government to prosecute bandits or kidnappers.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility of the federal government is to hunt them down, arrest them and hand them over to the states judiciary to prosecute.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, this morning, it was reported that 48 kidnappers were neutralised by the military in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThose who were arrested will be handed over to the Zamfara state government for prosecution,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister reiterated that there were some laws which were at the exclusive execution by the federal and state level respectively.\n\n\u201cAs of today and until we amend the law, the federal government cannot prosecute suspected kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u201cThat was why the notorious kidnap kigpin, Chikwudubem Onwuamadike, also known as Evans is being prosecuted in the Lagos state court and not in Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said Nigerians must be concerned about the spate and effects of fake news and disinformation.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "Local government elections and grassroots democracy",
          "text": "By Raymond Mordi, Deputy Political Editor\n\nDemocracy is often associated with direct representation, which existed in the ancient Greek city-states where the concept originated. But, since having an assembly of the entire body of qualified citizens to take political decisions is impractical in most modern societies, elections are a vital component of democracy because it gives citizens the right to select those who will govern them.\n\nNigeria operates a federal system made of the Federal Government, 36 state governments and 744 local governments. Under the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the three levels of government are supposed to be relatively independent. In reality, the Federal Government and the state governments have a lot to do that impacts the lives of the people. The local government is the weakest level of the three because it has the least power.\n\nSince the return to civil rule in 1999, Nigerians have regularly had the opportunity in nationwide elections to vote to elect their president and state governors. Through court judgments, some states now elect their governors in what has become known as an off-cycle governorship election.\n\nBut, elections for the office of the chairperson of local governments and councillors are a different ball game, as they have been for the most part been by appointment, rather than through elections. Some studies say only about a quarter of the 744 chairmen and councillors are elected, while the remaining 75 per cent are those appointed. In other words, although local councils are the closest to the people, they do not get the opportunity in three-quarters of the local governments to make an input in deciding who leads them at this level. Thus, many state governments have not been allowing their State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) to conduct elections as at when due, but rather settle for \u2018caretaker committees\u2019.\n\nEven when they are chosen through elections, the process is usually a hallow ritual because the party in power in each state always dominate the process, by clearing all the positions available. As the party in control of the state apparatus, they do not give other political parties a chance to compete for elective positions.\n\nThe 1999 Constitution, which is the enabling legal instrument of the Fourth Republic, mandates the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct elections into federal and state elective positions, while State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIEC) have the responsibility to organise local government polls. While INEC has demonstrated some degree of independence in the course of performing its statutory responsibilities over the years, particularly since 2011, the state election management bodies (SIECs) have become a ready tool for perpetrating electoral frauds during local government elections. This is because in some states, the chairman and members of state electoral bodies are usually card-carrying members of the ruling political party or associates of the governors.\n\nTherefore, local government councils exist at the whims and caprices of governors. Consequently, when a political party is defeated during a governorship election, one of the primary tasks of the new regime is to dissolve the inherited councils. One of the reasons usually advanced to justify this action is that some governors always give the go-ahead order to their SIECs to conduct local government polls on the verge of their exit.\n\nKwara State was one of the few states that had been holding local government polls regularly. But, since the new All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, led by Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq came into power in May 2019, Kwara State appears to have joined the list of states that do not hold the election as of when due. The last time the state held a local government election was November 2017. In September 2019, shortly after he took over power, Governor AbdulRazaq\u2019s administration suspended the elected council executives he inherited from the last administration for alleged financial infractions; even though their tenure was due to expire the following month.\n\nThe Kwara State government is yet to conduct local government elections, two years after he came to power. The government said it is constrained by the various court litigations on the composition of the Kwara State Independent Electoral Commission, the statutory body responsible for conducting the polls. It has continued to assure, however, that it will not hesitate to conduct the council poll once the court cases are resolved.\n\nPolitical scientists believe that politics and elections at the local government level, offer opportunities for grassroots democracy. But, the present framework of local government administration in Nigeria appears to be fraught with contradictions, which place local governments at a disadvantaged position in stimulating and acting as a strong agent of socio-economic development at the grassroots. This is because there is always a \u201cbig man\u201d connected to the leadership recruitment process, as elsewhere in the polity.\n\nWhen some candidates win elections, against all odds on the ticket of a less fancied political party, they usually defect to the ruling party after they are sworn in, to remain relevant in the political set up.\n\nThis is connected to the issue of lack of financial autonomy of the local governments, as well as the lack of independence of the state election management body that conducts local government elections. At the state level, everything revolves around the governor because he who pays the piper dictates the tune.\n\nThis is why Nigerians make so much noise on social media, but on election day, they hardly go out to cast their ballot. The concept of democracy has become so distorted in the country that the people are not inspired to participate; hence, the low turnout witnessed in all elections in the country. Elsewhere in the world, the electoral process is not limited to the campaigns and the casting of the ballot on election day. It is a process based on a lasting dialogue between the people and their representatives, which begins well before and continues between elections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini, appears to share the above view. He recently described the conduct of local elections in the country as \u201corganised crime\u201d. Igini who expressed the view during a live discussion programme on Channels Television, said \u201cwe have lost 774 local government areas in Nigeria to every sitting governor of the 36 states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Local government elections are nothing but organised crime\u201d.\n\nHe said the process of picking council chairpersons and councillors falls short of the standard requirement of an election. He added: \u201cThey should not be calling them elections, at all. They are nothing but coronation ceremonies across Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Many state governments have not been allowing their State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) to conduct local government elections as at when due, as they have been settling for caretaker committees. Even when elections are conducted, it is usually a mere formality, as the party in power in each state always clears the available positions. SUNNY NWANKWO (Umuahia), BASSEY ANTHONY (Uyo), NWANOSIKE ONU (Awka), SIMON UTEBOR (Yenagoa), NSA GILL (Calabar), OKUNGBOWA AIWERIE (Asaba), AHMED RUFA\u2019I (Dutse), KOLADE ADEYEMI (Jos), TOBA ADEDEJI (Osogbo), OSAGIE OTABOR (Akure), BISI OLADELE, YINKA ADENIRAN (Ibadan), LINUS OOTA, (Lafia), BISI OLANIYI (Benin City), RASAQ IBRAHIM (Ado-Ekiti), ABDUGAFAR ALABELEWE (Kaduna), ADEKUNLE JIMOH (Ilorin), MIKE ODIEGWU, ROSEMARY NWISI (Port Harcourt) and DUKU JOEL (Damaturu) give a picture of the situation in their respective states\n\nThe recent Supreme Court judgment over the disagreement between Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and sacked local government chairmen and councilors in the state could be regarded as a victory for democracy at the grassroots. But, the situation in other parts of the country suggests that the position held by the Oyo State Government is not an isolated one.\n\nAbia:\n\nSince the return of democracy in 1999, Abia State under the administrations of Orji Uzor Kalu and Theodore Orji ran the 17 local government areas with Transition Committee (TC) chairmen. This has received wide condemnation by critics of the governors.\n\nUnder Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, however, the state has held local government elections twice: December 17, 2016 and December 18, 2020. As it has been the trend elsewhere in the country, the PDP won the entire seats.\n\nA political analyst, Gilbert Chijioke, said using transition committees has become fashionable among the governors because some of them now see it as a way of subverting the constitution. He said: \u201cIt is in the state that we once heard that someone got the position of a local government chairman just by singing during party gatherings. Still in this state, we heard that allocations were shared by balloting. Is that not abuse of the constitution?\n\n\u201cHow many of the TC chairmen are not in one way or the other related to the governor or the party chairman? The governors have the powers to determine who becomes the TC chairman. Because they (governors) have the powers to determine who gets what at the end of the month, they will prefer to use TC chairmen to run the affairs of the local governments than elected chairmen.\n\n\u201cApart from the Isiala Ngwa South LGA chairman, Ikechukwu Anyatonwu, tell me who else that made an impact while in power? Some see it as empowerment and a means of settlement by the governor and therefore, are accountable to the governor and not the people as it should have been.\u201d\n\nAkwa Ibom:\n\nAkwa Ibom State conducted its last local government election on November 2, 2020 and expectedly, the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) won in all the 31 councils and 368 wards. Constitutionally, the tenure of local council administration in Nigeria, including Akwa Ibom lasts for three years. Going by this, the council chairmen and councillors would complete their time in office by November 2022.\n\nHowever, local government has an unpleasant trajectory of failures, disappointments and lack of impact on the grassroots. The sad reality is that local government councils only exist by name, as they cannot perform basic constitutional responsibilities contained in the Residual List.\n\nRead Also: Hopes high for early council poll in Katsina\n\nMany believe the local government councils are incapacitated by lack of adequate funds because federal allocations meant for the running of the grassroots have either been seized or tampered with by the state government in the name of joint account.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, there have been hushed complaints that the executive arm of government has been denying local governments their allocations. To worsen matters, the House of Assembly and the State Chapter of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) have not officially come out to kick against the financial arm-twisting of the councils.\n\nIn fact, proponents of financial autonomy for local governments have said that the challenges faced by the local government system are caused by council chairmen and the State House of Assembly who openly rejected financial autonomy and preferred to be subservient to the governor.\n\nLast year, the Akwa Ibom House of Assembly, voted against local government autonomy.\n\nAnambra:\n\nThe controversy trailing the conduct of local government elections in Anambra State has continued, despite the recent Supreme Court judgement. The last time local council polls were conducted in Anambra State was during the twilight of the Peter Obi administration and it was hurriedly done to fulfil all righteousness.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the next election would have been in 2016, but Obi\u2019s successor, Governor Willie Obiano, has been operating the councils through the caretaker committees.\n\nThe opposition parties have been calling on the governor to organise such an election to give the grassroots a voice. But, the government has insisted that it would be prejudicial for the state to talk about that because they are still waiting for Supreme Court judgment on the matter in court.\n\nPDP Publicity Secretary, Nnamdi Nwangwu said the non-conduct of local government poll is one of the reasons for the increasing criminal activities in the state. His All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, Okelo Madukaife, said the government is insensitive to the plight of the masses.\n\nA group, Recover Nigeria Project (RNP), has threatened that if Obiano fails to do the needful, the state should forget the November 6 governorship election. Its convener, Comrade Osita Obi, gave the warning in a letter addressed to the State Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the state government.\n\nBayelsa:\n\nThe last local government election in Bayelsa State was held on August 10, 2019; about three weeks to the September 3, 2019 primary of the PDP. Before then, the eight local governments in the state were administered by caretaker committees appointed by former Governor Seriake Dickson.\n\nThe main opposition party, the APC, boycotted the August 10, 2019 polls, citing lack of confidence in the composition of the state electoral body as reason.\n\nAs expected, the PDP won all the chairmanship and councillorship seats. The election, it was believed at the time, was a masterstroke for Dickson to rig out former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Ndutimi Alaibe, who was perceived as a strong contender for the party\u2019s governorship ticket.\n\nRead Also: PDP releases guidelines for Lagos LG poll\n\nWith the PDP winning all the council seats, the elected chairmen and councillors became automatic delegates for the PDP primary. The development facilitated the emergence of Senator Douye Diri, now governor, as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nLocal governments in Bayelsa, like others across the country, are confronted with paucity of funds to carry out their obligatory duties to the people at the grassroots.\n\nCross River:\n\nThe last local government election in Cross River State was conducted on May 30, 2020, and the elected 18 local councils\u2019 chairmen with their deputies were sworn in two days after.\n\nHowever, there are fears that the next election, which would be due by May 30, 2023, may not hold. Governor Ben Ayade will be concluding his second term in office on May 29, 2023, and his successor would be sworn in. Intrigues will likely play out between the outgoing governor and the incoming one, as it happened before between former Governor Liyel Imoke who took over from Donald Duke. Imoke kept a timetable, but he ensured that those who were perceived loyalists of Duke were blocked.\n\nAyade inherited elected council officials whose tenure expired on January 2017. Afterwards, he settled for the caretaker committees to run the councils from January 2017 till June 2020 when the current elected officials were inaugurated.\n\nThough there are elected officials in place, the state government has been having an overbearing control over the council funds; deciding how much they get from the federal allocation that comes monthly. For instance, some local councils receive as much as N150 million monthly from federal allocation, but eventually get as little as N5 million monthly.\n\nFunding of the councils is at the mercy and pleasure of the governor. He decides which month funds are given to councils and how much is given. The new NFIU guidelines on fiscal autonomy for local government councils have been circumvented.\n\nThe State and Local Government Joint Account is backed by a State Law and is managed in a manner that; as the allocations come in from the Federal Government for councils, there are ready state laws that take away funds as first line charge with percentages for different heads amounting to about 40 per cent. For instance, there is a percentage for primary health care. There is a percentage for primary education; a percentage for joint security etc.\n\nThe remaining amount is usually lodged in a joint account that cannot be touched by the council chairmen.\n\nDelta:\n\nDelta State is not an exception. The much anticipated Delta State council polls, which held on March 6, 2021, ended in an anti-climax with the withdrawal of the main opposition party, APC midway into the election. With this withdrawal, the PDP made a clean sweep of all the available seats in the 25 local councils.\n\nAPC Caretaker Publicity Secretary, Sylvester Imonina alleged that there were irregularities because members of his party were harassed and arrested by security operatives. Imonina said the state electoral body refused to allow representatives of the APC to take a record of the electoral materials distributed to the 25 local councils.\n\nRead Also: Delay of Electoral Bill passage threatens 2023 polls\n\nThe 25 chairmen and their deputies have been sworn in by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on March 10. The three-year tenure of the newly-sworn in chairmen would terminate in 2024.\n\nThe major challenge facing local government administration, according to the immediate past chairman of Oshimili South, Uche Osadebe, is not funding, but the pressure by party leaders for patronage. He accused the PDP leaders in Oshimili South of diverting public funds from revenue sources into their personal accounts.\n\nFor Osadebe, unless the issue of local government autonomy is addressed, impactful projects will be a mirage. He advocated for an amendment of the constitution to guarantee the autonomy of local government councils.\n\nEdo:\n\nEdo State last held local government elections on March 3, 2018. The elected 18 chairmen and 192 councillors were inaugurated on March 5, 2018, for a three-year tenure, which expired on March 5, 2021.\n\nAll the 18 chairmen were elected on the platform of the then governing APC, but with the June 19, 2020 defection of Governor Godwin Obaseki from the APC to the PDP, ahead of the September 19, 2020 governorship election, most of the council chairmen and councillors were intimidated and forced to defect with Obaseki to the PDP, with some of them refusing, till the expiration of their tenure.\n\nSince the expiration of their tenure on March 5, the heads of local government administration have been in charge of the affairs. Obaseki is not in a hurry to conduct another local council election.\n\nEkiti:\n\nEkiti State is among the few states where local government elections are held every two years. The last poll was held on December 7, 2019 where the current 16 council chairmen and 177 councillors were elected.\n\nDuring the 2019 election, no fewer than 14 parties had their name appeared on the ballot paper for the election, but four eventually fielded candidates, including the ruling APC and the opposition PDP. At the end, APC candidates were declared winners of the 16 chairmanship seats and 177 councillorship positions by the state electoral commission chairman, Justice Jide Aladejana; a result which the opposition PDP rejected.\n\nThe next local government election is scheduled for December this year. Although the state electoral body has not released the timetable for the poll, the two major parties have been expressing their readiness for the contest, through subtle campaigns in different localities. The local government election is expected to be a dress rehearsal for next year\u2019s governorship contest in the state.\n\nEkiti State President of Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Comrade Oluseyi Olatunde said local government administration in the state is a hoax. He attributed its ineffectiveness to the excessive control of the state government, lack of financial autonomy, interference in the local government affairs by the state government and the issue of Joint State/Local Government Account.\n\nHe said the state government has undermined local governments in the discharge of their functions as the closest government to the people by allegedly diverting its statutorily allocated grants from the Federation Account and giving them paltry sums. He described the state-local government joint account as an aberration and an abuse of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit\u2019s (NFIU) guidelines on financial autonomy for the local governments.\n\nHe said the spirit behind the creation of the joint account has been defeated because it gives undue benefit to the state government over local government. He said: \u201cWe are not satisfied with Joint State/Local Government account arrangement because it has always being abused by the state government. JAAC is like a pool of local government resources.\n\n\u201cIn theory, when allocation comes from Abuja, it would come to that joint account and the state government is expected to add 10 per cent of the IGR before it would be shared to the different local governments. But, in practice, it is not so. Apart from the fact that the money will come into the pool of JAAC, the state government won\u2019t add the 10 per cent and they still take lion share of the money.\n\n\u201cWe are not satisfied with the allocation from the JAAC to the local governments. We are not satisfied because it is against the NFIU guidelines. We want the joint account suspended and allow LGs funds go directly to the councils\u2019 account. We don\u2019t need the interventions of the state. Enough of the intermediary roles. The state should steer clear of the councils\u2019 resources and allow them to administer their funds by themselves.\u201d\n\nJigawa:\n\nLocal government council elections are scheduled to hold in Jigawa State next month. The opposition parties have called on the state electoral body to cut the cost of nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nPDP chairman, Alhaji Babandi Ibrahim Gumel said the cost of the forms is meant to discourage the opposition from contesting the polls, because of the current economic difficulties in the country. He also faulted the state\u2019s electoral body of a deliberate attempt to deny popular candidate, particularly youth to exercise their constitutional right to contest in the post coming local government councils election in the state.\n\nGumel said the sum of N500,000 and N250,000 for the Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for chairmanship and councillorship race is too much, considering the present economic difficulties in the country.\n\nNevertheless, the Dutse Local Government PDP Chairman, Alhaji Sa\u2019adu Barwa said the \u201cfailure by the APC administration in all levels of government\u201d, particularly failure to provide security and social amenities will pave the way for his party to win the forthcoming local council poll. He said: \u201cThe APC exposed Nigerians to economic difficulties by the increase in fuel prices and so many bad economic policies since it took over power in the country.\u201d\n\nKaduna:\n\nKaduna State will hold its local government elections on June 15 to fill vacant positions in the 23 local government areas. But, the contest is already dogged by controversy within the ruling APC. Barely 24 hours after the party\u2019s primary was held, a popular chairmanship aspirant for Kaduna North Local Government, Comrade Yusuf Idris Amoke, has alleged that there were irregularities in his council area.\n\nAmoke said the primary was conducted contrary to the set guidelines for the exercise in the party\u2019s constitution. He said what happened was more of a charade and should not be taken seriously. He has, therefore, called on the party leadership in the state to fix a new date for the chairmanship primary in his local government.\n\nKwara:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKwara State had been one of the few states that had been holding local government elections regularly. However, the current APC administration led by Governor AbdulRahman AbduilRazaq has failed to live up to expectations in this regard. Almost two years into his administration, Governor AbdulRazaq is yet to conduct an election in the 16 local government areas of Kwara State.\n\nWhen he took office, he suspended the elected chairmen and councillors elected under the former PDP administration. The leadership of the councils was suspended in September 2019 for alleged financial malfeasance, a month to the expiration of their tenure.\n\nBut, some of the embattled chairmen challenged the governor\u2019s action in court, while the vast majority of them defected to the ruling APC.\n\nThe governor equally abruptly dissolved the state electoral body upon his assumption of office in 2019. The AbdulRazaq-led government is now insisting that it is constrained by various court cases on the composition of the Electoral Commission and therefore cannot conduct local government elections for now.\n\nPeeved by the governor\u2019s action, the PDP has condemned the government for foot-dragging on the conduct of local government elections. Its spokesman, Tunde Ashaolu asked the governor to immediately commence the processes of conducting the council poll. He also described the appointment of Caretaker Committees by the governor as \u201cunconstitutional, undemocratic, null and void\u201d.\n\nAshaolu said: \u201cIt is public knowledge that the tenure of the suspended chairmen of all the 16 local government councils in Kwara State expired on November 28, 2020. We, therefore, call on Governor Abdulrazaq to immediately initiate the process to conduct elections that will usher in new chairmen, in accordance with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said local governments are the closest to the people and are pivotal to guaranteeing effective governance and even development in any state.\n\nPlateau:\n\nThe situation in Plateau State is unique. Two forms of the administrative system are currently being used to manage local government in Plateau State by the state government. Five of the 17 local governments are managed by people appointed by the state government, while the remaining 12 are managed by elected council chairmen.\n\nIn the six-year-old administration of Governor Simon Lalong, the state has witnessed local government elections once. This was on October 10, 2018. Since the tenure of elected council chairmen runs for three years in Plateau State, their tenure is expected to expire by September this year.\n\nPrior to the inauguration of Lalong on May 29, 2015, the then ruling PDP had conducted a local government election. Of course, the party won in all the 17 local governments, while APC did not win a single local government.\n\nThose who emerged victorious from the 2014 council election were inaugurated, but as soon as Governor Lalong took over, he was under pressure to dissolve those elected chairmen for the new party to gain control of the grassroots. The governor finally succumbed to the pressure and in two months of his resumption of office, he announced the dissolution of the elected council chairmen, and also appointed APC loyalists to replace the elected chairmen.\n\nBut, the governor\u2019s action attracted litigation from the dissolved elected chairmen. Three years after the dissolution of elected council chairmen, Governor Lalong has not been able to conduct another election to entrench democracy at the grassroots. The governor cited internal security in the state, as well as economic recess as an excuse for not conducting the elections.\n\nHowever, on October 10, 2018, Lalong conducted an election in 13 of the 17 local governments, where the ruling party won all the available seats.\n\nThe governor said the election may not hold in the remaining four local governments due to the crisis in those areas. The council areas are Jos North, Jos South, Riyom and Barkin Ladi. He has since appointed caretaker administrations in the four local governments.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the council chairmen were democratically elected to perform their statutory functions, the state government still wields enormous power over them. One of the elected council chairmen in charge of Quan Pan Local Government, Issac Kwallu was removed by Governor Lalong and he was immediately replaced by an appointed caretaker. The case is still in court.\n\nThe governor also removed the elected council chairman of Jos South Local Government and appointed a caretaker chairman to replace him.\n\nNasarawa:\n\nNasarawa State has indicated it will not conduct local government elections because of the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. Chairman, Nasarawa State Independent Electoral Commission (NASIEC), Ayuba Wandai cited the pandemic, logistics and administrative challenges as reasons.\n\nThe three year \u2013 tenure of the current elected council chairmen and councillors will expire on May 28, 2021. The last time council elections were held in Nasarawa State was on May 26, 2018, and they were sworn in on May 28, for a tenure of three years.\n\nThe state electoral commission chairman said N300m was earmarked in the 2020 budget. However, he said the commission will be needing up to N600m for the council polls. He said: \u201cFor us as a commission, we have a budget of N879m for the conduct of the entire local government election in Nasarawa State.\n\n\u201cLegally from our laws, there are only two factors that can make us either call off an election or postpone the election, the first one is insecurity and the second one is lack of funds, we are still waiting for the release of funds from the Governor. But, in House, we are prepared.\u201d\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Sule is not satisfied with the poor performance of the outgoing local government chairmen, who have indicated interest to seek re-election for second term. The governor blames the inability of local councils to pay the salaries on the huge workforce employed by the councils and the lack of initiative of the leaders who have proved too lazy to generate revenue internally\n\nOsun:\n\nDelay by the Osun State Government to appoint caretakers committees to run the affairs of local governments, Area Development Councils and Administrative centres across the state has resulted in uneasy calm among the members of the ruling APC.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola directed council chairmen and political office holders at the local government to vacate their respective offices. The directive was hinged on the expiration of the tenure of political officeholders in the local government areas in Osun on Friday, February 5, 2021. The executives were elected into office under the administration of Rauf Aregbesola on January 27, 2018.\n\nOyetola has already sworn in members of the State Independent Electoral Commission (OSIEC) on October 6, 2020.\n\nBefore the local government election, Aregbesola introduced a parliamentary system of government by enacting the Osun State Local Government Areas Creation and Administration Law. However, on March 3, 2021, the Osun State House of Assembly approved the Amendment Bill on local government administration. But, the House amended sections of the bill to indicate that whenever an elected local leadership is dissolved and no election has been conducted to reconstitute the council, the state must conduct an election to fill the vacancies thereby created. The governor, the new law stated, shall appoint a Caretaker Management Committee to run the affairs of the council for a period not exceeding six months.\n\nThe lobbying within the ruling party for positions in the Caretaker Committee has created disquiet in the party.\n\nOndo:\n\nLocal government elections were conducted in Ondo State in August last year. That was few months to the end of the first tenure of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The local elections were earlier scheduled to hold in April, but were postponed due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. It was the ruling APC that won in all the 18 local government.\n\nBefore the election, the 18 local councils were presided over by caretaker chairmen appointed by Governor Akeredolu for three years. At the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected chairmen, Governor Akeredolu advocated synergy between the State and local government to ensure people living in the villages get enough support from the government.\n\nAkeredolu tasked them to focus on quality health care delivery, education and agriculture.\n\nHowever, low funding from the federation account and the Internally Generated Revenue of the Ondo local councils might hamper their effectiveness. Besides, local council workers now collect percentage salaries depending on the money released from the federation account. It was gathered that what is left for almost all the local councils in Ondo State after payment of salaries are not enough to execute any projects. Grading of earth roads are the most visible projects by the local council Chairmen since they were elected.\n\nUnder the administration of former Governor Olusegun Mimiko, some sources of IGR for the local councils were placed under the state government and the revenue shared every six months. Some local councils collect between N2m and N2.5m every six months from the joint revenue account. It could not however be verified how much the local councils earn from levies and rates but ALGON Chairman, Augustine Oloruntogbe said what is earned from levies is not enough to pay for associated logistics.\n\nOloruntogbe denied insinuation that the state government tampered with the local government fund. He said the council Chairmen would key into the state government agenda just as some of them did as Caretaker Chairmen to be able to construct some roads.\n\nOyo:\n\nThe fight for the soul of the local government in Oyo state has taken a new turn. Recently, the legal tussle that followed the sudden sack of the elected council chairmen and councillors across the 33 local government and 35 local council development area by Governor Seyi Makinde ended in the favour of the sacked council bosses.\n\nMakinde had upon his inauguration on May 29, 2019 announced the immediate dissolution of the local government, basing the decision on some flaws in the conduct of the election.\n\nThe sacked council bosses had approached the court, winning at both the High and Appeal court causing intermittent but interrupted joy among the council bosses.\n\nThe immediate past administration of late Governor Abiola Ajimobi had organised the local government election at the twilight of his eight years tenure.\n\nIn his first four years, Ajimobi could not conduct the poll, based on what he described as legal impediments. Despite pressure from opposition parties, he stood his ground.\n\nBut, towards the end of his second term, the election held on Saturday, May 12, 2018, and the elected chairmen were inaugurated by the State Chief Judge, Munta Abimbola on Monday, May 14, 2018, two days after the election held.\n\nThe election came almost nine years after the conduct of the last local government election in the state.\n\nPrior to the one conducted by the Ajimobi\u2019s administration, the last council election took place on December 15, 2007, during the regime of a former governor, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala. ?The ex-governor had shortly on the assumption of office sacked the council chairmen that emerged during the election conducted by his predecessor, Alhaji Rashidi Ladoja on the eve of his departure from office in 2007.\n\nWhen the Ajimobi administration announced plans to conduct council elections in 2018, the then opposition PDP also announced plans not to participate, saying it would rather put its resources together ahead of the governorship election in 2019. The party had said that it would not waste its resources in an election that the then ruling party (APC) had perfected plans to rig in its favour.\n\nThe election was eventually won by the ruling APC across the 33 LGAs and 35 LCDAs. However, barely four hours after taking his oath of office and oath of allegiance on May 29, 2019 as the new governor, Makinde disbanded the local government administration despite the claims of the sacked council bosses to work with him.\n\nWhile the legal tussle lasted, Makinde appointed caretaker council bosses and administrators for the 33LGAs and 35LCDAs respectively on an initial period of three months. Their tenure was renewed intermittently until a few months ago that the last tenure was not renewed in view of plans to hold local government elections.\n\nThe Oyo State electoral body, upon its inauguration in September 2020, disclosed its readiness to conduct a credible, free and fair election. It initially announced May 15, 2021, as the date of the election, but later shifted it by a week. The election is to hold on May 22, 2021.\n\nHowever, with the Supreme Court victory, the opposition APC has called on the state electoral umpire to shift the date for the conduct of the election to allow its members to participate.\n\nRivers:\n\nThough successive administrations in Rivers State have always found it convenient to conduct local government elections, sometimes, they resort to the use of caretaker committees to run the councils. When Nyesom Wike emerged the governor of Rivers in 2015, the 23 local government areas of the state were run by elected officials. But for political convenience, the governor sacked all of them and immediately constituted caretaker committees to take over their functions.\n\nThe chairmen and councillors were sacked because they were put in place by former Governor Rotimi Amaechi and Wike was determined to remove all vestiges of the former governor from the state.\n\nIn 2018, the governor ensured the conduct of the local government elections, which was swept by the PDP. Just recently in April 17, 2021, a fresh local government election was held in the state. The PDP won everything from chairmanship to councillorship. Therefore, Rivers\u2019 23 local government areas are currently being administered by elected officials, whose tenures are expected to expire after three years as provided by the Constitution.\n\nStakeholders have, however, faulted Wike\u2019s penchant for controlling elected local government chairmen. The governor is fond of suspending them for various offences. For instance, in 2018, Wike suspended 12 chairmen. The affected chairmen then were those of Okrika, Emohua, Abua/Odual, Degema, Khana, Gokana, Ahoada East, Ikwerre, Eleme, Andoni, Omuma and Ogu/Bolo local government areas. They were reportedly disciplined for not participating in state official functions.\n\nLast year the governor suspended some local government chairmen for various offences. The then chairmen of Abual/Odual and Degema local government councils were suspended for failure to attend a meeting called for the inauguration of the COVID-19 palliative committee.\n\nAlso, the then Chairman of Port Harcourt City Local Government Area was disciplined for alleged illegal tax collection. Wike\u2019s action generated misgivings and attracted criticisms from the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nYobe:\n\nThe last local government election that was held in Yobe State was on February 27, 2021, suggesting that the elected council chairmen with their councilors are barely three months in office. Though the election was supposed to have been held in December last year, the commission shifted the date alleging a spike in the COVID 19 cases.\n\nAlthough the state could be credited for conducting the council polls, the exercise did not come without the usual caretaker committee fashion employed by governors to run the affairs of the local councils.\n\nBefore the February 2021 local government elections in the state, former Governor Ibrahim Gaidam, now a senator, only conducted local government elections three times during his over 11 years reign as governor. The elections were held in 2007, 2013, 2017. While the first elected local government chairmen under Gov. Gaidam served for two years, the second and the third only did 18 months respectively in office.\n\nGoing by the above, it could be deduced that the practice of appointing caretaker chairmen at the local government lasted more than six years in Yobe State.\n\nEven with the coming of Governor Buni on board, it took more than a year to conduct the local government election. But, instead, the caretaker chairmen were in charge until last February when the State Independent Electoral Commission finally got the approval to conduct the local government election.\n\nBorno:\n\nIn Borno State, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum has also conducted local government election last December after being elected in 2019 as governor.\n\nBefore the council polls, no local government election had been conducted in the state during the eight years tenure of Governor Kashim Shettima. His predecessor, Sen Ali Modu Sherrif only conducted local government election once during his first tenure as governor.\n\nBorno\u2019s case, many believe, may not be unconnected to the over 10 years security challenges in the state. At some point, some local government areas were completely taken over by the Boko Haram insurgents, hoisting their flags in such areas and renaming them as their caliphates or territories.\n\nThe Nation authoritatively gathered that the two states are operating the state local government joint account which the local government rely on the state government for handouts to execute projects.\n\nEfforts to speak with the Commissioner of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Yerima Ali Yunusari proved abortive as he did not answer several call put to him nor respond to the text message sent to him.",
          "summary": "Constitutionally, the tenure of local council administration in Nigeria, including Akwa Ibom lasts for three years.\nGoing by this, the council chairmen and councillors would complete their time in office by November 2022.\nThe remaining amount is usually lodged in a joint account that cannot be touched by the council chairmen.\nThe three year \u2013 tenure of the current elected council chairmen and councillors will expire on May 28, 2021.\nBesides, local council workers now collect percentage salaries depending on the money released from the federation account.",

          "title": "Why Africans don\u2019t talk about race but Blacks do",
          "text": "By Idowu Odeyemi\n\nBeing African is different from being Black. If you are an African, it means you do not get to know anything about your past, except that you know that your grandmother died due to malnutrition or any of those simple propositions your parents tell you to remind you that you are a product of a particular genealogy through ejaculations. Why is this? History has been excluded from your school curriculum, since the beginning of your primary education, because you are expected to see your ancestors as carcass of what seems to be of value and white men as the originator of what and where you are today. So you just go to the exam hall and tick the box that says Mungo Park discovered the river Niger, even though when he came to the town, women cooked his meals with water from the same river. However, Mungo Park is white and everything a white man sees he names.\n\nYou are African and you don\u2019t get to learn history in school because, today political leaders see themselves as failures. Old people don\u2019t want their young ones to know of their failures. Old men can bear no shame. Yakubu Gowon could not imagine his great-grandchildren learning that the regime he led orchestrated the pogrom of Igbo people. Obasanjo, too, could not bear the guilt of relearning that he was a commander of the army that attempted a pogrom. Therefore, here we are, living in the shadows of our fathers fear and for that, we do not get to learn history except if it is the history of America, history of Britain or the history of the transatlantic slave trade as explained from a very Eurocentric perspective by a European.\n\nBeing African is quite eccentric. You don\u2019t get to be annoyed with your past because you don\u2019t know it. Africans will not have time for race discussion because there is no time. The little time Africans have, they have a lot to fight already: bad roads, epileptic electricity, no salary, corruption, sex trafficking, climate change, bad leaders, terrorism, the other person at the neighborhood who they don\u2019t like because he/she just bought a car, patriarchy, poor water, poor healthcare\u2026 among others. So talking about racism, with all these problems, is quite subtle. Neglect, therefore, becomes Africans ally when it comes to issues related to race.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s sublime novel \u201cAmericanah\u201d tells a lot about Africans and race. Ifemelu does not identify as black, but just African, when she is in Nigeria. It is until she gets to the United States of America that she realizes that there are boundaries to one\u2019s personhood. Being African is different from being Black. Being African means that you live in a geographical place marked as Africa or furthermore, you came from the continent but you now live somewhere else, though your roots are in 0Africa. That is what makes you count as African and even though your British accent is fluent and you barely know that in your mother\u2019s town they speak another language different from English, you count as African. So of course, African is different from being Black. Chimamanda Adichie emphasized the strangeness of transforming one\u2019s personhood from being African into Black through Ifemelu in one of her blog posts:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDear non-American Blacks, when you make the choice to come to America, you become black. Stop arguing. Stop saying I\u2019m Jamaican, Ghanaian. America doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nWith those lines above, Adichie systematically appraised the fact that anywhere you come from in Africa, when you get to America or Europe or any country that is dominated by pink (conventionally called white) people, for the pink people you have no longer any heritage that qualifies you as African. You have been initiated into the class of former Negroes. Because for white people, it is a privilege that you get to be in their country; to enjoy all the luxuries of their good government, who albeit, corrupt and poke-nose in other countries\u2019 affairs, yet, still take good care of their citizen\u2019s welfare, unlike the government of African countries, that all they do is steal and launder money abroad.\n\nAfrican leaders are not concerned about a lot: epileptic electricity is never an issue for them to tackle; bad road is normal since they get to travel in luxury cars. In Nigeria, people no longer buy newspapers; the problem is everywhere for them to see: if you turn your face to the right side, you will see bad-roads, turn it to the left you will see a senator sharing radio for members of his constituency. Despite all these socio-political absurdities, Africans, due to insensitivity, are yet to develop resentments, excluding few who read books outside of school curricula.\n\nAfricans do not talk about race, Blacks do.\n\nOne does not get conscious of the self as black until one gets to America or Europe. This is because Africans don\u2019t care about race. Even though Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart is a negation of another story that attributes Africans as irrational, and Wole Soyinka\u2019s poem Telephone Conversation is another, we opt to know that these writers were not conscious of their Blackness until they came into acquaintance with white supremacy and how it diminishes being Black. In other words, their reaction to racism was not born through intuition but through acquaintance with Race.\n\nYou will think you are just an African, but you will transmit from being African to being black when you travel to a white dominant country who psychologically initiates you to the class of former Negroes. So, please, after transmitting to black, while walking in pedestrian areas, don\u2019t put your hands in the pocket! A cop might have a reason to blow your brain cortex with a pistol. And (s)he will have justifications. Justifications like self-defense. Some white cops may think you were bringing out a gun when they say, show me your hands. Pink people expect every Black person to be a rogue.",

          "title": "Sad reality of current Yobe situation",
          "text": "By Bukar Mohammed Atiyaye\n\nThe state of affairs in Yobe State has become a topic of major concern since the inception of Governor Mai Mala Buni\u2019s administration. Indigenes of the state have been hopeful, transiting to the administration with bells on. This is because they believe having a governor of Buni\u2019s calibre will bring amazingly great things to the state, considering his age, his exposure at the national level and his network. Dozens were jubilating, calling the administration a youth-friendly administration, and the first of its kind in the state\u2019s history.\n\nMany of the occurrences were well anticipated way before they occurred; lucrative positions have been occupied by the youths (or the so-called youths rather), the education sector was declared in a state of emergency, multiple projects were piloted, the state workers celebrate before the end of every month, more funds were injected into upgrading the state\u2019s cargo airport and so many glad tidings. None of these was a surprise to many Yobeans as they elected their governor to do exactly that. Such news trends almost every day on conventional media, social media and the internet. The governor is praised and hailed by his people day in day out.\n\nHowever, many people would perceive it hypocritical; praising and hailing someone when he does good and failing to say the truth when things fall apart. This is what is happening now. It seems his glory days in the state are fading, his people are losing confidence in him and he\u2019s gradually losing followers. This is due to what dozens regard as negligence and incompetence in running the affairs of the state/governance.\n\nThe state of emergency declared on education yielded no results after almost two years. There are still primary schools that host more than 300 pupils in a class, having more than 18,000 pupils in one school with regrettably only 36 permanent teachers. That means every teacher is to 500 pupils. I have not been to every corner of the country but I doubt if there\u2019s anywhere that has such.\n\nThe state was reported to have performed woefully in the 2020 WASSCE, ranking one of the least performing states in the whole country. The report revealed that barely 21% of the candidates passed in that year, whereas the national average performance was 65.24%. The state still ranks one of the lowest states in terms of literacy. Despite the constructive criticism faced by the selection committee, students were taken out of the country only to study at the 646th university in India. Are all these the results of the so-called emergency on education?\n\nIt is only in this part of the world that governments consider the timely payments of salaries as an achievement, often unashamedly coming out to brag about it. Well, for two consecutive months now, there are reports of delayed payment of salaries in some parts of the state. Workers are bitterly complaining while others are scared, thinking the period of enjoying the early payments is nearing its termination. Unconfirmed reports claimed that the delay is due to the huge amount of money indebted to the state.\n\nMoreover, there have been many questions on how an uncompleted project can be upgraded. It will however be closer to normal sense when it is completed first before being upgraded. After injecting a huge amount of money into the upgrading of an uncompleted cargo-airport, everyone is eagerly waiting to see when a cargo plane would land, but it is looking more like an ordinary day dream. Can\u2019t be more confusing!\n\nAnother critical issue is the recent security situation in the state. The attacks on Geidam and Kanamma forced hundreds to flee their homes and seek refuge in some neighbouring Local Government Areas of Gashua, Yusufari, Yunusuri and a few others in Potiskum.\n\nThe annoying part is how the governor failed to remain in the state when the people needed him the most. There wasn\u2019t any clear evidence of his presence in the state, during the attack, until after about 72 hours, when the people have been distressed, many have been killed and displaced. He was busy handling party affairs in Abuja, as if it is his primary responsibility. The only effort made by the governor was only meeting the CDS in Abuja, which was perceived by many to only be for optics.\n\nIt did not stop there, the governor was pictured in Kano for a condolence visit and eventually Sokoto for funerals, a few days after his arrival in the state, still with no clear evidence of visiting Geidam and Kanamma. The only recent commitments we are witnessing from the governor in terms of insecurity is visiting some of the Service chiefs to end insecurity while in Abuja. Meanwhile, there are ranking officers in his state, with firsthand information.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe have seen his counterparts condemning the attacks in their states hours after they occur, sympathizing with the victims, visiting the venue of the incidents by themselves (not delegation) and going to see the C-in-C on the issue in less than 24 hours of the occurrence. This is how every citizen would love to his governor behaving. This is what is expected from every responsible and accountable administration.\n\nUpon all these, the state decides to keep mum. No one talks about it. Many begin to wonder if there are legislators in the state either. They have not summoned the governor on issues like this, not even once. They only see him in the House ceremonially/annually for budget presentations and defence. That is surely not the way. The state has to begin talking. It is not alright. Let the governor be called to doing the needful. Let him be reminded of his actual and primary responsibilities. Most importantly, let it not be an elephant in the room!",

          "text": "Reaffirms faith in God\n\nBy Chiemelie Ezeobi\n\nGeneral Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has broken his silence over the death of his son, late Pastor Oluwadamilare.\n\nThe third child of the family, Pee Dee, as he was fondly called, died last Wednesday in Eket, Akwa Ibom State, where he lived with his family and operated as the Assistant Pastor in charge of Region 35.\n\nThe 42-year-old, who fathered three daughters with his wife, Temiloluwa, was buried on Tuesday after a farewell service at the Youth Centre, Redemption Camp, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway .\n\nIn a video posted on his different social media platforms, Pastor Adeboye said \u201cwe lost a General but we didn\u2019t lose God. One man down, we regroup and advance!\u201d\n\nUrging Nigerians not to cry over the demise of his son, he rather called for prayers for his widow, mother, children, siblings and the entire family.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to thank each and every one of you, for this massive show of love, not just for Dare but for me, my wife, the widow, the children, the siblings\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful, I am only bringing you this brief message not just to thank you but to let you know that by the special grace of God, we are loved of God and because we are loved of God, we are more than conquerors.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that God who knows the end from the beginning, knew long before the foundations of the world that what has happened is going to happen.\n\n\u201cAnd because His word is forever settled, He said all things work together for good to them that love God. We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for good as individuals, as families and as a denomination.\n\n\u201cCry if you wish but don\u2019t cry for Pastor Dee (as Dare is fondly called) because he is resting in glory. Cry because you are the one still fighting the battle.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has caught a glimpse of heaven will not be crying for Pastor Dee because there is no comparison between heaven and earth. But then fight courageously because, on the resurrection morning, we shall meet again.\n\n\u201cIn one of his sermons, Dare himself said God does not need a visa to pay you a visit or to do whatever He wants to do in your life.\n\n\u201cAnd I have told you before, death is not a function of age. Young people die, old people die, children die. And it is not about how long you live, it is how well.\n\n\u201d Even Jesus Christ himself died at the age of 33. John the Baptist never lived to be 34 and yet he was the greatest.\n\n\u201cWe have lost a champion. You would agree with me on that. Let us consider him a seed that we have sown and let\u2019s get ready for a special harvest.\n\n\u201cI want us to join our forces together and produce many champions like Damilare that would go round the whole world and shake the world for the Lord Jesus. That is how we can honour his memory.\n\n\u201cThe church of God is marching on. It doesn\u2019t matter what the devil is thinking now. The devil was rejoicing the day the Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross but he never knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cThe devil was rejoicing when Job lost all his children but if only he knew what was coming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, tears poured as Pastor Dare was committed to mother earth after the farewell service.\n\nAmong the dignitaries on ground were Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide aka Winners\u2019 Chapel, David Oyedepo; his wife, Faith; Pastor David Oyedepo Jr; and Senior Pastor Covenant Christian Centre, Pastor Poju Oyemade; as well as thousands of worshippers and well wishers who connected physically and virtually.\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says Abacha\u2019s $311m refund intact\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Managing Director of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr Uche Orji, Tuesday disclosed that the organisation which manages the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund tripled its profits in 2020.\n\nSpeaking when he appeared on the \u201cGood Morning Show\u201d on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Orji attributed the relative success recorded by the NSIA last year to the business decisions taken by the authority.\n\nHe explained that some of NSIA\u2019s portfolios were up by as much as 50 per cent in dollar terms in 2020, predicting that although the financial technology sector ruled the market last year, there will be a broader profit ecosystem this year as countries continue to open up on the back of increasing Covid-19 vaccine jabs.\n\nThe NSIA helmsman noted that the body had been aggressive in terms of its focus on international equities, private equity investments, venture capital and direct investments in the international market, where much of the profits came from.\n\nHe disclosed that with the exception of just one or two portfolios, every single asset class made substantial returns to the NSIA last year, with the headline number being N160 billion , while the net profit stood at N108.9 billion\n\nFor the 2019 financial year, the NSIA had said it recorded a Total Comprehensive Income (TCI) of N36.1 5 billion, less than that of 2018, which was N44.34 billion.\n\n\u201cAll in all it was a very strong year. So in terms of the earnings highlights, there was also the impact of foreign currency positions on exchange rate devaluation.\n\n\u201cThe headline numbers for profits for 2020 was N160 billion, but if you take out about N51 billion that came from foreign currency positions and devaluations, the core earning was about N108.9 billion. So, it\u2019s quite strong and more than three times what we did in 2019,\u201d Orji stated during the interview.\n\nListing the investments by the authority, he mentioned that the Future Generations Fund had four categories which include public equities in which the NSIA has investments in Japan, United States, across Europe and in China.\n\nThe second category, he stated, is the hedge fund strategy, which includes micro to long-term equities and credit, adding that the organisation also has exposure in private equity across Nigeria and investments in healthcare, aircraft leasing companies, among others.\n\nHe predicted a broader recovery for the equity side of the investments this year, explaining that although stock market growth in 2020 was largely anchored on technology, he expects 2021 to be driven by aviation and the industrial sectors as the world opens up again.\n\nUche stated that fixed income should be closely watched by investors, except for the impact of inflation which he predicted would make interest rates go up and make fixed income instruments fall.\n\n\u201cMy view is that on the balance of risk , we are more likely to see interest rates go up than go down,\u201d the NSIA boss added, noting that venture capitalist funds were also being explored by the organisation.\n\n\u201cOn the average we had almost 30 per cent returns in dollar terms and we are going to be more aggressive in venture capital,\u201d he noted.\n\nUche emphasised that the NSIA was also investing in fintech , software services, data networking as well as biotech and pharmaceuticals, which he noted the authority made quite some money from.\n\nOn infrastructure, the NSIA MD pointed out that the organisation was participating through six areas, including agriculture with the fertiliser programme, roads and financial market infrastructure, with NSIA currently one of the largest investors in the country\u2019s infrastructure financing ecosystem.\n\nIn terms of healthcare, Orji further mentioned that the authority was intervening in the diagnostics and radiology centres in Kano and Umuahia and the cancer centres at the Lagos Nigeria University Teaching Hospital (LUTH)\n\nHe further stressed that the NSIA was in discussions with the University College London, to develop pharmaceutical industries in the country.\n\nOn the Abacha loot, he stated: \u201cThe Abacha fund was $311 million that was returned to Nigeria by the US Department of Justice and Island of Jersey and the agreement was to spread the money in equal measures across three projects.\n\n\u201cThese are the Lagos-Ibadan road, Abuja-Kano road and the Second Niger Bridge. Each of them will get $103million-$104 million. To spend the money we have been required to have external auditors aside our in-house auditors as Deloitte to monitor the disbursement of that fund.\n\n\u201cA civil society group, CLEEN foundation has been appointed by the ministry of justice and also with the US government to also supervise the disbursement of the fund. So, you can imagine that every single pair of eyes possible are overlooking how these funds will be disbursed.\n\n\u201cThe fund is still there intact. Not a dime has been spent. It is being held in our accounts with the central bank,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that another \u20ac4.2 was being expected to be repatriated, which the authorities have agreed should come to the NSIA to be used for the three projects, but noted that additional funds will be raised next year from Sukuk before the handover of the projects can be effected.\n\nOrji said the NSIA was partnering the ministry of works as well as the contractors handling the three mega projects to ensure they are promptly completed, with the Lagos-Ibadan expressway scheduled for inauguration before 2022 ending and the bridge slated for decking by December after Covid-19 disruptions earlier.\n\nHe stated that a huge portion of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway funding will be reclaimed since the road will be tolled.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Insubordination may be one of the reasons that led to the suspension of the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nShocking details have emerged as to how Bala-Usman persistently refused to follow directives from President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn the case involving the lease of land in Tarkwa Bay granted to Global Resources Management Limited (GRML), owners of Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Limited (LADOL), which she unilaterally cancelled and re-allocated to Samsung Heavy Industries Limited, even when the President had directed that the lease be restored.\n\nThe directive was formally conveyed to her by both the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), but she adamantly refused to comply, different sources told SaharaReporters.\n\nIn 2020, the suspended Managing Director of NPA repeatedly turned down directive from President Buhari to restore the approval of the 25 year lease agreement for about 114,552 hectares of land granted to Messers Global Resources Management Limited (GRML) in 2003.\n\nThe land was proposed to house an industrial hub including a shipyard in an effort towards local content development to domesticate some of the projects sourced from outside the country.\n\nThings were going well with the construction of infrastructure including accommodation, storage facilities, and power generation on the site until November 14, 2019 when the NPA, under the directives of Bala Usman cancelled the lease alleging that the company contravened the terms of the agreement for the lease.\n\nWhatsApp Image 2021-05-11 at 17.15.1.pdf REVEALED: How Suspended Nigerian Ports Authority MD, Bala Usman Disobeyed Buhari\u2019s Directive, Cancelled 25-year Lease To Favour Samsung\n\nThe letter dated 14th November, 2019 which was signed by NPA\u2019s General Manager in charge of Land and Asset Administration, Yusuf Ahmed, conveyed the cancellation of the lease.\n\nHowever after extensive review, President Buhari reversed the cancellation through a Presidential directive dated 27th of May, 2020 with Ref No.PRES/97/HAGF/93, directing the NPA to comply by restoring the lease.\n\nAGF Malami conveyed the directive in a letter dated 3rd June, 2020 titled Re: Brief on LADOL Free Zone Disputes and the Need for Federal Government to Intervene Urgently. A legal opinion was attached.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the suspended MD never obeyed the directive.\n\nIt was learnt that it was the same Bala Usman who conveyed the approval of the President for extension of the lease in a letter dated 13th December, 2018 and exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nStakeholders were therefore taken aback when she turned around and cancelled the same lease after some months. See Also Scandal EXCLUSIVE: How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman Awarded Coastline Terminals To Dangote's Proxy Company In Shady Deal\n\nMany observers raised concerns when the news broke because the LADOL project was considered a success story of indigenous investment and local capacity development within the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cThe site in question was originally a disused swamp before it was leased to the firm led by Chief Oladapo Jadesimi\n\n\u201cFor over 19 years, the swamp has been gradually transformed into a wholly developed terminal and industrial zone now known as LADOL Free Zone, a one-stop shop for multinational and industrial companies operating in West Africa.\n\n\u201cIt was commissioned by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on the 10th of August, 2018 in an event hosted by the Managing Director of NPA. At the event, Bala Usman herself praised the operational efficiency and synergy between NPA and LADOL that culminated in the successful berthing of Egina FPSO. During the same event, the Managing Director of Shell confirmed that his company had already gained 40% cost savings from working with LADOL.\n\n\u201cAmong other benefits, the lease was yielding a minimum of about N419 million per annum on rent alone to the government, including other taxes.\n\n\u201cHowever, after the swampy land was reclaimed and developed LADOL Free zone, the NPA cancelled the lease citing reasons that have not yet been substantiated logically.\n\n\u201cFor instance the claim by NPA under Hadiza\u2019s leadership that the sublease was done without their knowledge in a manner that will short-change the country was later found to be false.\n\n\u201cActually, it was discovered that GRML had applied to NPA via a letter dated November 22, 2013, expressing its intention to sublease 11.246 hectares at the LADOL offshore facility.\n\n\u201cIronically, after the cancellation the NPA\u2019s purported lease to Samsung Heavy Industries Limited was at the same terms as the subsisting lease to LADOL yet it was supposed to yield an income of N230.3 million almost half of what LADOL was paying as rent for the same land area. See Also News How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman, Lambasted Buhari\u2019s Government Over Niger, Zamfara Students' Abductions\n\n\u201cWith the backing of NPA and based on the fictitious and unjustified pretext of investor protection to a foreign company who apparently has not invested a dime in the economy but who has allegedly repatriated over $2 billion in the five years of doing contracts in Nigeria, it was clear that Bala Usman wanted to hand over a strategic asset belonging to the country, especially the legacy of the multi-billion dollar investment made into the Egina field development as a gift to Samsung.\n\n\u201cAs the controversy was raging, Samsung capitalised on the delay orchestrated by NPA and proceeded to court. The consequent disagreement sent mixed signals to many partners who stalled their transactions till the conclusion of the ongoing litigations including arbitration in London.\n\n\u201cThe question stakeholders are asking is the value that NPA will create for the country by cancelling a contract already awarded to an indigenous company and re-awarding it on the same terms and lower returns to a foreign company,\u201d a source at the NPA told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother source in Presidency expressed shock at how a public officer will flout directives from the President and allow herself to become an instrument for economic sabotage.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a prominent maritime stakeholder said Bala Usman's actions have led to destruction of investors\u2019 confidence and huge capital flight\n\n\u201cThe lady took many of such actions and we did not know she was not going through the necessary due process. We have now learnt that many of the arbitrariness and insubordination that characterised her tenure did not receive the blessing of either the Minister of Transportation or the President. The fear is that such actions have led to so much destruction of investor confidence and huge capital flight,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\nOther stakeholders complained that Usman's approach to issues led to several litigation against the NPA which had frustrated contractual agreements that preceded her appointment, making the government incur avoidable losses amounting to millions of dollars in the last five years.\n\nThe claimed her numerous defiant actions might have contributed to the sudden and sharp drop in the income of the NPA at a time when the economy is in dire need of revenue, which might have angered the President.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "text": "Almost a month after Uber and Bolt drivers under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA) umbrella held a strike in Lagos, Uber has raised its prices. At the time of the strike in April, the President of PEPDA, Idris Shonuga, said one of the reasons the drivers were striking was the pricing of the rides.\n\nHe argued that the fare prices had become so low it was difficult for drivers to make ends meet and likened driving for cab-hailing services to a type of systemic poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a complaint that we\u2019re hearing from ride-hailing drivers worldwide. In March 2021, drivers made landmark progress after winning a lawsuit forcing Uber to classify them as workers instead of independent contractors.\n\nThat distinction is essential because classifying drivers as independent workers allows Uber and Bolt to avoid paying insurance, paid leave, and other benefits.\n\nThe victory of Uber drivers in London has led to a global push for a similar reclassification with drivers in South Africa and Nigeria planning class-action lawsuits against Uber and Bolt. For now, Uber drivers will take the small victory of raised prices.\n\nIn a statement to driver-partners, Uber said, \u201cWe remain committed to providing a reliable earning opportunity for driver-partners, as well as a reliable and affordable service for riders. With this in mind, starting 11th May 2021, we are increasing prices on UberX by about 13%.\u201d\n\nBetween 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Mondays, and 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Tuesdays through Friday, Uber riders will now pay a base fare of N237, minimum fare of N538; N70 per kilometre and N12 per minute. These fares are up from the previous minimum fare of N500, N200 base fare, N50 per kilometre and N11 per minute.\n\nAt other periods, riders will be charged a minimum fare of N575; a base fare of N255, N75 per kilometre and N12.5 per minute.\n\nThere are reports that the drivers are unimpressed with the changes seeing as one of their demands was that Uber reduce its commission from 25% and give them a say in deciding the fees.\n\nThe President of PEPDA wasn\u2019t available to speak on the phone at the time of this report.",

          "title": "Maviance raises $3m from MFS Africa to digitize financial services across Central Africa",
          "text": "Maviance, a Cameroon-based company providing digital financial services like agency banking and bulk bill payments, has raised $3 million (\u20ac2.5 million) in equity financing.\n\nThe investment is solely from MFS Africa, the cross-border fintech company connecting mobile money providers like MTN to banks like Ecobank across over 34 countries in Africa.\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s investment gives it an undisclosed minority stake in Maviance.\n\nMaviance\u2019s flagship product is Smobilpay, a platform that integrates payments solutions from banks, mobile money operators and telecoms operators. Smobilpay is connected to GIMAC, the interoperability switch of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) \u2013 the central bank of the Central African region.\n\nBecause it is a business-to-business company, Smobilpay may not be familiar with consumers. But the platform serves over 500,000 unique customers a month, according to the company.\n\nJerry Cheambe, Maviance founder, believes the pandemic has helped increase business owners\u2019 appetite for digitising payments. Cameroon is a country of 26.88 million people. Mobile connections increased by 11% to 26.6 million between January 2020 and January 2021 while internet penetration is at 34%.\n\nWith this seed funding, Maviance will expand Smobilpay\u2019s national footprint in Cameroon to serve more consumers and to move into Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Maviance will be building new products but they won\u2019t go to market within the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cOur journey now is to become a regional company, providing cross-border services within the CEMAC region. We want to be a catalyst for interoperability,\u201d Cheambe says.\n\nHe adds that Maviance chose to go with MFS Africa because they bring money, industry knowledge, a product suite and a pan-African network of fintechs and businesses of various sizes to the table. The deal took over a year, from contact to close.\n\nThe appeal for both companies is to collaborate on building digital financial services in the Central African economic region\u2019s 6 countries: Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nMaviance was founded in Germany in 2008 by Jerry Cheambe and Michael Flach. They launched Maviance Cameroon in 2012, at a time when mobile money looked unlikely in the country.\n\n\u201cI remember saying at one point that mobile money will not work in Cameroon because it was just not happening,\u201d Cheambe says to TechCabal.\n\nTen years later, the landscape has improved enough for Maviance to be raising a large seed round.\n\n95% of Maviance Cameroon\u2019s 20-person staff are based in Cameroon. Cheambe is based in Germany where he oversees Maviance Germany, which operates independently of the Cameroonian venture.\n\nAnother strategic move by MFS Africa\n\nMFS Africa has been on a roll of deals over the last 12 months.\n\nIn June 2020, the South Africa-based company acquired Beyonic, a Tanzania-based payments company, in a cash and shares deal that paid out at least 4x returns for Beyonic\u2019s investors. Last month, MFS Africa led a $2.3 million seed round in Numida, a credit provider for small businesses in Uganda.\n\nWith Maviance in the mix, MFS Africa continues a conscious push to be Africa\u2019s largest hub for digital financial services.\n\nAs with the Beyonic deal, the Maviance team was in the process of raising money when MFS Africa approached.\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, says Maviance has been on MFS Africa\u2019s radar for some time. What convinced him to initiate investment conversations with Cheambe?\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of the asset \u2013 what they have built on the ground \u2013 the ability to work with them and the shared vision of the founder,\u201d Okoudjou says to TechCabal.\n\nMFS Africa was already present in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, working with mobile networks MTN and Airtel. But MFS Africa can rely on Maviance to cover the region and carry out integrations much faster.\n\nThough MFS Africa had scanned the market for other possible partners, the Maviance team had a long-term focus on building solid foundations. It is a minority investment but \u201cobviously both Jerry and I know that there is a possible path forward together,\u201d Okoudjou says.",

The launch of the new AppZone office follows a decade of stealth operations, as the company has diligently congregated some of Africa\u2019s best and brightest talents to build the de facto operating system for the continent\u2019s banking and financial services industry.\n\nThe launch of the new headquarters exemplifies AppZone\u2019s understanding of the need to ensure that home-grown talents are genuinely empowered and valued.

It\u2019s also in furtherance of AppZone\u2019s belief in maximizing local talent by rewarding and creating wealth whilst building and managing Africa\u2019s singular Financial Operating System.\n\nFounded in 2008, AppZone processes over $2 billion in transactions annually, serving 18 commercial banks and over 450 microfinance institutions across the continent.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s foremost fintech company, Global Accelerex (\u201cAccelerex\u201d), is creating exciting job opportunities for young and innovative Nigerians with a strong bias for technology, through its Accelerex Tech Open House. The first edition of the event held recently at Radisson Hotel, Ikeja, with the finest set of creative and brilliant software engineers and tech innovators in attendance.\n\nThe young, vibrant and smart-looking techies took turns to chat with the company\u2019s in-house assessors. This was followed by intense conversations and demos, as each of the participants displayed novel approaches to software design and development.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s objective for organizing the event, Executive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters, stressed that Accelerex\u2019s most valuable asset is its human resource. Therefore, it places the highest premium on attracting the best talents across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a Company, we know that there are Nigerian software engineers that can rival their counterparts around the globe, as recent developments in the fintech space have shown. A critical part of our effort to strengthen the digital economy is the creation of this platform where outstanding individuals can showcase their skills and can join the Technology Team at Accelerex. We believe that the next big names in the technology space will come out of Africa, and we are providing the breeding ground for them,\u201d Mr. Peters stated.\n\nExecutive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters\n\n\n\nThe Head, Human Resources, Mr. Rowland Ogbonda, pointed out that the company is expanding the frontiers and setting a new benchmark in the Nigerian fintech space by giving unrivalled opportunities to highly skilled tech talents with non-traditional education to join its workforce and become part of a team that is solving real-life problems for its target markets.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are many talented innovators and software engineers with disruptive ideas that they are eager to unleash. Therefore, we have scrapped the university degree requirement, and are prioritizing technical depth and capabilities above years of experience for tech candidates, even as we try to champion inclusion in our recruitment process. With our culture of continuous learning, improvement and upskilling, successful attendees would certainly realise their full potential with us\u201d, Mr. Ogbonda added.\n\nFurther buttressing this position, Head, Enterprise Technology Solutions, Mr. Lanre Afodunrinbi, disclosed that the company\u2019s expansion to other parts of Africa made it necessary to beef up the Technology Team to continually deliver superior solutions to its different markets.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the youths and are giving them an opportunity to expand their knowledge and capabilities by selecting the smartest among them to leverage our African expansion and other growth initiatives. This will expose, challenge and motivate them to seek far-reaching solutions to perennial payment problems. Through this, we are also contributing to the economy and reducing the unemployment figures in Nigeria. Initiatives like our open house will go a long way towards curbing brain drain, as young and tech-savvy Nigerians will no longer jump on the next flight in search of greener pastures, when they can have the same opportunities here\u201d, Mr. Afodunrinbi concluded.\n\nAt the end of the session, participants were given a dose of Accelerex\u2019s hospitality, and were treated to upscale dining, gift packs and a free ride to and from the venue. The event gave prospective talents an immersive experience of the Accelerex culture in a warm, relaxed and engaging environment, which made the company an attractive career choice for them.\n\nAccelerex is renowned for its pedigree in innovation, world-class technology, excellent customer service and a commitment to provide fintech solutions that evolve with customers\u2019 needs across Africa. The company has set itself apart as a great place to work with a meaningful set of values that have defined its culture and helped cultivate an environment that embraces diversity and promotes ingenuity.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew Episode!

Justice Esohe Ikponmwen from the state\u2019s public service.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cWe have been very consistent, as a government, about the judiciary. The Judiciary is the anchor on which our democracy rests and as such must be treated and given its due place in our democracy.\n\n\u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to cover more grounds as desired in terms of judiciary transformation in Edo State.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nGovernors of the 17 states of Nigeria under the aegis of Southern Governors Forum (SGF), have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation over rising spate of insecurity in the country, just as they decried increasing incursion into the region by militant herdsmen.\n\nThe governors who made the demand in a communique issued at the end of their meeting in Asaba, Delta State capital on Tuesday, also urged the Federal Government to initiate a national dialogue as a matter of urgency and insisted on the ban of open grazing across Southern Nigeria\n\nThe governors in the 12 point communique read by the Chairman of Southern Governors Forum, Governor Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, \u201caffirmed that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nThe governors said they have, \u201cObserved that the incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria; noted that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South.\n\n\u201cGiven this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South (including cattle movement to the South by foot); recommended that the Federal Government should support willing States to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\n\u201cAgreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism.\n\n\u201cRecommended that in view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency; recommended that in deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government Agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect the federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogenous.\n\n\u201cResolved to foster cooperation among the Southern States and the nation at large; expressed concern on the continued gridlock on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway and the chokehold it has exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.\n\n\u201cThe meeting, therefore, recommended the activation and establishment of ports in other states of the federation to create new jobs and promote socio-economic activities in the country; the meeting expressed concern on the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and therefore suggested greater coordination and cooperation between Federal and State Governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cExpressed very grave concern on the security challenges currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people; and expressed gratitude to our host, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for his generosity and hospitality\u201d.\n\nThose in attendance are the host, Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta; his Enugu State counterpart, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi; Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, Willi Obiano of Anambra, Douye Diri of Bayelsa, Godwin Obaseki of Edo and David Umehi of Ebonyi.\n\nOthers are: Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, Seyi Makinde of Oyo, Nyesom Wike of Rivers.\n\nWhile Hope Uzodimma of Imo was represented by his deputy, Prof Placcid Njoku, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa-Ibom by his Deputy, Mr Moses Ekpo, while Governors Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and Ben Ayade of Cross River State were absent",

Sahara Reporters of May 8 elaborated on the new secret plan, which, by the grace of God, has come to the public domain. The report further revealed that the exercise would commence from Orlu in Imo State. This is very disturbing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of deployment of northern military officers to the South East lends credence to the above report. Sahara Reporters revealed that in preparation for the above, the Nigerian army has posted Northern Muslims as commanders over its operations and brigades in Anambra, Imo, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Benue, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra, the Cantonment Commandant of the 302 Artillery Regiment, Onitsha is Col. Abdulsalam Sambo, a northern Muslim; in Imo, the Commander of 34 Brigade, Obinze, is Brig-Gen. Ibrahim Tukura, another northerner; in Abia, the Commander of 14 Brigade, Ohafia, is Brig-Gen M. Ibrahim, a northerner; while in Akwa Ibom, the Commander of 2 Brigade, Uyo, is Brig-Gen. Faruk Mijinyawa, another northerner. This is truly worrisome!\u201d\n\nPresident-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Professor George Obiozor, had admonished the Nigerian government to learn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism, but seek possible peaceful options that guarantee national unity and peaceful coexistence.\n\nObiozor, according to the group, lamented: \u201cSubnational consciousness or ethnocentric nationalism, which is a dangerous form of nationalism to national unity has taken over Nigeria. The dream of Nigeria\u2019s unity is receding fast with violence, crises and conflicts.\u201d\n\nOgbonnia stated that Ndigbo were unequivocal that the current problems confronting Nigeria were a product of sustained orchestrated injustice in governance.\n\nOhanaeze urged the Federal Government to refrain from the use of force in resolving the present national crises.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that military and violent means to solve the national question is bound to fail, as it leads to further national fractionalisation, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration, as in all empires or multi-national states or countries,\u201d it added.",

          "text": "Achieving qualitative education in Nigeria would be a mirage if the teaching profession is not in good shape. In this report, DOOSUUR IWAMBE, examines how the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria is transforming the profession through innovation.\n\nIt is no longer news that most developed countries usually trace their roots of success in all sectors to the quality of their teaching profession.\n\nThe long chain of all other professions like medicine, law and engineering originate from the teaching profession. However, the reverse is the case in Nigeria, as teaching is being seen as the last resort for academic losers.\n\nSome people even refer to teachers as substitutes on the bench of life, who are left with no option than to proceed and be employed into the teaching profession.\n\nTeachers\u2019 condition of service in Nigeria lacks adequate incentives to attract and retain the best brains in Nigerian schools.\n\nThe dwindling attraction to the teaching profession, and by extension the resultant low enrollment in the teacher education programs are traceable to the relatively low social status of teachers with accompanying psychological impacts.\n\nConsequently, within the remaining pool, some teachers either seek opportunities in other sectors (within the economy) with better service incentives or even migrate to other countries where teachers\u2019 conditions of service are much better, in search of greener pastures.\n\nThe quality or standard of education in Nigeria has reduced in recent years because of, among other factors, the brain drain phenomenon, (i.e., the drift of many brilliant, intelligent and more experienced teachers and university lecturers to countries where they were offered better remunerations and conditions of service).\n\nThis, to a large extent, is attributable to inadequate incentives, poorly equipped education system in an increasingly hostile working environment, inadequate social recognition, delay in payment (and sometimes denial) of teachers\u2019 salaries, among others.\n\nThe reliance on inexperienced, and in some cases unqualified teachers in the various educational fields and institutions in the country definitely affects the quality of students\u2019 work, and of graduates who are eventually employed to service the educational workers\u2019 needs, as well as the economy.\n\nThis vicious circle contributes to the lowering status of education in the universities, colleges of education as well as secondary and primary schools even as the trend impacts on the economy negatively.\n\nTRCN innovations changing the narrative\n\nTo change the narrative and make the teaching profession attractive as w put it at par with global standards, the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) under the leadership of its Registrar, Professor Josiah Ajiboye, has embarked on some innovative measures that are silently transforming the profession.\n\nFor instance, the council set up a taskforce to crackdown on unqualified teachers across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nAjiboye explained that the enforcement and monitoring of compliance with its directive was to ensure that only qualified professionals licensed by TRCN should teach in public and private schools nationwide.\n\nAjiboye, who maintained that no serious country allows her future leaders to be miseducated by quacks, stated that the Buhari-led administration is determined to have professional teachers given necessary tools to excel.\n\n\u201cTRCN commences compliance monitoring across the country. As the December 31, 2019 deadline given by the National Council on Education for anybody who wants to practise as a teacher in the country to get qualified, registered and licensed by TRCN has passed, the regulatory authority is embarking on verification of compliance in all the states of the federation and FCT.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is, however, put on hold in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states due to the challenges there. The TRCN team in each State will be led by a Professor of Education or a Provost of a College of Education.\n\nThe first leg of the exercise will start on the 9th of March and end on the 17th.\n\n\u201cHowever this exercise will be a continuous one as TRCN has created a Compliance and Enforcement Unit at its head office for routine monitoring.\n\n\u201cPrior to the commencement of the monitoring, a technical team was set up by TRCN and a meeting was held with all the state coordinators, where issues of logistics were discussed and harmonised,\u201d the TRCN Registrar said.\n\nProf Ajiboye also took exception to state governments that have been recruiting teachers and treating TRCN certification or license as optional, as he reiterated that a TRCN certification is mandatory in order to be considered employable as a teacher.\n\n\u201cTRCN takes exception to some states making the TRCN Certificate optional in their recruitment of teachers.\n\nThis practice must stop because it is mandatory for anyone who wants to profit from the job of a teacher to be registered with the regulatory authority.\n\nIt is therefore considered absurd for any state to say \u2018TRCN Certificate will be an added advantage\u2019.\n\nWhereas that is supposed to be the number one criterion. This is the global best practice.\n\n\u201cThere is no serious nation that would allow just anybody into its classrooms to teach their children. There must be evidence of professional certification to practice as a teacher,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking recently during a one-day Capacity Training Workshop, it organized for Education Correspondents Association of Nigeria (ECAN) in Abuja, Prof Ajiboye disclosed that Nigerian Teachers are now being sought after globally.\n\nHe said that he has signed about 100 letters of Professional for qualified Nigerian teachers who secured teaching jobs in Canada and other parts of the world since the beginning of the year 2021.\n\nWhile stressing that teachers trained in Nigeria are becoming highly competitive, he added that governments at all levels should work hard to attract them to stay back home.\n\nAjiboye emphasized the approvals given by President Muhammadu Buhari, on repositioning teaching profession in the country.\n\nHe also called for adherence by the State governments as they are the largest employers of teachers in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr President started with that in 2020, if we can be able to follow through this, I believe very strongly that the trend of our teachers leaving the country will reduce.\n\n\u201cAt the Federal Ministry of Education level, the circular has gone out on 65years of teacher\u2019s retirement, Federal teachers will benefit from this beginning from January 2021, some of the approval will wait till 2022 but we will continue with the implementation\u201d.\n\nHe assured that with the approvals given by the President and with it full implementation across the country with the cooperation of states, more qualified teachers will be retained in the system.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our qualified teachers to leave Nigeria but for those that are leaving, they are being rated at par with their colleagues abroad\u201d.\n\nAjiboye, who further noted that it was getting practically impossible to get a teaching job without being registered and licensed, however, said that the country would only develop positively when the right calibre of teachers were engaged to impact learning in schools. \u201cIf we want to get it right in Nigeria, we must get the issues of the teachers\u2019 right.\n\n\u2018\u2019A situation where anyone whether qualified or unqualified is free to stand in front of a classroom to teach is sheet anarchy and Nigeria is already paying a big price for neglect of the sector.\u201d\n\nAjiboye said the next step on line was to secure the approval of the Federal Executive Council, adding that the National Assembly was also expected to intervene in amending relevant laws to allow the increase in service and retirement years for teachers.\n\nThe TRCN boss further commended Buhari; the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu; and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, for their support to the teaching profession.\n\nThe TRCN\u2019s Assistant Director, Research and Statistics, Dr. Magaji Waziri in his presentation at the workshop explained that the approved document on career path policy for teachers had also been approved by the National Council on Education, and already awaiting the buy-in by relevant stakeholders for implementation.\n\nHe also called on the federal government to make education course compulsory for all the universities in the country.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Chairman of ECAN, Chuks Ukwuatu, called on journalists to ensure adequate reportage of education to foster development in other sectors.\n\nUkwuatu commended TRCN for its role in ensuring excellence in the education, professionalism of teachers, as well a maintenance of teachers\u2019 quality.\n\nHe also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to renew the appointment of the TRCN boss to ensure continuity in transforming the nation\u2019s teaching profession.\n\nThe Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) is a statutory body established by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria Act 1993. The council is an agency under the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nThe TRCN Act declares that the purpose of the Act is to establish the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, which has the duty of determining the standards of knowledge and skill to be attained by persons seeking to become registered as teachers and for related matters.\n\nThe TRCN is a statutory regulatory body which regulates the teaching profession and teachers at all levels of the Nigerian Education system. A regulatory body is a statutory establishment charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with the requirement of the law.\n\nIt generally has the duties of accrediting, recognising and approving persons and organisations which fall under the purview of its control.",

          "text": "By Tunde Opalana\n\nNigerian Women Elders Council at a world press conference in Abuja on Tuesday said the safety of President Muhammadu Buhari can no longer be guaranteed if robbers can break into the fortress of the Aso Rock Presidential Villa to burgle homes of top aides of the President.\n\nThe council insisted that convocation of another national conference is necessary to address myriads of problems heightened by security challenges that threatens the unity of the country.\n\nAddressing the press on behalf of the women body, a former Works Commissioner in Anambra State, Chief Mrs Chika Ibeleme categorically stated that \u201d if houses of highly placed officials in the Presidency can be burgled by robbers, then President Muhammadu Buhari can be kidnapped\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat means that nobody is safe again in this country. So, President Buhari need to come out and address the nation to allay our fears\u201d.\n\nThe Council said \u201cNigeria is currently at crossroads and the country\u2019s unity is being questioned by the very happenings across every section. At no time have our fault lines been this visible.\n\n\u201cAll geopolitical zones are engulfed in one crisis or the other with lives and property being threatened on a daily basis with insecurity at its peak\u201d.\n\nRejecting the trend of the nation approaching state of anomy, the council said \u201cif not checked, we as mother\u2019s fear that Nigeria may implode sooner than later. A situation where security agencies seem overwhelmed such that foreigners take advantage of the situation to wreak havoc on the country is unacceptable to Nigerian women\u201d.\n\nThey, therefore called on government to convene a National Conference where Nigerians from all walks of life and the different sections can have the opportunity to ventilate their grievances (if any) or express their views on the situation of the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: Shehu Sani shares lesson as Boko Haram distributes food to Borno, Yobe residents\n\nThe Women Elders Council was of the opinion that the conference will also afford the government the opportunity to bring every section together towards a lasting solution to the myriads of problems confronting the nation.\n\nOn why another conference despite past conferences held in the country, the council said it will address peculiar issues not addressed by previous roundtables.\n\n\u201cYou may ask \u201canother conference?\u201d. And we say \u201cyes\u201d because there are fresh challenges that have come up in the last six years which the other conferences may not have envisaged and addressed.\n\n\u201cWe hereby put the Federal Government in notice that after two months of this call for a National Conference, if nothing is done, Nigerian Women Elders Council will commence a two week fasting and prayers to seek divine intervention and guidance for further action.\n\n\u201cAfter communing with God Almighty,we will lead Nigeria women on a nationwide peaceful protest.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, if government remains adamant, Nigerian Women Elders Council will lead Nigerians in a sit \u2013 at -home action until the Nigerian government and the political class convene a National Conference and agree on workable solutions to the numerous challenges bedeviling the country.\n\n*Nigerian Women Elders Council is tired of watching precious Nigerian lives being wasted on a daily basis as Nigeria as a nation reaches a tipping point and our children are used as pawns in the hands of power seekers.

The first step is to tone down the rhetoric.\n\nREAD ALSO: Security Intervention: Southern Governors Meet In Asaba\n\n\u201cNow, there is a growing dangerous trend which I will like to comment on. It is the practice of launching deadly attacks against the nation\u2019s security personnel. Soldiers as well as police, customs, and other security agents have been killed and maimed in some parts of the country in this growing trend of targeting security forces.\n\n\u201cI want to say, unequivocally, that any attack on our security men and women is an attack on the state and a declaration of war against the nation. It follows, therefore, that this will be countered with overwhelming force.\u201d\n\nNigeria has been experiencing a series of security threats ranging from terrorism, banditry, militancy, cultism among others in several parts of the country.\n\nThe country has been battling terrorism for more than a decade which has killed 36,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands in the northeast.\n\nThe Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) split from the jihadist group Boko Haram in 2016 and has since become a dominant threat in Nigeria, attacking troops and bases while killing and kidnapping passengers at bogus checkpoints.\n\nOn March 1, jihadist fighters burnt down a United Nations humanitarian compound in the town of Dikwa after dislodging troops, killing six civilians.\n\nNigeria\u2019s jihadist violence has spread to neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger, prompting a regional military coalition to fight the insurgents.",

Development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South. Given this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South \u2013 including cattle movement to the South by foot.\u201d\n\nThe governors also urged the federal government to support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nFollowing several agitations by various groups in the country, the southern governors called on the federal government to take bold steps in restructuring the country.\n\n\u201cThe progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism,\u201d the governors said.\n\n\u201cIn view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government Agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogeneous.\n\nThe governors also called for the creation of more ports in the country to reduce the burden on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway being the sole outlet from the Apapa Wharf.\n\n\u201cThe continued gridlock on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway and the chokehold it has exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.
