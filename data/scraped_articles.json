          "title": "How we were kidnapped behind police station \u2013Enugu estate agents",
          "text": "Two Enugu-based estate agents \u2013 Mazi Uchechukwugeme Abonyi and Aja Uchenna Michael \u2013 tell RAPHAEL EDE about their four-day ordeal in the den of Fulani kidnappers\n\nWhat is your name and what do you do for a living?\n\nMy name is Mazi Uchechukwugeme Abonyi. I am a real estate agent.\n\nYou and two others were kidnapped sometime last month. Can you us how it happened?\n\nIn the morning of April 9, 2021 I went to Amokpo Nike with two of my friends, Uche Aja and Emeka Ijegara, to inspect a piece of land for a client. The land is at the back of Unity Police Station opposite Elime Estate Enugu. We had inspected and videoed the 10 plots of land and were about to leave around 9.30am, when I saw about five heavily-armed guys running towards us.\n\nIn shock, I shouted, \u2018Jesus!\u2019 They told me that if I moved they would \u2018pin me to the ground with a bullet.\u2019 But I started running and suddenly felt something hit me and I fell down. I saw my friend, Uche Aja, fighting with one of them but they stabbed him. Eventually, they brought the three of us together and began to march us away. We were made to trek and jog in the thick forest for about six hours non-stop. The forest was so thick, one could hardly see the sky. I have heard of Sambisa forest in the North, but I never knew there is a forest like that in Enugu. We were climbing and descending from mountains. From around 9.30am when the journey began we didn\u2019t stop moving until about 3pm. Meanwhile, these guys were beating and pushing us to run. Whenever we said we were tired and wanted to rest, they hit us with their guns. It was a terrible experience. When we finally stopped moving, they ordered us to lie down.\n\nWhat happened afterwards?\n\nThey gave us our phones, which they had earlier collected. They said we were going to a mountain to make calls to our people and inform them that we had been kidnapped. They said we should tell our people that they would pay a ransom of N7m on each of us. When they said that, we began to cry. We told them our people had no such money and we were guys just struggling to survive, working as real estate agents. They said that was none of their business; it was either N7m each or our lives.\n\nThey ordered us to start moving again. We got to a very big river and they told us that was where they killed people and threw their body inside water if their relatives failed to respond fast enough.\n\nAt that point we were made to call our people. We were made to tell our people to be fast in bringing the money as the kidnappers had shown us where they killed people when there was a delay in the payment of ransom.\n\nWere your families able to raise the money?\n\nYes, but they negotiated and agreed on N2m.\n\nHow was the ransom delivered to the kidnappers?\n\nWhere they kept us was about eight hours\u2019 walk to from the main road. After our families finally raised the money and arranged for someone to bring it, the kidnappers moved us closer to the main road. They ordered us to lie down on the ground while two of them went to collect the ransom from the person bringing it. The two leaders instructed the remaining three others they left with us to kill us if they didn\u2019t return. But they returned shortly later and one of two asked us, \u2018Who is Uche Abonyi among you?\u2019 I indicated I was the one, thinking that our people had paid the ransom and it was time for me and my friends to go. But he ordered me to move aside and lie down. He said he would shoot me for inviting the DSS and police anti-kidnap unit. He said policemen could have killed him if not that they were clumsy in their shootings. He said since he escaped being killed, he would kill me and send my dead body to my brother to teach him a lesson not to call the police next time.\n\nWhat did you do when he said that?\n\nI started pleading with him, asking him to give me another chance. I begged the guy to forgive my brother. I said my brother could not have brought the police to attack him. I tried everything to convince him not to kill me. After some time, he said I had only one chance to get someone else to deliver the money to them. He said he didn\u2019t know why something was telling him not to shoot me because the normal thing they did if anyone called the police for them was to kill the victim. He said in my case something was telling him not to shoot me. I pleaded with him to please listen to that thing and spare my life.\n\nI asked my friend, Emeka, to make the call and arrange for someone else, who knows the terrain, to bring the ransom. It was that person who brought the ransom to them. They freed us to go after they got the ransom.\n\n\u2018We drank only water for four days in kidnappers\u2019 den\u2019\n\nWhat is your name?\n\nMy name is Aja Uchenna Michael\n\nCan you briefly narrate your encounter with the kidnappers?\n\nAs my friend had said, we were abducted around 9am on Friday, April 9 when we went to inspect a piece of land. When I heard him (Abonyi) shout \u2018Jesus!\u2019 I was shocked and asked him what happened. On turning around, I saw a Fulani man carrying an AK-47 rifle, running towards us. Out of fear we dispersed, running in different directions. Little did we know that they (kidnappers) were five in number and they had already taken positions. As I was running, I tripped over something and fell down. I stood up and continued running and then I noticed that someone was chasing me. The person overtook me, pointed a pistol at me and ordered me to go back. I was scared. When he saw that I wasn\u2019t moving, he brought out his machete and started swinging it in my face. As I was telling him I couldn\u2019t go back there, he hit me twice on the hand with the machete. I had to start defending myself.\n\nI rushed at him and started struggling with him for the control of the gun. As we were both struggling, one of the gang members came and pointed his gun to my head. So, at that point, I had to surrender, seeing they had overpowered me.\n\nThey took me to where they kept my friends and started threatening to kill us. They pointed at me particularly, saying they would kill me for attacking their brother. They took our wallets, removed our money and returned the wallets to us. Then they marched us into the forest. We walked inside the forest for over six hours non-stop. The kidnappers must have been on drugs because we couldn\u2019t keep up with their pace and they kept hitting us with machete, knife, anything in their hands. The funny thing is that these people know the terrain too well. It is like they demarcated area and avoided paths that might lead to where people are. They were communicating among themselves by whistling. We were completely in the thick forest and we couldn\u2019t even see the sky.\n\nWhat did they do to you in the forest?\n\nAfter we stopped moving in the evening and they ordered us to call our people, they led us to a different location where we could get water. We drink the water there happily because we were highly dehydrated already. In the night, we slept in the forest. And then the next morning, as early as 4am, they woke us up and moved us to another location. As a matter of fact, we never spent more than three hours in a particular location. That shows you how professional these people are.\n\nWere you fed by the kidnappers?\n\nThey didn\u2019t give us anything like food or snacks for the four days that we were in their den. We were just drinking water \u2013 we drank whatever water we could find for those four days.\n\nIf you are given security, can you trace the place in the forest where you were kept for those four days?\n\nNo. We were not kept in a single location to start with. And if they had left us in that forest to find our way out, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out by ourselves.\n\nHow do you know that your kidnappers were Fulani?\n\nThey spoke Fulani (language), they dressed like Fulani people. I grew up in a place where some Fulani people settled; so, I know them when I see them.\n\nWhat type of guns did they carry?\n\nThey carried military-like guns. I saw AK-49 and pump-action guns \u2013 very heavy weapons. They also had daggers and machetes.\n\nAre you by any means saying that those kidnappers might have military background?\n\nI don\u2019t know how they came across those weapons and I don\u2019t think they were soldiers; but then I know that for them to access those weapons, they must either have connections in high places or they killed military personnel and collected their rifles.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Parents of the remaining kidnapped students of the Greenfield University, Kaduna in bandits\u2019 captivity have begged the Federal Government to rescue their children, saying the bandits refused to release the students after paying N60m ransom.\n\nThey claimed they could no longer meet the latest demand of N160m cumulative ransom by the bandits.\n\nThe students abducted by the bandits on April 20, 2021 at the school located along the Kaduna-Abuja highway have spent at least 24 days in captivity.\n\nFew days after their abduction, the bandits killed five of the 23 students for failure to pay N800m they demanded as ransom.\n\nAlso, the bandits\u2019 leader, Sani Jalingo, in an interview on the Hausa Service of the Voice of America, vowed to kill the remaining students if the parents failed to bring N100m and 10 motorcycles.\n\nBut the bandits rescinded their threat upon the intervention of the controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of other parents in Kaduna on Thursday, Chairman of the aggrieved parents, Marcus Zarmai, begged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to use his good offices to ensure the safe return of their children from the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits are now demanding a ransom of N160m with each of the parents expected to contribute N10m for the remaining 16 students.\n\nThis, he said, was after the parents had contributed over N60m to the bandits for the release of their children without result.\n\n\u201cWe, the parents, are appealing to the Federal Government to assist us to pay the ransom demanded or find any other way to ensure the safe return of our children.\n\n\u201cThe same strategy that was adopted to rescue the kidnapped students in Jangebe, Zamfara State, Kankara in Katsina State, Kagara in Niger State and Afaka in Kaduna State should be adopted by the Federal Government to rescue our children too because they are also Nigerians,\u201d he added.\n\nEaster Chukwuemeka, whose mother was among those kidnapped by the bandits, also called on the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency intervene as the absence of their children had impacted negatively on them.\n\nAmong the remaining 16 persons in the bandits\u2019 den are 13 students and three female workers of the university.\n\nNAF jet pounds bandits\u2019 hideouts, kills scores in Kaduna forests \u2013Official\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force component of the Operation Thunder Strike has bombarded bandits\u2019 hideouts in different locations in four local government areas in Kaduna, including Chikun, Kajuru, Kachia, and Birnin Gwari, reportedly killing scores of bandits.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan, who confirmed this, however, did not mention the day the operations were carried out.\n\nHe said the operations were as reported to the state government by the NAF.\n\nAccording to Aruwan, armed reconnaissance was conducted over Erena, Kusasu, Kuduru, Kulefe, Kusherki and Shiroro in neighbouring Niger State, as well as Chikun and its environs in Chikun LGA.\n\nHe said, \u201cBandits were seen fleeing the Kaduna State part of Kusasu (in Chikun LGA) on motorcycles. They were trailed by the crew and subsequently neutralised.\n\n\u201cFollowing this, armed reconnaissance was conducted along the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway, Olam Farms, Rugu, Akilbu, Polewire Rijana, Katari, Jere and adjoining settlements.\n\n\u201cNormal human activities and free flow of traffic were observed along the highway and rail line. All locations scanned were reported calm with no threats observed.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the commissioner noted that strike aircraft carried out operations over Jan Birni, Birnin Gwari LGA, which he said was observed to be active with bandits, noting that some bandits were taken out and the camp set ablaze and destroyed.\n\nAruwan added that the air operations, including air interdiction, armed reconnaissance and patrols, would be sustained in the coming days over Kaduna metropolis and other areas of interest in the state.\n\n\u201cMajor highways will also be covered, including the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari, Kaduna-Abuja, Kaduna-Zaria, Kaduna-Kachia and Kaduna-Afaka roads. Receiving the feedback, Governor Nasir el-Rufai commended the crews for the successful missions, and thanked them for their proactive operations,\u201d he stated.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday urged some countries to reconsider vaccinating their children and adolescents, calling on them to donate vaccines to COVAX for equitable distribution to low-income countries.\n\nWHO Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, made the appeal at a news conference on COVID-19 at the UN health agency\u2019s headquarters in Geneva.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the U.S. had on Thursday started vaccinating adolescents from ages 12 to 15.\n\nVaccinating younger ages is considered an important step for getting children back into schools safely.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has asked states to make the vaccine available to younger adolescents immediately.\n\nThe director-general, however, said a handful of rich countries, which bought up the majority of the vaccine supply, lower-risk groups had been vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI understand why some countries want to vaccinate their children and adolescents, but right now I urge them to reconsider and to instead donate vaccines to COVAX.\n\n\u201cBecause in low and lower-middle-income countries, vaccine supply has not been enough to even immunize health and care workers, and hospitals are being inundated with people that need lifesaving care urgently.\n\n\u201cAt present, only 0.3 per cent of vaccine supply is going to low-income countries; trickle-down vaccination is not an effective strategy for fighting a deadly respiratory virus,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGhebreyesus said that India remained a source of concern, with several states continuing to see a worrying number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\n\u201cWHO is responding and has shipped thousands of oxygen concentrators, tents for mobile field hospitals, masks, and other medical supplies. And we thank all the stakeholders who are supporting India.\n\n\u201cBut it is not only India that has emergency needs.\n\n\u201cNepal, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Egypt are just some of the countries that are dealing with spikes in cases and hospitalizations,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, some countries in the Americas still have high numbers of cases and as a region, the Americas accounted for 40 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths last week.\n\n\u201cThere are also spikes in some countries in Africa.\n\n\u201cThese countries are in heightened response mode and WHO will continue to provide support in all ways possible.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has already cost more than 3.3 million lives and we\u2019re on track for the second year of this pandemic to be far more deadly than the first.\n\n\u201cSaving lives and livelihoods with a combination of public health measures and vaccination \u2013 not one or the other \u2013 is the only way out of the pandemic.\u2019\u2019\n\nGhebreyesus said vaccine supply remained a key challenge, but this week I have been pleased to see leaders and manufacturers working to address some of these issues.\n\nFirst, he said there have been a number of new country announcements about sharing vaccines with COVAX, which is the fastest way to ensure equitable rollout of vaccines.\n\n\u201cSecond, new deals involving tech-transfer and sharing of know-how between international manufacturers to scale up vaccine production have been announced.\n\n\u201cAnd third, leaders including the Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, have called for all trade barriers to be lifted as soon as possible,\u2019\u2019 the director-general said.\n\nIn addition, he said WHO had again convened researchers and scientists from around the world to update the Research and Innovation Roadmap to take stock of what we\u2019ve learned and identify the most pressing knowledge gaps.\n\nThe director-general said it was amazing how far the world had come in less than 18 months, saying,\u201c I have high hopes that breakthrough innovation will continue at record pace.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The recent COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the Federal Government has continued to spark reactions from concerned Nigerians and stakeholders.\n\nThe reinstatement of curfew and other restrictions across the nation is coming on the heels of insecurity which recently escalated to all regions of the country.\n\nBanditry, kidnapping, herdsmen attacks and the activities of \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 in both the South-East and South-South have relatively \u2018drained the glory\u2019 of Nigeria as both civilians and security operatives are killed helplessly.\n\nAmid the security crisis, the Federal Government on Monday announced a fresh COVID-19 restriction, hitherto imposed to curtail the spread of the virus in the country.\n\nBoss Mustapha, who is the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, during the briefing of the task force in Abuja, announced the closure of all bars, nightclubs, pubs and event centres, as well as recreational centres in all states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAll restaurants were also directed to close, except those providing services to hotel residents, takeaways, home deliveries, and drive-ins.\n\nSimilarly, all informal and formal festivity events, including weddings, conferences, congresses, office parties, concerts, seminars, sporting activities, end of year events, have been restricted to not more than 50 people.\n\nThis, to some Nigerians, is fresh nationwide lockdown which according to some, would further worsen the already \u2018depressed\u2019 economy.\n\nMeanwhile, some have questioned the move by the Federal Government to impose a fresh lock down, citing the COVID-19 vaccination which is currently ongoing in many parts of the country.\n\nRecall that Nigeria on March 1st, took delivery of nearly four million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as part of an overall 16 million doses planned to be delivered to the country in batches within the year.\n\nUpon arrival, samples were handed to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) for further examination, after which the agency certified the vaccines safe and effective for use, according to Nigerian\u2019s Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire.\n\nThe Federal Government subsequently commenced the COVID-19 vaccination, beginning with healthcare workers who are often at the risk of exposure to infections being the first responders to patients.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the vaccination exercise has continued across the country since President Muhammadu Buhari and his vice, Professor Yemi Osinbajo took their jabs on March 6 on live camera.\n\nSome concerned Nigerians who spoke with DAILY POST correspondent lamented the new restriction, stressing that the Federal Government was expected to focus on tackling the security crisis which has claimed several lives in less than three months instead of fresh lockdown.\n\nAn event manager in the Federal Capital Territory, Agbo Mathew Adah, said the restriction would impose more hardship on Nigerians owing to the current economic situation birthed by insecurity.\n\n\u201cLast year, there was a total lockdown due to COVID-19 which held the world hostage, this year, since January, it has been killings upon killings and the hardship is even worse than it was in 2020.\n\n\u201cSo are they trying to combine the 2020 predicament to what we are already facing? I don\u2019t think it will work.\n\n\u201cIf the government care about the citizens as they claim, they should be more concerned about how we feed and survive in the face of this horrible hardship.\n\n\u201cHerdsmen have taken over farmlands and we cannot afford the usual two square meals. Visit the market and you will understand the plight of the common Nigerian.\n\nA member of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, Benue State University Chapter who preferred not to be mentioned, told DAILY POST that some of the restrictions, particularly the 50 persons per gathering may not work.\n\n\u201cIt is better they shut down the system as they did in 2020. You can\u2019t introduce such restriction in a university like ours where population is always a challenge.\n\n\u201cHow do you deliver your lecture to a class of over 700 students if you are to follow such restriction? It\u2019s practically impossible.\n\n\u201cHow many of the students even believe in the COVID-19 stories? We force them most times to observe the protocols.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t allow anyone into my class without a face mask which at least can help contain the spread. But population is always our challenge.\n\nA student of the University of Abuja, Mary Chukwu, said the COVID-19 story \u201cis a scam\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is like the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has gone out of cash, so they need to bring back the story.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Federal Government is bringing this up at this time when insecurity has taken over the nation. How many people have died due to the virus since 2020 compared to the lives lost in just a few months due to security crisis?\n\n\u201cThe earlier we stop deceiving ourselves and face what is facing us, the best for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, efforts by DAILY POST correspondent to reach officials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, went unsuccessful as at press time.\n\nHowever, a health worker, Mercy Onuh who spoke with a DAILY POST correspondent from Lokoja, the Kogi State capital said the new directive may not be unconnected to the Indian COVID-19 strain which was recently discovered in Nigeria.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the FG a few days ago disclosed that the dreaded COVID-19 strain, which is currently ravaging India, was found in Nigeria.\n\nThe strain was reportedly detected by the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in the Redeemers University, Ede, Osun State\n\nSpeaking further, the COVID-19 frontline nurse, said the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control was being proactive to ensure the new variant is contained.\n\n\u201cThis Indian COVID-19 variant is correctly dealing with them there. They record no fewer than 4,000 deaths daily.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want such \u2018hell\u2019 to befall the nation, so I applaud the NCDC for acting fast to prevent this dangerous disease from spreading forth.\n\nWhen asked why such a reaction should be in place despite the vaccines available, she said \u201cthat you have been vaccinated is not a guarantee that you cannot spread the virus.\n\n\u201cBesides, how many Nigerians have taken the vaccines? Just a few persons besides health workers. It may be shocking to tell you that some health workers don\u2019t believe in this vaccine due to religious influence.\u201d",

          "text": "The World Bank has said that remittance inflow to Nigeria declined by 28 per cent in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe bank added that remittance flows fell for Sub-Saharan Africa by 12.5 per cent, according to its Migration and Development Brief 33 Phase 11 entitled: \u201cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\u2019\u2019 published on Thursday.\n\nThe report said the decline in remittance flows to Nigeria was largely responsible for the fall in remittance flows to sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThe decline in flows to sub-Saharan Africa was almost entirely due to a 28 per cent decline in remittance flows to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cExcluding flows to Nigeria, remittances to sub-Saharan Africa increased by 2.3 per cent, demonstrating resilience,\u2019\u2019 the report stated.\n\nAccording to the report, the relatively strong performance of remittance flows during the COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted the importance of timely availability of data.\n\nIt stated that given its growing significance as a source of external financing for low and middle-income countries, there was need for better collection of data on remittances.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt emphasised that there was need for better collection of data on remittances, in terms of frequency, timely reporting, and granularity by corridor and channel.\n\nWith global growth expected to rebound further in 2021 and 2022, remittance flows to low and middle- income countries are expected to increase by 2.6 per cent to 553 billion dollars in 2021 and by 2.2 per cent to 565 billion dollars in 2022.\n\nThe report stated that global average cost of sending $200 remained high at 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020, more than double the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target of three per cent.\n\nIt stated that sub-Saharan Africa continued to have the highest average cost (8.2 per cent) adding that supporting the remittance infrastructure and keeping remittances flowing includes efforts to lower fees.\n\nThe true size of remittances, which includes formal and informal flows, is believed to be larger than officially reported data, though the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on informal flows is unclear.\n\n\u201cAs COVID-19 still devastates families around the world, remittances continue to provide a critical lifeline for the poor and vulnerable,\u201d said Michal Rutkowski, Global Director of the Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice at the World Bank.\n\n\u201cSupportive policy responses, together with national social protection systems, should continue to be inclusive of all communities, including migrants,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Seyi Tinubu: My passion, pains as Asiwaju\u2019s son",
          "text": "By Funsho Arogundade\n\nOluwaseyi Afolabi Tinubu is the eldest son of the former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Recently, some outdoor advertising practitioners alleged that the Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) is shielding his business interests. Seyi Tinubu runs Loatsad Promomedia Limited, a new digital and outdoor advertising agency. Aside from having exclusive rights on some major roads in Lagos, he is said to enjoy unbridled freedomn. In this interview in his Lekki, Lagos office, the young Tinubu sets the records straight on the signage brouhaha. He also bares his mind on his passion and pains as a son of the political luminary\n\nRecently, there was a report of a crisis between your company, Loatsad and LASAA on one side, and the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN), on the other. Tell us what happened.\n\nIt was nothing really serious, just a little misunderstanding. Everything has been resolved. However, for me personally, there is nothing better than the truth. All that matters to me is to let the truth be the narrative of the story. I don\u2019t have anything to hide because our company, Loatsad is an outfit that operates and follows every regulation of LASAA to the letter. For me, I am particularly against pushing false narratives. So, when I see false narratives being pushed about Loatsad, it really hurts me because this company is beyond Seyi Tinubu. There are over 100 people \u2014from drivers to scores of creative guys\u2014 who work for the group as a whole. But because of an individual, some would then sit somewhere to push a false narrative about a whole company, employing partisan politics to damage the efforts of hundreds of these young individuals? That really hurts.\n\nDo you belong to OAAN?\n\nYes, we are a member, though we are very new.\n\nBut your coming into outdoor advertising has generated a lot of controversies. Questions have been raised about your eligibility as a practitioner. How did you find yourself in the industry?\n\nI didn\u2019t just stumble into the industry. When I finished from Nigeria Law School after I re-sat for my bar exams \u2014I actually failed at my first attempt\u2014 and I was eventually called to the bar, it then dawned on me to figure out what I really wanted to do for myself. What I honestly knew then was that I don\u2019t want to be chasing jobs or work under my father. I had promised myself to earn his respect by creating my own path. My business partner and friend, Adenrele Olusoga, then sat down to look at different opportunities we could explore. We tried many ideas including an online digital movie platform like Netflix which didn\u2019t work out. We really went through various opportunities and looked at those failed experiences after which we discovered we had a passion to create something that would be innovative and unique. By extension, we discovered our flair for advertising, particularly in the digital space. Hence, we decided to float Loatsad Promomedia to operate both in the digital and out-of-home sub-sector of the advertising industry. We applied to the relevant bodies and got the licence to operate. And in the shortest time, we discovered our niche and have made a significant impact.\n\nWhere did the seed money to start Loatsad come from?\n\nWe never started with advertising though. My partner and I had run multiple start-up companies. When we were about to start Loatsad, we had to clear our savings. My wife, Layal, also an entrepreneur, chipped in her resources too. Of course, when you have a dream, you have to be determined and audacious in planning your finances towards the project. We created a timeline alongside our financial plans and that\u2019s what has helped us. We were lucky as our plans scaled through.\n\nThe truth is many still wondered how your very young agency could manage to get those strategic, juicy sites.\n\nOk, let me use the Lekki Tollgate as an example. The owner of that asset is LCC. With regards to the site, would you believe me if I told you that I wasn\u2019t in the country when the company applied and the process for the concession of the site started? Loatsad made an application to LCC and we proposed a new concept of putting an LED on the structure. We also approached Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the regulatory body. While we are still in that process, I left Nigeria for my Masters. My partner continued the whole process. So, if you look through our contract agreements with LCC which I can make available to the public if necessary, we made the best offer to the LCC \u2014N100 million for the concession\u2014 and not that it was just handed over to us like that. But talking about sites and juicy locations, at Loatsad, give us an empty land and we would turn it into a juicy site. You know why? We have a bunch of brilliant guys working to make this happen. We always sit together to put our minds together to create great ideas. That\u2019s what we did also with Falomo Bridge. Before we moved into that location, Falomo was water. We had to sand-fill and dredge that site. We built that site from nothing to how it stands today. You can verify all my claims from those who should know.\n\nYou mean your father\u2019s name didn\u2019t help in acquiring most of these sites?\n\nNo, never. I have never entered any room to demand any site. I have never used my father\u2019s name to influence any site given to me. I do not believe in such practice. I believe that whatever I do, I must be able to be above aboard. I am open to scrutiny and willing to be assessed fairly. Come to think of it, if I have done that, I am very sure multiple people would have come out to counter me. The truth is we grew as a company which evolved from using just static boards and lamp posts to LEDs. We realised there was a new market for us to enter. Digital is the future, and we are the future \u2014we are the youngest in the game here. People were using the traditional methods of putting up a board, and we entered the space and made a change, giving advertisers something significantly more powerful for their brand. For all those who keep talking about Loatsad and my father, one thing they have failed to realise is that Loatsad, on its own strength, has been able to work with a lot of multinationals and partnered with many international tools like Airpush, Shazam, Rocketfuel and Snapchat for pop-ups ads on your mobile. I don\u2019t know whether Snapchat knows who Tinubu is. But Loatsad has been able to build its reputation in its area of business without any external influence. We were invited by Facebook to their headquarters in Seattle, United States about three or four years ago. I think it\u2019s high time people started to give credit to every staff member of Loatsad who is doing all the creative stuff in the industry. It\u2019s not fair for anyone to think we got to where we are because of, maybe phone calls, from my dad to some people. Did the name open the door? Maybe, but if it opens a door in a bank or others, will it open a door with Coca-Cola or other multinationals that use our services? The truth and reality is that we deliver with a great deal of passion. We are persistent and tenacious and we believe we offer real value. Our aim is to let brands thrive in the best possible way and we see our services as a unique medium to facilitate that process.\n\nBut the name has come with some baggage?\n\nDefinitely! Some people think all these successes by Loatsad in our less than a decade of existence was because I am Seyi Tinubu. Sir, if I were in the banking industry today, some people would still talk: \u2018Oh he\u2019s only on top at the bank because he\u2019s Tinubu\u2019s son. What do they want me to do? To be carrying my father\u2019s suitcase up and down? No! The truth is that I cannot tie myself to my father\u2019s apron. I have to be my own man. I have to create my own family and legacy. That\u2019s how my dad and mom \u2014Senator Oluremi Tinubu\u2014 raised us to be. We were all told from day one: once you are done with school, that\u2019s all we can give you.\n\nThe same thing happened during the Corona pandemic. We were all out there helping with foods and other relief packages to support the less privileged affected by the global shutdown. We understand that the majority of Nigerians are living from hand to mouth and we have to help in whatever capacity we can. But while we were doing all that, then we started hearing those funny narratives of \u2018Yes, we said it; they are already grooming the boy as the next governor.\u2019 Which governor? Haba! This is just a pure CSR being carried out by our company. It has become part of my nature not to sit back and watch while some people suffer. I must surely help as much as I can.\n\nYour company also acquired a big outdoor firm, e-Motion for an undisclosed amount. How did you manage to achieve such a huge feat?\n\nLet me tell you a story. When I finished my Masters a couple of years back, my dad called me to his place in Abuja. He asked me what I wanted to do next or where I wanted to work. I said to him that I didn\u2019t want his money but that all I want is his moral support. This is because if I take his money and don\u2019t grow it, he will obviously not be happy with me. In all honesty, when we were about to make a bid for e-Motion, I consulted him. And the only reason for that was to inform him \u2014as a father\u2014 about my worries on how we are going to finance the acquisition. I told him I need a financial backup \u2014that was after I had opened up to him about our company\u2019s finances. All he did was to give me a strong financial advice and plans. And that advice actually worked perfectly for us. The truth is since we acquired E-Motion, till today, we have not finished repayment of the facility.\n\nWasn\u2019t it a 100 per cent acquisition?\n\nYes, it is 100 per cent acquisition. But in our agreement, it wasn\u2019t a one-off payment but staggered.\n\nBut couldn\u2019t your father help out here?\n\nThe truth is my father wasn\u2019t aware when the acquisition was completed. Of course, he knew I wanted to buy a company but he didn\u2019t know it was E-Motion. He didn\u2019t even know when we opened the discussion on the acquisition. Aside consulting him on financing, I also engaged him deliberately to know his perspective about advertising generally. When one has such a brilliant mind like my father, who is so vast in all disciplines, including advertising, banking, law and even real estate, and you can access him, I know he will give a sound advice. That\u2019s all I need from him. But thanks to my partner, our lawyers and the bank, they have helped us to achieve the acquisition without getting into any financial trouble.\n\nWas the investment really worth the effort?\n\nWell, it has been a headache; I must confess. The acquisition was concluded late 2019, and as we were tidying up the deal in the New Year, by March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic hit us. This was followed by the total lockdown and shutdown of businesses. While we were hoping things were coming back to normal, then the Lekki First Roundabout and second roundabout were removed for the junction improvements by the state government. These are some of E-Motion prime sites. So, what exactly did we acquire then? Of course, their sites from Falomo to Kilometre 13 were an addition. But to tell you the truth, what we acquired was a brand new company. For me, I believe then that E-Motion was sitting on a goldmine but they are not actually utilising it enough and we had to step in.\n\nDespite the influence of your father as a prominent figure in this country, do you have any pain at all?\n\nYes I do. As a human being, you have your ups-and-downs. But what pained me the most was when some people attribute our success to my name or my pedigree. It is painful to see the lack of recognition given to these guys who work day and night to make Loatsad the brand it has become. It pains me each time some wrong narratives are pushed to water down all our efforts. Anyways, one of those lessons I was raised with was to always stay true to myself and to never let what anybody else says distract me from my goals. Criticism is needed but baseless accusations and pushing of false narratives help nobody and change nothing. They only serve to further divide us when we should be coming together.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your passion for polo. How did the interest start and do you truly own a stable somewhere in Ikoyi, Lagos as alleged by some people?\n\nI listened to the old man who made those wild claims and found it so unfortunate. The truth is, I do not have a horse stable in Lagos or anywhere in the world. But as we speak now, I am already working on owning my stable. I am building my own stable outside Falomo. In fact, it will be far from the Lagos metro but somewhere close to Epe. I already own some horses and ponies enough to start a team. That\u2019s why I am building my own stable. On my passion for polo, I would say I honestly love polo. I started riding horses at age 8 but started playing polo at age 13. Now, my second home is on a horse because when you\u2019re on a great horse, you have the best seat you will ever have. Horses sometimes give you the wings one lack and while riding a horse, you can borrow some freedom. With that sport, once you are on the field, your brain is free and open. You push aside all the worries about business and every other thing. You are so free and that\u2019s why I\u2019m completely hooked on polo.",

          "title": "Southern Govs: How we\u2019ll enforce open grazing ban",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan; Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti; Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri; TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt; Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki and Obinna Odogwu, Awka\n\nDespite criticisms and opposition, mainly from the North, that have continued to trail the resolutions by the Southern Governors Forum, to implement the ban on open grazing in the 17 states that make up the geopolitical zone, governors of the affected states insist they are ready to go on with their plans once the bill is passed by lawmakers in the states\u2019 Houses of Assemblies and later signed into law.\n\nAsked how enforceable is the bill if eventually signed into law, given the fact that the states are still going to rely on the men and officers of the Nigerian Police Force, a federal government organ, to implement the ban, Ekiti State Commissioner of Information, Hon. Akin Omole, dismissed the envisaged problem with a wave of hand.\n\n\u201cThe first thing to look at is to see the power that a particular governor has under the law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the state government has power under the constitution of Nigeria to carry out something, a policy, the question of whether it is the federal government that has the police does not arise. It is the constitutionality of that decision that is important, if it is within the powers of the state shows the governor can act without any fear of any sort.\n\n\u201cThe second thing is that if a governor is part of a decision taken with others, I do not see any situation where he can come back and say he was not part of that decision. It was a well-thought out decision and he has not come out to say he is dissenting, so, we don\u2019t have any difficulty in that so far we are able to come home and see the constitutionality of our actions. If it is constitutional, you can be sure that our governor will implement it.\u201d\n\nReacting to the criticisms and opposition the resolution has generated so far, from Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders of Nigeria (MACBAN), Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and some Northern Nigerian governors, Omole saw that as a storm in a teacup.\n\n\u201cWe are a state government,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody is opposing something, we are not under anybody. If somebody is opposing a particular thing, it is the law that put the governor there and he will operate within the law. If so far that we are guided by law, we don\u2019t mind who is opposing one thing or the other. It is the law that will determine our decision not minding whether an individual is against it or not. Nobody is bigger than the law of the country. It is the law that is our guide and we will continue to act in accordance with the law of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu echoed similar sentiments on the issue. He said the state government is already working on a law to give legal backing to the ban on open grazing of cattle in southern Nigeria as announced by governors of the 17 states of the Southern region. He told Saturday Sun that very soon, the law which is expected to spell out sanctions against violators of the ban, will soon be rolled out for the police to enforce. Like Omole argued, he added that it was the duty of the police to enforce laws made by constituted authorities at the federal, states or local government level.\n\n\u201cThe police do not have a choice,\u201d he explained. \u201cOnce a law is made by a constituted authority, in this case, the state assembly and signed into law, the police cannot say it\u2019s a state law. Let me tell you that majority of the laws enforced by police are state laws. Majority of the offences in this country are offences at the level of the state.\u201d According to him, the other 16 states of the South will need to domesticate the law prohibiting open grazing for the purpose of seamless enforcement in the region.\n\nIn Imo, the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba informed that the bill to enforce the ban on open grazing is already underway in the state\u2019s House of Assembly. He assured that once the bill is passed into law the state government would not waste time in implementing it.\n\nRivers State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said the Southern governors would work out modalities for the implementation of the law banning open grazing.\n\nHe added that the fact the governors met recently and agreed to ban open grazing in their region, shows that it is their (Southern governors) responsibility to determine how to go about it. He said: \u201cSouthern governors met and took a decision. They will work out modalities for its implementation. It\u2019s not for states to say how they will implement the law.\u201d\n\nBut while majority of the states are waiting to pass a bill on it, states like Bayelsa and Ebonyi had already done so. In a chat with Saturday Sun, the Balyesa State Government said that its anti-opening law which was signed into by Govenor Douye Diri was already in full operation before the 17 Southern Governors resolution took place.\n\nDiri had assented to the Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation Law 2021 which banned opened grazing in the state, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr David Alagoa noted. The man who heads the 23-member committee constituted to implement the ban in consonance with representatives of security agencies assured that the state will not have any problem implementing the resolution of the Southern governors with the anti-opening grazing law.\n\nAccording to him before the bill was passed into law, there was a public hearing on the matter attended by the representatives of Miyetti Allah. He said after the governor assented to the bill after it was passed into law. That was after the state government had met with representatives to explain to them the nature of the implementation and consequences of default.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe meet with the Miyetti Allah and explained to them that we have banned open-grazing in the state. We gave them the option of moving their cattle to Bayelsa Palm, where we have over 1000 hectares of land for grazing or leave the state. Some of them that were comfortable with the Bayelsa Palm moved their cattle there and others left. So now in Bayelsa State, there are no cattle roaming about because we have banned opening grazing. We have a lot of farmers who have borrowed money for their farms so we cannot afford to have cattle to destroy those farms. There is no problem with the implementation in Bayelsa.\u201d\n\nEbonyi is another of the Southern states in the country that has enacted a law against open grazing. The state Governor, David Umahi, recently wondered why the Fulani herdsmen were still grazing their cows openly in clear defiance to the law. He thereafter ordered local government chairmen in the state to work with the local vigilante and the Ebubeagu security operatives in the state to enforce the law.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abakaliki recently after the weekly state security council meeting, he said though herdsmen had left the state after their attack on Egedegede Community in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state for fear of reprisal, there is urgent need for effective enforcement of the law in all parts of the state. He said: \u201cThe information we have is that no herdsman is in Ebonyi, as at today. That is to further prove that they were privy to the attack on Egedegede Community. We are not asking them to leave but they should remain wherever they are for now until tension subsides.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting the good ones to return when normalcy returns, but the bad ones should not return to soil of Ebonyi because we will not take it any longer. Only the ones who are ready to respect our law against open grazing and those ready to live in peace with our people should return.\u201d\n\nSpecial Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Security Matters, Mr. Fatai Owoseni, a former Commissioner of Police in Lagos and Benue States, also noted that before all the governors in the Southern part of Nigeria, agreed to ban open grazing in the region, the state already Anti-Open Grazing Law.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday Sun in Ibadan, he explained that the Oyo State House of Assembly held a public hearing, during which inputs were taken from different stakeholders, including the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN).\n\nHe stated further that apart from the Anti-Open Grazing Law, provisions have also been made for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) for settlement of cases. He warned that those in the forest that have been parading themselves as herdsmen to deceive members of the public would be treated as criminals. He noted that the law is very clear on who can prosecute and would be followed strictly. He added that all law enforcements agencies must obey the law, saying Amotekun Corps is also a creation of the law.\n\nBut in its reaction, the Anambra State government said that there was no plan to enact a law for the enforcement of the ban on open grazing noting that the governor, Chief Willie Obiano, had given the security agencies the directive to enforce the ban.\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment in the state, Don Adinuba, made this stance known when he told Saturday Sun that the state government would not go beyond making use of the security agents to enforce the ban.\n\n\u201cWe will make use of the security agents. That\u2019s all. The law is not necessary. The governor can issue a directive. Secondly, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum had in February or so banned open grazing. So, whether it is in Anambra or Imo or Lagos, it is the same situation. Enacting a law against open grazing is not necessary. And the state is not planning to come up with a law. We don\u2019t need it.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Interactions severed 8 days ago after demanding fresh N170m ransom\n\n\u2022N60m earlier paid by parents ignored\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nParents of the remaining 16 abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna State, have been thrown into further confusion, following the decision of the kidnappers to cut further communications with them.\n\nBandits invaded the school on April 18 and abducted 22 students and a staff. They initially demanded N800 million for the release of the students. However, to push their demand for ransom, they killed five of the students on two occasions, when negotiations were still ongoing.\n\nSources said the last time the kidnappers called any of the parents was on April 8, eight days ago, during which they made fresh demand of N10 million ransom on each of the 16 students and a staff of the university still being held, which comes to N170 million.\n\nPrior to this, the parents had collectively paid N60 million ransom without getting a result.\n\nThe decision of the kidnappers to cut communications for days has been causing great anxiety among the parents, with some of them afraid for the lives of their children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is happening again. We don\u2019t know what is happening to our children. They (kidnappers) are not talking to us again. You know they have been threatening to kill them if we don\u2019t pay more and suddenly we are not hearing anything again. We are so scared and praying that God will touch their hearts not to harm our children. We are anxiously waiting for them (bandits) to call and say something, so that we will know that our children are alive,\u201d remarked one of the parents yesterday.\n\nThe distraught parents are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to help secure the release of the students before \u201csomething sinister happens to them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna yesterday during a special prayer session for the release of the students, spokesman of the parents, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, urged Buhari to use his good offices to secure the release of their children.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnappers have demanded N10 million from each of the parents of the students, making a total of N160 million for 16 students.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about their safety. The innocent students had spent 24 days in the kidnappers\u2019 den. Even after, we the parents have collectively paid them over N60 million ransom for the release of our children, they failed to release them.\n\n\u201cWe, the parents are appealing to the federal government to assist us to pay the ransom demanded or find any other way to ensure the safe return of our children,\u201d Zarmai pleaded.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, the leader of the bandits who abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, on May 3, threatened to kill them if a ransom of N100 million, in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles, were not provided the following day.\n\nJalingo confirmed that the families of the abducted students had already paid N55 million, adding that money had been spent on feeding the students.\n\nOne of the students was released after his parents paid N20 million ransom to the bandits.\n\nThe Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-rufai has not helped matters by openly declaring that he would not pay ransom to kidnappers. However, he has not been able to motivate the rescue of any of the abductees since his declaration.\n\nSecurity agencies have also been lethargic in their approach to freeing the Greenfield 17. Most Nigerians still cannot comprehend why they cannot track the location of the abductees and rescue them, despite previous numerous communications between the parents and the kidnappers.\n\nThe federal government and the Kaduna State Government and security agencies have come under intense criticism for their failure to secure the adducted Greenfield University students after 28 days in the dungeon of their abductors.\n\nAfter the kidnappers killed the first three students, the leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, remarked that it was regrettable that security situation could break down so bad in a regime led by a retired army general.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt shows the extent to which security has broken down under General Muhammadu Buhari. It shows his incompetence and how far he is inefficient as a former commander. Each time we talk about him, Lai Mohammed will put up a propaganda saying everything is in order and Buhari is the best President that we have ever had. It is until they kill all of us that they will now know he should have left the place. Law and order have broken down in the country, there\u2019s no doubt about that. The earlier people persuade Buhari to get out of the place the better for all of us.\u201d\n\nMike Ozekhome, (SAN) said he wasn\u2019t disappointed at the floppy manner in which the federal government has been handling the issue of kidnappings in Nigeria, especially in the recent time.\n\nThe fiery lawyer said Nigerians ought not to be surprised at the turn of things in the country, given the failure of the government to resolve previous kidnappings. He asked, \u201cWhat were Nigerians expecting? Where is Leah Sharibu? Where are the Chibok girls abducted since April 2014? Has this government ever walked the talk in its vain glorious posturing against Boko Haram, armed banditry, herdsmen, kidnapping and other violent crimes across the board in Nigeria? Has Nigeria not been turned into a sprawling field of crimson and pouring the blood of innocent Nigerians?\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says preparations for upcoming electoral activities may be affected\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is worried by the serial fire attacks on its offices in some states, especially in the South-east zone, which have resulted in the destruction of buildings and vital election equipment.\n\nThe latest destruction took place in Enugu State on Thursday night, where INEC\u2019s office in Udenu Local Government Area was set ablaze by hoodlums.\n\nFollowing the series of attacks, the Commission resolved to convene an emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) next week to discuss this disturbing trend.\n\nThe Commission is also convening an emergency meeting with all the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) on Wednesday 19th May 2021 in Abuja ahead of the meeting of the ICCES.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Publicity and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, remarked yesterday: \u201cThe latest destruction of the Commission\u2019s physical infrastructure and electoral facilities in Enugu State calls for an immediate review of the measures necessary to secure INEC\u2019s assets across the states.\u201d\n\nOkoye, in a statement adds: \u201cThe spate of fire incidents involving the facilities of INEC in some states of the Federation had unfortunately persisted. This time around, it is Enugu State, where the Resident Electoral Commissioner for the state, Emeka Ononamadu, has reported that the INEC office in Udenu Local Government Area was set ablaze.\n\n\u201cThe latest tragic incident occurred around 8.40pm on Thursday 13th May 2021. No casualties were reported. However, the office building was extensively damaged while electoral materials and office equipment were destroyed in spite of the best efforts of the Enugu State Fire Service to contain the inferno. The Commission appreciates the intervention of the Fire Service. The attention of the Police has been drawn to this yet another very worrisome development for investigation.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the attack in Udenu Local Government was the third incident involving INEC\u2019s local government offices in three states, in less than two weeks.\n\n\u201cFirst, there was the destruction of the office in Essien Udim LGA of Akwa Ibom State on 2nd May 2021. This was followed by the fire at the Ohafia LGA office in Abia State on 9th May 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another setback to the Commission\u2019s ongoing activities and preparations for upcoming electoral activities,\u201d said Okoye.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission, Okoye said, is determined to continue to discharge its responsibly, including the conclusion of the expansion of voters\u2019 access to polling units, resumption of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), capacity-building activities, the review of the draft Strategic Plan 2022-2026, engagement with stakeholders, as well as all scheduled and pending elections.\n\nAt least, 19 offices of the Commission have been gutted by fire in the last two years, findings have revealed.\n\nA breakdown of the fire incidents showed that the most affected states include Akwa Ibom (4); Abia (3); Anambra (2) and Imo (2).\n\nOther states that witnessed fire incidents between February 2019 and May 2021 are Borno, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Kano, Ondo, Plateau and Rivers. Abuja was also affected.\n\nIt was learnt that while 11 offices were burnt by hoodlums, eight others were gutted by fire under mysterious circumstances or by electrical fault.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has started mobilising its affiliate unions and civil society organisations to join the strike in Kaduna State, scheduled to commence midnight Sunday, May 16.\n\nNLC had threatened to mobilise workers in both public and private sectors to shut down economic activities in the state over what it described as obnoxious anti-worker policies: arbitrary and illegal declaration of redundancies; premature compulsory retirement of all officers on grade levels 14 and above, by the state government.\n\nIn a circular issued by its acting General Secretary, Ishmail Bello, NLC instructed the leadership of all its affiliate unions to ensure that the strike commences from midnight, Sunday, May 16.\n\n\u201cWe write to communicate to all affiliate unions of the NLC to fully mobilise all their members in Kaduna to a complete and indefinite withdrawal of services until a counter directive is issued by the leadership.\u201d\n\nThe circular also urged allies and affiliate unions in neighbouring states to mobilise to Kaduna to support the strike.\n\nAlready, one of the allies, the Centre for Labour Studies (CLS) has offered to give total support for the planned shutdown of economic activities in Kaduna State\n\nA statement signed by its Director, Femi Aborisade said that other unions, including the Trade Union Congress (TUC), should unite and join forces with the NLC to defeat the unitary ideology in industrial relations being spearheaded by the Kaduna State government.\n\n\u201cWe call on all trade unions and pro-labour civil society and human rights organisations to join forces with the NLC in its just strike in Kaduna State against the following obnoxious anti-worker policies: arbitrary and illegal declaration of redundancies; premature compulsory retirement of all officers on grade levels 14 and above, officers who are 50 years and above, and officers who have been in service for 30 years or more; conversion of permanent employees on grade levels 1-6 to casual workers status and stoppage of pension for pensioners who have earned pension for 5 to 10 years but have refused to die,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe centre said that the right to pension \u201cis a constitutionally guaranteed right,\u201d which is also guaranteed in the civil and public service rules in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, Rule 02809 of the Kaduna State Government Public Service Rules (2005) and Part II, Regulation 10(3)(c) at page 34 of the Unified Local Government Service Staff Regulations (2012), provide that the compulsory retirement age for all grades in the service shall be 60 years or 35 years of pensionable service, whichever is earlier,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Centre further said that the phenomenon of physical insecurity involving bloodshed, killings, abductions, kidnappings, insurgency, and terrorism in Kaduna State is related to economic insecurity.\n\nAccording to CLS, Kaduna State has become one of the most dangerous states to visit, work or live. \u201cThis is because of massive layoffs which the state government started in 2016/2017 when about 22,000 teachers, 8,000 workers in MDAs (Ministries, Departments, and Agencies), 800 workers in the state\u2019s Internal Revenue Service Dept, and over 4,000 local government workers were laid off.\n\nCLS adds: \u201cThis year, according to the NLC, the state government has disengaged 6,000 workers, including local government and primary health care workers. Eleven thousand (11,000) workers have been short-listed for disengagement on account of being in service for 30 years and above and/or being on level 14 and above.\u201d\n\nCLS urged other unions, including the TUC, to unite and join forces with the NLC to defeat the unitary ideology in industrial relations and the vicious war on workers\u2019 rights being waged by the Kaduna State government, \u201cotherwise, other state governments would emulate the draconian and wicked labour policies and practices in Kaduna State, and workers\u2019 rights in other states nationally would come under severe threat.\u201d\n\nOfficials of the Kaduna State Government were not available for reactions to the strike starting next Monday, but the government has persistently defended the ongoing rationalization in the civil service, citing bloated wage bill, redundant staff and dwindling revenue.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai said a significant amount of the statutory federal allocations to the state \u201cis being spent on the wages of public servants.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision to shed weight in the civil service was one of the necessary moves to salvage the state\u2019s finances.\n\nEl-rufai adds: \u201cTherefore, the state government has no choice but to shed some weight and reduce the size of the public service. It is a painful but necessary step to take, for the sake of the majority of the people of this state. The public service of the state with less than 100,000 employees and their families cannot be consuming more than 90% of government resources, with little left to positively impact the lives of the more than 9 million that are not political appointees or civil servants. It is gross injustice for such a micro minority to consume the majority of the resources of the state.\u201d\n\nHe promised to work with the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAS) to expedite payments of the contributory pension benefits to cushion the effect of the disengagement.\n\nEl-Rufai also vowed to give \u201cpreferential treatment to those disengaged that are willing to take advantage of the state government\u2019s various agricultural and entrepreneurship development schemes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Kingsley Nweze in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has stated that the fugitive, Gimba Yau Kumo, declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practics Commission (ICPC) over an alleged $65 million fraud is no longer his son-in-law.\n\nThe ICPC yesterday began a manhunt for Kumo over alleged fraud, committed with two others, while he was the Managing Director, Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN).\n\nA statement issued yesterday by the President\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the latest move by the ICPC to declare Kumo wanted, notwithstanding his connections, has shown the seriousness of the Buhari administration to fight corrupt practices in the country.\n\nThe release stated, inter alia: \u201cA running story to the effect that the ICPC has declared \u2018an in-law of the President\u2019 wanted in connection with fraud involving the large sum of money, USD65 million to be exact. This should normally be an affirmation that our anti-corruption agencies/institutions are truly independent and allowed unfettered freedom by the President; which is in fact the case. That a state institution can issue such is a measure of the administration\u2019s commitment to accountability, equality and justice.\n\n\u201cTo set the records straight, the person declared wanted by the ICPC is not an in-law to President Buhari. While at some point in time, the said fugitive from justice had been linked to a family member in marriage; that relationship has ended some years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unfortunate to bring the Presidents family into this case. It is in our view an attempt to generate views and sell copies of sensational reporting.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s position at all times is that the law be allowed to take its course. As is well known of him, President Muhammadu Buhari will not provide any cover for crime, no matter who is involved.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC yesterday began a manhunt for Kumo over the alleged fraud.\n\nKumo, a former Managing Director, FMBN, got married to Buhari\u2019s daughter in October 2016 in Daura, Katsina State.\n\nAccording to the commission, Kumo is wanted alongside Tarry Rufus and Bola Ogunsola over alleged misappropriation and dispersion of national housing fund.\n\nThe notice, published on the commission\u2019s website was signed by the ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Azuka Ogugua.\n\nIt reads, \u201cThe persons whose pictures appear above, Mr Tarry Rufus, Mr Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of $65m.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters, Abuja, any of the ICPC state offices or the nearest police station.\u201d\n\nKumo\u2019s tenure at FMBN was characterised by allegations of corruption.\n\nIt was alleged that the fleeing former boss of FMBN and three others paid themselves outrageous severance packages at the end of their tenure in October 2014.\n\nLast month, the senate committee on public accounts summoned Kumo to explain the alleged irregular award of N3 billion contract when he was still at the bank.\n\nIn a related development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said that the latest revelation of $65 million fraud in the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), in which President Buhari\u2019s former son in-law, Kumo, is allegedly involved, \u201cfurther confirms that the Buhari Presidency is indeed a sanctuary for fraudsters, treasury looters and common criminals.\u201d\n\nThe party charged the ICPC not to succumb to reported pressure from the cabal in the Buhari Presidency but to track down Kumo, and bring him to book alongside his accomplices.\n\nThe PDP in a statement yesterday by National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said it speaks volumes that the Buhari Presidency had remained silent in the face of this huge fraud.\n\nThe PDP said it holds it as wicked, afflicting and provocative \u201cthat while millions of hardworking Nigerians cannot afford their daily meals and other basic necessities of life due to the misrule and corruption of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its administration, they are daily assailed by revelations of unbridled treasury looting under President Buhari\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\nThe PDP adds, \u201cIs it not provocative that at the time the Buhari administration is moving to cut workers\u2019 salaries; increase the cost of fuel, electricity and other tariffs; in a country with over 33 per cent unemployment and where citizens have been subjected to the worst forms of poverty; government officials, cronies and relations of those in power are busy looting our agencies and carting away our common patrimony?\n\n\u201cIt is even more distressing that the looted FMBN money is part of funds contributed by Nigerians to meet their home needs which has instead fallen under the predatory proclivities of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cWhile the Buhari Presidency parades a holier than thou attitude, the nation\u2019s vaults have been laid open for the ruthless pillaging by family members, relations, cronies in the Buhari Presidency.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the Buhari Presidency to allow for an open investigation of Mr. President\u2019s son-in-law.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Airtel Africa, the holding company for Bharti Airtel\u2019s operations in Africa, has released its financial report for the year ended March 31, 2021. One of the report highlights is that the company\u2019s revenues are up by 14.2% to $3.8 billion.\n\nOn the back of this revenue, Airtel Africa also posted net profits of $415 million, a slight growth of 1.8% from the previous year where it made $408 million in profits after tax.\n\nDespite the flat profit growth, it is still an impressive result for the business in a year where Covid-19 has stalled economic growth across Africa. Additionally, in Nigeria, the company\u2019s biggest market, a ban on SIM card registration stifled growth.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s CEO, Raghunath Mandava, said in a statement, \u201cIn these challenging times, I want to say a huge thank you to all our employees, our business partners, and governments and regulators who have supported us, and in turn facilitated our continued support to the economies and communities we serve.\n\nOur performance has been strong, \u201cwith reported growth of 13.6% in underlying revenue and 18.3% in underlying EBITDA, and constant currency growth of 19.4% and 25.2%, respectively. Contributions to this growth came across all regions, with particular improvement in Francophone Africa, and across all our major services, with mobile money, data and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nA look at the company\u2019s significant services shows that voice revenue continues to lead the way, bringing in more than half its revenue. Yet, that does not tell the whole story, as the growth in voice revenue has slowed over the last few years.\n\nData and mobile money revenue are the real stars of the show. Data contributed 35% to the revenue as it continues to show promise as Airtel deepens its investment in internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cData usage per customer reached 2.6 GB per customer (from 1.8 GB per customer) led by an increase in smartphone penetration and expansion of our home broadband and enterprise customers. This helped us grow data revenue 31.2% in constant currency. Growing penetration and usage of 3G and 4G data customers helped us grow data ARPU 8.2%. 4G data usage more than doubled in the year, contributing 62.2% of total data usage on the network in Q4\u201921.\u201d\n\nAirtel Money is also seeing significant growth, adding $401 million to revenue compared to the $311 million it added last year. According to Airtel, \u201cWe have increased the number of mobile money agents by 30.7%, kiosks by 68.8% and mobile money branches by 95%. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, both through partnerships with leading financial institutions and through expansion of our merchant ecosystem, have further strengthened our mobile money propositions.\u201d\n\nAnother important update from the report is a leadership change at Airtel Africa as Mandava will retire from his post and as a director on 30 September. Olusegun Ogunsanya will take over as the new managing director and CEO.",

          "title": "A startup bill for Nigeria is being discussed between founders, investors and government reps",
          "text": "One landmark acquisition, several funding rounds and meaningful expansions have drawn attention to Nigeria\u2019s potential to become an enabling environment for businesses. Nigerian tech startups are raising larger seed rounds and pursuing unique global ambitions than at any other time in the last decade.\n\nBut in the last 18 months, major regulatory events that ended motorcycle-hailing and suspended cryptocurrency transactions through banks have been interpreted as setbacks to innovation.\n\nOne problem with these types of regulations is how sudden they are, seemingly without forewarning from the hammer bearers. They raise an unambiguous question: can startups really flourish in Nigeria?\n\nTo dispel such fears and sustain optimism about doing business in Nigeria, startup leaders are fishing for solutions with the cooperation of government officials. One urgent offer on the table is a Nigeria startup bill.\n\nMaking laws work\n\nLast weekend, Kola Aina*, founding partner of Ventures Platform, talked about a plan to \u201cco-create an executive bill that will support the growth of our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe event was a virtual ecosystem townhall with the theme Making laws work for startups in Nigeria.\n\nAina was joined by Adaeze Sokan, Ventures Platform\u2019s director of strategy and policy; Iyin Aboyeji*, general partner of Future Africa; and Adia Sowho, acting CEO of Thrive Agric.\n\nAlso on the call were Oswald Guobadia, senior special assistant to the Nigerian president on digital transformation; Ife Adebayo, special assistant to the vice president on innovation and entrepreneurship; and Jon Stever, managing director of Innovation for Policy Foundation (i4Policy), a consultancy.\n\n\u201cMany of us have tried to do business with certain countries and institutions, and many of them often cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason they can\u2019t interact with us,\u201d Sowho said, explaining the need for a startup act.\n\nApart from disruptive regulation, she listed weak infrastructure and difficulty accessing capital among the problems facing Nigerian startups.\n\nA startup act could be a first step in setting up a structure around these problems. Tunisia (in 2018) and Senegal (in 2019) passed startup laws under similar rationales. Startup acts are becoming recognised as a tool for policy innovation in Africa.\n\nGlobal standard, local context\n\nSo what should a Nigerian startup act look like? Firstly, it must reflect the country\u2019s present reality.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is overborrow from the context of other countries,\u201d Sowho said.\n\n\u201cWe need the minutiae of this bill to be from our experience and understanding of this country of ours that is just very difficult to compare to other places.\u201d\n\nThat said, Nigerian startups operate within a global business environment. For one, the majority of venture capital investment in the sector comes from foreign inflows. This binds startups to international standards on operations, ethics and ambition.\n\nAt the very least, Nigerian startups should have enabling business conditions similar to those being designed in Senegal and Tunisia, but also in Ghana (which passed Africa\u2019s first small business act in 1981), South Africa, Kenya\u2026 and with some effort, the United States.\n\nJon Iver of i4Policy making a presentation about small business and startup Acts in Africa\n\ni4Policy helped co-create Senegal\u2019s startup act two years ago. At the townhall, Stever showed a timeline of small business and startup acts in Africa; Nigeria was not present.\n\nHe observed that startup acts are not made through regular lawmaking processes but typically result from entrepreneurs taking the initiative themselves.\n\nBut something else is noteworthy: \u201cIn the cases where this has been really successful, there has always been a government champion that wants to listen to startups,\u201d Stever said.\n\nIt would then seem a good omen for Nigeria\u2019s startup bill plans that this townhall had two government advisors, who work at the intersection of digitization and entrepreneurship, in attendance.\n\nGuobadia called attention to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s new year address, about a need for \u201can enabling environment to turn [young people\u2019s] passions into ideas that can be supported, groomed and scaled.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s agencies have made some moves in this regard.\n\nIn 2018, the Office of ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIIE) was involved in tech policy hackathons in Lagos and Abuja to develop frameworks for entrepreneurship and innovation. One goal of the Ministry of Digital Economy\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2030 strategy document is \u201c[supporting] digital entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions for local and global challenges.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment announced that a draft National Policy on Startups was on the government\u2019s agenda. Otunba Niyi Adebayo, the minister, has made a point of attending startup-related events, whether about attracting investment or engaging startups on what they are building.\n\nCurrently in a virtual meeting with The Bulb Africa Partnership who are presenting a mobile money and peer-to-peer payment/market place and showing interest in setting up a tech hub/campus to support tech startups and train youth who are interested in pic.twitter.com/yqaxf9ReGY \u2014 Otunba Niyi Adebayo (@NiyiAdebayo_) January 7, 2021\n\nIs this another false start?\n\nIt is great to have ecosystem players take the startup bill bull by the horns. But there were reminders \u2013 from Mark Essien, Hotels.ng CEO, and Lexi Novitske, a venture capitalist \u2013 that we have sort of been here before.\n\nGuobadia agreed, but said the presidency has spent time assessing what it would take to do better this time. They have identified a process problem, which will be solved by a \u201cbig tent\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cWe are building a fabric to knit all [relevant] agencies into this initiative. We took the effort to avoid having competing conversations,\u201d Guobadia said.\n\nAina\u2019s presentation indicated that the Nigerian presidency intends to introduce a draft legislation as early as August. It will be based on a draft startup law by ecosystem leaders with input from federal and state stakeholders from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nThe plan for a Nigeria startup bill\n\nTimelines could shift but parties involved in this bill have been in conversations for about two months, Aina said.\n\n\u201cI am very aware that there is already an ongoing consultation with the Lagos state government,\u201d he said, mentioning that a presidential advisory group on the proposed bill has been having meetings.\n\nKola Aina is one of the members of the Nigeria startup ecosystem leading the startup bill efforts\n\nAboyeji said the plans are still evolving at the moment but he is optimistic that this time could be different.\n\n\u201cI think versus other times, we have grown to such a size and scale that is easy to see what the potential benefits of fixing this issue could be.\u201d\n\nHe and Sowho emphasised that a Nigerian startup bill that works will not be achieved without startups participating in the process. \u201cThis will require sweat from all of us and we should be ready to put the work in,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nThe group has set the ball rolling and welcomes interested people to volunteer for the effort by sending an email to partners@venturesplatform.com, or provide feedback through this form.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: TechCabal hosted this event and has a representative on the Advisory Board for the startup bill project. *Through their firms, Kola Aina and Iyin Aboyeji are investors in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",
          "summary": "In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem.\nNupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa.\nThe Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering).\nThe startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation.",

          "text": "Source: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nIn April, TECNO launched the Spark 7 series, a new addition to the brand\u2019s Spark line-up, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIn TECNO\u2019s usual way, the Spark 7 comes with a lot of impressive upgrades when compared to its predecessors under the flagship. For the purpose of this article, we will be focusing on the more popular of the series, the Spark 7P.\n\nOut of the box, the Spark 7P comes in four colour variations \u2013 the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations \u2013 which allows for vivaciously interesting choices to pick from when in the market to buy the Spark 7P device.\n\nSCREEN FOR MAXIMUM VIEW\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nThe Spark 7P\u2019s screen is impressively massive and elegant. The device comes with a bigger and better 6.8-inch edge-to-edge display and a screen resolution of 720*1600 HD, bringing to your fingertips an immersive cinematic experience. Without a doubt, movie lovers, gamers and even vloggers will enjoy unfettered fun in whatever form they choose.\n\nTOP-NOTCH PICTURE QUALITY\n\nSpark 7P\u2019s 8MP selfie camera appears in a notch at the top of the device, with 2 LED flash positioned on both sides of the camera. At the back is the 16MP dual camera, with a depth sensor second module that makes the device\u2019s Video Bokeh feature possible. The camera can record 240fps slow-motion videos. Users can also enjoy close-up photography with a 4cm macro photography mode that allows to capture small and minute details. Additionally, the device includes AI HDR technology to increase dynamic range beyond what is captured by the camera\u2019s sensors, allowing users to take photos with a higher dynamic range, fewer noise and clearer details.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nSummarily, with the Spark 7P\u2019s newly upgraded algorithm AI Camera 3.0 and AI scene detection, photos taken by the device will be much more impressive and attractive under any scenario.\n\nPRIVACY FOR A HIGH PERFORMING MACHINE\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nOne special feature that comes with the Spark 7P is the Peak proof which lets you leave a portion of your screen dark so you can keep personal information out of the glare of people when you use your phone in public places.\n\nThe Spark 7P also packs a punch with a powerful 5,000 mAh battery, so that consumers can run powerful applications and multiple tabs without the need to constantly recharge. The high-performance device that runs on HIOS 7.5 allows for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting the mobile device. The operating system is also bundled with utility applications that allow users to free up memory, freeze applications and limit data accessibility to applications. With the device\u2019s dark mode, the phone also gives users more battery time and decreased blue light emission, reducing eye strain.\n\nAnother highlight of the Spark 7P is its 90Hz refreshing speed. With the blazing-fast 90Hz refresh rate, the animation on the device doesn\u2019t have to look like a flip book, but one smooth, snappy, and refreshing experience.\n\nIn terms of storage capacity, the Spark 7P is available in sizeable 4GB ROM+ 64GB RAM and 4GB+128GB versions and is available at a sweet price range of 60,900 Naira and 68,800 Naira respectively.\n\nTECNO\u2019s Spark series targets trendy students, but has quickly risen to become popular among young working professionals and middle-aged folks. If you are expecting my verdict on the Spark 7, considering its sleek look and feel, camera, battery, high performance and price, I will rate it an 8/10.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick.

Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick. And quite honestly, I still don\u2019t know which to go for between the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations.\n\nNeed I say more? Spark 7P checks all my boxes!

          "text": "On Saturday, May 8, 2021, the first dedicated Nigerian blockchain hub, Convexity Blockchain Hub (CBHUB), was inaugurated in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Stakeholders in the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN).\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the hub, Adedeji Owonibi, CBHUB Founder, says the aim is to create a hub ecosystem where people can come and just focus in a space dedicated to blockchain technology, a space to innovate and create solutions within Nigeria using blockchain.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, the hub will offer blockchain solutions that have absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian blockchain technology ecosystem is an arena relatively unknown to a lot of Nigerians. It is often confused with its more well-known subset, cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are popular uses of blockchain, it can also be used for other things, such as the solutions CBHUB would provide.\n\nThese solutions range from its Convexity Humanitarian Aid Distribution Solution (Chats), which is geared towards creating transparency in the aid distribution space to BitCert, one of its projects aimed at reducing certificate counterfeiting in schools.\n\nAs at launch time, CBHUB has partners in Lagos and also supports communities in Northern Nigeria, teaching classes in the local Hausa language.\n\nThis is a far cry from 2018 when Paxful, a leading Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency exchange, reported that it would be launching a blockchain incubator hub. This hub was to be headed by Chimezie Chuta, the Founder of Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG).\n\nHowever, Chuta says that after reviewing the information provided, the company wasn\u2019t convinced of the initiative\u2019s viability as a self-sustaining business. Ultimately, Paxful decided to pull the plug.\n\nFirst cryptocurrency forensics lab in Africa\n\nThe first African crypto forensics lab was also launched at the event on Saturday. The lab boasts world-class facilities and is the result of a partnership with Chainalysis, a global leader in the cryptocurrency forensics sphere.\n\nA Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime Report cites South Africa-based company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), as the biggest crypto investment scam of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, illicit cryptocurrency trading accounted for just 2% of Africa\u2019s $16 billion trading volume from July 2019 to June 2020, with scams accounting for 55% of this low level of illicit activity.\n\nWhile Africa has the lowest numbers for illicit cryptocurrency trading globally, the launch of CBHUB\u2019s crypto forensics lab is yet another plus in the fight against crypto scams like MTI.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, there are ways to attach identities to blockchain users despite the relative anonymity/pseudonymity of the technology.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) can be aggregated from crypto exchanges, laptops, and phones through which people interact with the blockchain technology.\n\nThe hub will provide essential tools for crypto-crime investigators and security agencies constantly faced with numerous challenges while investigating crypto-based crimes and illicit money transaction activities.\n\nAll that the investigators need is to reskill and upskill on how to use these tools, says Chuta.\n\nConvexity, truly the first?\n\nWhile CBHUB is undoubtedly Nigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub, it is not the first blockchain hub to be established in the country. In 2015, Blockchain Tech Hub was founded by Samuel Benedict Ogbonnaya.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn profile, it \u201cwas established with the aim of pioneering Blockchain innovation in Africa by training and producing the best qualified Blockchain developers in Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Tech Hub is no longer in operation; the link to its advertised website returns a \u201cThis site can\u2019t be reached\u201d page. Attempts to reach Ogbonnaya were futile as his LinkedIn and Twitter accounts last recorded activity in 2019.\n\nNigeria and blockchain\n\nIn October 2020, NITDA announced that it had started developing a blueprint and strategy document for the \u201cNational Adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIt followed this announcement with the release of the Draft National Blockchain Adoption Strategy. The document outlines the roadmap and strategies for adopting blockchain technology by the government in its digital transformation agenda.\n\nIt also highlights the strategic objectives and initiatives that the government will actively pursue through designated Ministries, Departments, & Agencies (MDAs) during the stipulated period.\n\nWhile the Federal Government of Nigeria has so far been silent on its steps going forward, the launch of the CBHUB portends a step in the right direction in Nigeria\u2019s blockchain adoption journey, especially regarding education and skilling up.\n\nThis, of course, must be reviewed in the light of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest crypto order which threw Nigerian crypto traders into a panic in February 2021.\n\nCBN ordered banks to close the accounts of persons or entities transacting cryptocurrency or operating a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt this stage, with its seemingly conflicting policies, two questions come to mind: Should Nigerian blockchain enthusiasts be cautiously optimistic? Would the Nigerian government take any more positive steps regarding blockchain soon?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions in the coming days should reveal more on this.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWarri \u2013 After one week of intensive medical examination and treatment at a government hospital in Asaba, Delta State, the 14 years old girl (name withheld) that was raped by seven able bodied alleged cult boys has finally narrated her ordeal in the hands of the dare devil monsters.\n\nShe told members of the Delta State Child\u2019s Rights Implementation Committee and Sexual Offences Unit of the Ministry of Justice how she was beaten and repeatedly raped by one Aboy Nwaise, Sunday, Michael, Abraham, Uche, Jungle Boy and another who were supposed to be her big brothers in the same neighbourhood at Issele-Uku in Aniocha North local government area of Delta State. She spoke to the government officials after the police had obtained her statement at the hospital.\n\nThe victim said Aboy\u2019s mother had earlier threatened to deal with her through the son, but she never envisaged it would be by violent rape.\n\nShe said they are tenants in Nwaise\u2019s family compound at Ogboli village in Issele-Uku and usually they run errands for Aboy\u2019s father and he usually gives them money to appreciate them.\n\nOn this fateful day, Aboy\u2019s father, one Mr. Otu Nwaise had returned home from work after it had rained briefly. He noticed that there was water in their house and none of his children was home to help him clean up. He beckoned on the neighbour\u2019s daughter (victim) to help sweep the water out of the house, which she did.\n\nThen the next day, the man came back from work, called on the girl and handed her N500 for helping him sweep the house the previous day. This was the money the wife saw him giving to the girl that made her to accuse her of sleeping with the husband.\n\nThe girl including her mother and the woman\u2019s husband were surprised because they had always lived as family and the man had always given money to the children when they run errands for him.\n\nThe next thing she approached the girl, slapped her twice and snatched the money from her hand. Even when the girl\u2019s mother was begging her, she didn\u2019t listen, instead she was threatening to further deal with her.\n\nThen a day after, she was returning home from their auntie\u2019s shop where she had gone to pick her younger brother around 7pm, when the said Aboy accosted her and started interrogating her of what transpired the previous day between her and his mother. While she was trying to explain, Aboy told her to take the brother home and come back so they could resolve the issue sitting, instead of standing. So she obliged.\n\nOn returning, Aboy asked that they go to his friend\u2019s house nearby to sort things out, and she followed him, trusting him as a big brother. She said on getting to the house there were two other boys in there, smoking. And she pleaded with Aboy to quickly explain things to him so she could leave because she was allergic to smoke. But he asked her to hold on a little.\n\nThen again, four other boys came into the room and the next thing Aboy did was to lock the door and put the music that was playing on the highest volume. He then asked her to pull her cloth. At this point she started pleading with him to allow her go, but instead he slapped her and hit her head on the wall and forced her naked. That was when all the boys in the room started taking turns in raping her while the music was very loud that nobody could hear her screaming for help.\n\nShe said there was a friend of theirs who they didn\u2019t allow in because he was telling them that what they were doing was wrong. It was this their friend that helped her home after they were done raping her and opened the door for her to go with a theat to kill her if she ever mentioned them.\n\nMeanwhile, the sight was horrible when the mother saw her in her pool of blood. She had raised an alarm that attracted neighbours who assisted her to rush the daughter to the hospital around that time of 12am. From there they were referred to the Central Hospital in Asaba, but they had to report at the Divisional Police Station in Issele-Uku, where the DPO had to deploy a patrol team to accompany them to Asaba as at 3am that day.\n\nThe case had since been transferred from Issele-Uku Police Station to the State Command and the police are on the trail of the alleged rapists, including Aboy\u2019s mother who had ran away too.\n\nInterestingly, Aboy\u2019s father, Mr. Otu Nwaise had been helping to track his son for an arrest. He had since disowned and condemned the actions of his wife and son, stating that they had been a thorn in his flesh. He prayed that his son is caught to face the law for his crime.\n\nMr. Otu even revealed how he had earlier reported his son to the Anti Cult outfit to arrest him and deal with him for being a cultist. He said the boy had severally threatened his life, calling him \u2018a ju man\u2019.\n\nHowever, the Honourable Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Peter Mrakpor SAN has said that the state must get justice for the victim.\n\nHe confirmed the effort of government in ensuring she receives proper medical attention and then going forward, be rehabilitated including relocating her from that environment.\n\nThe AG then advised every parent who faces a case of rape and defilement of their children to report and leave the rest for the government.\n\nIn the same vein, a member of the State Child\u2019s Rights Implementation Committee, Comrade Patrick Ochei who was detailed to follow up with the case, had commended the Attorney General for equally responding to the situation through the Sexual Offences Unit of the Justice Ministry.\n\nHe appreciated the Commussioner for Justice for taking care of all the expenses arising from the girl\u2019s treatment so far, even with a promise to provide fund for further expenses in terms of rehabilitation and others going forward.\n\nOchei said that the victim being a child would definitely get justice, just as the Committee is poised to do everything within its powers and capacities to prosecute the case to logical conclusion.\n\nHe also affirmed that the Committee would come up with programme on how the girl would be rehabilitated against post rape trauma, adding that this is the time to show her all the love she deserves including assigning a professional counsellor to aid her emotional healing.\n\n...",

This should normally be an affirmation that our anti-corruption agencies/institutions are truly independent and allowed unfettered freedom by the President. Which infact is the case.\n\nThat a state institution can issue such is a measure of the administration\u2019s commitment to accountability, equality and justice.\n\nTo set the records straight, the person declared wanted by the ICPC is not an inlaw to President Buhari.\n\nWhile at some point in time the said fugitive from justice had been linked to a family member in marriage, that relationship has ended some years ago. .it is therefore unfortunate to bring the Presidents family into this case. It is in our view an attempt to generate views and sell copies of sensational reporting.\n\nThe President\u2019s position at all times is that the law be allowed to take its course. As is well known of him, President Muhammadu Buhari will not provide any cover for crime, no matter who is involved.\n\nGarba Shehu.",

Our facility is the first and only purpose-built personalisation bureau in Nigeria at present,\u201d Adeokun said.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to patronize local companies by enforcing local content policy. Government should discourage importation of SIM Cards by Telecommunication Companies (Telcos). Even international passports will be cheaper when printed locally.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that EPayplus\u2019 facility is the first and only purpose-built personalization bureau in Nigeria at present, while noting that the pandemic has made a clear case for the need to look inwards for the country\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 pandemic has given credence to the need to look inwards for manufacturing. We have capacity to do 60million cards per annual. By 2023, we should be doing 90percent of our card production capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nAdeokun noted that with almost 16 years of expertise, the company has proven expertise in the following fields \u2013government, commercial, finance and epayments. Its banking solutions include EMV payment card, Contactless and many more.\n\nElectronic Payplus, he said, also offers effective commercial payment solutions, while its government solutions include National Identity cards and more.\n\nThe CEO noted that 95 percent of the company\u2019s revenues come from smart cards production. \u201cBy 2024, our projection is to have 50 percent of our revenue from digital solutions while the remaining 50 percent will be from smart cards\u201d, he noted.\n\nWhile adapting to the dynamic nature of the EMV system, Electronic Payplus provides support to customer banks through their whole project from the idea to meaning and growth, up to the card personalization and supplementary logistics. The company\u2019s vast personalization competences and supplementary services enables it to provide all types of cards such as ID, driving license and official documents for governments, contactless and prepaid for transportation operators and access badges for enterprises.\n\nIts banking solutions include: EMV Payment card supply, contact, contactless and dual interface, project management, bio-data and biometric enrollment plus audit services, innovative card bodies, card mailing and fulfillment, card delivery service, card instance issuance, and card fraud solution.\n\nThe commercial solutions are: transportation cards, health cards, automated fare collection solution for rail, cable car and buses, co-branded Identity cards for organization, personalization services and solutions, innovative card bodies, access cards, and loyalty cards.\n\nCurrently, its government solutions are National Identity card and resident card for state governments. On chip embedding, Electronic Payplus has a state of the art chip embedding machine that can run huge amount of cards in a fraction of the time it would take a normal machine.\n\nFor card design and printing, its card printing service provides durable cards with vivid coulours that help project clients brand the way they want; while its personalization services include indent printing, embossing and fulfilment services",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Despite Dwindling Revenue : States Waste Billions On Unviable Projects",
          "text": "BY OUR CORRESPONDENTS\n\nEven with the acute paucity of funds following economic downturns that have reduced federal, state and local government revenues, some state governments are still embarking on resource-consuming projects that are not feasible, LEADERSHIP Weekend investigations have revealed.\n\nMost of these projects, it was gathered, may not add any value to the states\u2019 economy, and are likely not to do so in the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile many of such projects are completed, albeit still unutilised or grossly underutilised, many others initiated several years ago are still purportedly under construction, or have been simply abandoned halfway and are at the mercy of incumbent governors who may not necessarily bother to complete them since they equally have their own plans for similar unviable projects.\n\nFindings by our correspondents across the 36 states showed that governance in most of these states are characterised by hardship, rising unemployment and crime, mounting debts, and unmet wage/pension obligations.\n\nSome analysts have argued that most of these public office holders only embark on such white elephant projects to impress the public and consequently gain unearned political points, knowing that the vast majority of Nigerians hardly bother to explore the economic viability of government projects and their prospects for appropriate revenue generation.\n\nSuch projects, the costs of which are often disproportionately inflated, represent some of the many pretexts under which public office holders quietly and conveniently steal public funds and get away with it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that when the trend of airport construction by state governors emerged, for instance, it was obvious that none of the state governors in question were guided by exhaustive feasibility studies.\n\nThough many experts and some other Nigerians also criticised the governors\u2019 decisions to embark on such projects, warning that they would simply end up as a huge waste, they were ignored.\n\nIt was gathered that years after some of the projects were purportedly commissioned and when they are supposed to have been fully functioning and generating revenues by handling an increasing number of regular local and, perhaps, international passenger and cargo flights, the airports remain unutilised except for the chartered flights and private jets that land occasionally.\n\n\n\nThe condition of Dutse International Airport in Jigawa State, for instance, is a typical instance of this disappointing scenario.\n\nApart from the staggering billions of naira wasted in its construction, which could have been invested in the provision of economically viable infrastructure to alleviate the unbearable poverty ravaging the ordinary people of the state, the airport\u2019s close proximity (less than 100 kilometers to Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport) makes it particularly unnecessary.\n\nOur correspondent observed that even the airport itself, which is the first airport in Nigeria, has over the last few decades lost its glory, as many international airlines successively cancelled their operations there due to persistent fall in passenger traffic.\n\nNow, with only a handful of international and local airlines still operating there, the Jigawa airport is now looking more like a glorified airstrip than an international airport.\n\nFurther investigations in Abia, Rivers, Niger, Ogun, Jigawa , Yobe, Kogi, Edo, Osun, Benue Ondo, Bauchi Plateau, Bayelsa , Cross River , Imo and Akwa Ibom and a few other states revealed that mega projects abandoned at different levels of execution are either left to rot away, even as some of them now harbour criminals, reptiles and other dangerous animals.\n\nMost of these projects, it was learnt, were initially financed through loans, some of which are still being paid or serviced by the affected states.\n\nThe Monorail Projects in Cross River and Rivers States, which were initiated by former Governors Donald Duke and Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, now minister of Transportation, are a typical example of abandoned projects.\n\nThe Port Harcourt Monorail Project was awarded by the Amaechi-led administration in 2009 at the sum of M150billion, while the administration was able to pay up to N30 Billion before the end of the tenure in 2015\n\nSince Amaechi left office, the project has been abandoned, with the current government led by Governor Nyesom Wike has alleging that the cost of the project compared to the cost of same projects in other states is outrageous.\n\nBut a few of the projects embarked upon by the Wike administration are also said to be unviable and non-impactful to residents of the state.\n\nAmong such projects are the Ecumenical commissioned in May 2017 to mark his second year in office. Six months after it was officially opened, no government or religious activities have taken place in the edifice. Others are the Rebisi and Okoro-Nu-Odo Flyovers located along Ikwerre road and the Trans-Kalabari road project.\n\nCritics in the state have continuously questioned Wike\u2019s decision to embark on such projects when primary health institutions and schools as well as rural roads were begging for attention.\n\nIn Niger State, some of the unviable abandoned projects scattered in the state are mostly those inherited from previous administrations.\n\nA typical example is the now abandoned multi-billion city centre model initiated by former Governor Babangida Aliyu.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that at over N5 billion was sunk into the project.\n\nThere is also the Minna Airport City Project which was estimated to cost a whopping $600 million.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Sani Bello has however said pointedly that there are no resources in the state now to complete such a project, insisting that the available resources in the state would instead be channeled to other viable areas.\n\nAnother mega project abandoned in the state is the Minna Hotel. The cost of the construction of the five-star hotel was put at N19.6 billion.\n\nAlthough the government had issued a bank guarantee of N1.4 billion and a land worth N400 million, it was observed that the hotel has remained as it was since former Governor Aliyu left office.\n\nAlso, Bayelsa International Hotel in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State and Enyimba International Hotel in Aba, Abia State, have suffered similar fate.\n\nOur investigation confirmed that although Bayelsa Hotel was one of the projects used by former Governor Timipre Sylva to secure a N50 billion loan from the capital market in December 2009, it is still an abandoned project.\n\nA report that was released by the Financial Management Review Committee, chaired by the former managing director, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Timi Alaibe, showed that the cost of the project was N13.9 billion.\n\nThe report also showed that the project was rated 26 percent completion when the bond was obtained.\n\nIn Cross River State, Governor Ben Ayade has been embarking on rather ambitious projects, some of which include the 276km super highway, 148km Nfum-Ogoja-Obudu Ranch Road, Eastern Boki-Western Boki Link Road, Bakassi Deep Seaport, Cross River Garment Factory; Calabar Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Company, Calabar International Convention Centre (CICC), Calabar Rice City, and the Calabar Monorail.\n\nFor Ayade, building a 32MW power plant in the state capital, Calabar, which is almost complete and promises to give the capital 24 hours uninterrupted power supply is a project that must be completed.\n\nIn addition, his administration has secured a $30 million Indian loan for another 26MW as well as the installation of 4MW power turbines in Obudu local government area.\n\nCompleted but not fully utilized projects in the state include Tinapa Business/Leisure Resort initiated by former governor Donald Duke and completed by Senator Liyel Imoke.\n\nOthers that have been abandoned are Lake Side Hotel, Cross River Water parks, the famous Obudu Cattle Ranch Resort, Obudu dam project, Cable car, the longest walk way in Africa, monorail , West Africa Teaching/ training Institute, State Library, State Toothpick Factory, Songhai Farms, Golf club, Bebie Airstrip among others .\n\nAirports are topical in the states of the South East, just as three states have embarked on airport projects with varying degrees of project implementation.\n\nThey are Abia, Anambra and Ebonyi States where the governors of the states speak with confidence about the desirability even imperative of the airports.\n\nThe project execution model for the Abia State airport is said to be a hermaphrodite, otherwise clothed in the garb of a Public-Private Partnership.\n\nIt was gathered that the state government has forcefully acquired lands in Ngwaland and Ikwuano and Olokoro, Umuahia for the project which was commenced by fromer Governor Theodore Orji.\n\nIncumbent Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has sworn to complete the project and has appointed an Abia Airport project team, with Chief Philip Orjiako as chairman.\n\nIn March 2020, Ikpeazu said he looked towards breaking grounds in April so he could realise the project before his administration expires.\n\nGovernor Willie Obiano is similarly committed to the building of an airport in Anambra State, or so he has claimed for three years since he unveiled the project in April 2017.\n\nLike Abia, construction of the Umueri International Cargo Airport is under a PPP arrangement.\n\nAnambra Airport City Infrastructures Limited oversees the project and has allocated 75 per cent equity to Elite International Investments, 20 per cent to Orient Petroleum Resources Limited and five per cent to Anambra State government. The initial claim was that Chinese firm, Sinoking International, would build the airport at no cost to the state government.\n\nThe People\u2019s Airport in Owerri is also one of the loss-makers. Built on a strong wave of populism and anger at marginalisation, the zeal of the people has not manifested in patronage at the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport. It generated revenue of N1.25bn over the three-years 2017-2019 but spent N2.50bn, losing N1.42b.\n\nIn Abia State for instance, the multi-billion naira proposed Enyimba Economic City (EEC) is another resource-consuming initiative and schemes which many have described as a means through which public funds are wasted.\n\nIn Kano State, a former candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC) candidate in the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election, Alhaji Bashir Tofa, had warned Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje that unviable projects were not needed in the state when the light rail project was proposed.\n\nThough the project which was contracted by China Railway Construction Corporation at a whopping $1.85 billion had the nod of the presidency and the National Assembly, Tofa did not welcome the plan to get loan from Chinese Development Bank for the project, contending that the project might not be of any profound value to Kano residents.\n\nTofa had also petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly, Debt Management Office (DMO) and Chinese government not to allow Kano government embark on a \u201cwhite elephant project\u201d that would rather enslave the state for the next 50 years.\n\nBut Ganduje argued that the light rail project was conceived out of genuine interest for the state\u2019s socio-economic development\n\nAmbitious projects in the state include the proposed Muhammad Buhari Bridge initiated by the present administration of Ganduje at the cost of over N9billion and the Kano integrated Modern Rail system.\n\nDelayed projects indentified in the state include the Kano hydro power project initiated by the Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso\u2019s administration to free the state of the manipulative tendency of KEDCO which is faulted for her inability to improved power supply where the former NEPA failed to.\n\nIn Edo state, one major project that may never see the light of day in the face of dwindling revenue allocations is the N30b Benin storm water project\n\nEven though the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki had in February 2021 declared that the multi-billion naira erosion control project embarked upon by his predecessor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, was a ploy to defraud the people of the state, the project has failed to meet it objective.\n\nObaseki had stated that the storm water project, conceived by the previous administration a fraud. It was a contract to defraud Edo people. From what I see in this catchment area, the project was never designed to take water away from the area. The area was never drained.\n\nDespite the fact that Osun State is one of the states with low revenue allocation from the federation account, there are evidence of the state embarking on mega projects that resources of government cannot cope with.\n\nOne mega project embarked upon by successive administrations and has been abandoned after huge amount of money has been invested was the Moshood Kashimawo Abiola International Airport located in Okinni, Egbedore local government of the state.\n\nThe project has its establishment dated as far back as 1936 during the regime of Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola.\n\nHowever, the project got priority attention during the administration of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola who renamed the site MKO Abiola International Airport and first awarded the contract for the reconstruction at #4.5billion, invested about N3.6 billion on it before reaching concessional N69 billion agreement with a company when it was obvious that government cannot find the project\n\nDespite this huge investment, presently, it has turned to habitat of herders and their flocks.\n\nProject execution is the robust suite of Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi who has demonstrated competence in delivering infrastructure in the state. Some of the projects are needful and others are futuristic such as the International Market in Abakaliki that is mostly empty.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that the water fountain and the decorative lights projects along major streets within the capital city has been described as unviable.\n\nAlthough abandoned projects are scattered in different parts of the country, the situation is slightly different in Lagos State.\n\nThis is because Lagos State since the inception of democratic governance in the country has been governed by the same party, making successive governments in the state to key into the development blueprint of the state.\n\nOvertime it has been discovered that deviation from the laid down blueprint of development in the state could cause any governor his seat.\n\nHowever one visible project that has taken so long to complete in the state is the Lagos Blue Line Rail project which is the flagship transport project of the Lagos State government.\n\nThe Blue Line project is a 27-kilometre rail route designed to run from Okokomaiko eastwards to Mile 2, and then proceeds to Marina via Ijora.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State the story is not different as the multibillion naira ICT Science park initiated by former governor Attah has been abandoned.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that the state government sunk over $150 million on the project before abandoning it, even as the incumbent, governor Udom Emmanuel has also abandoned it.",

          "text": "BY ABAH ADAH, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has invited applications from companies qualified to operate and maintain three state-run oil refineries.\n\nNNPC said Friday in a publication on its Tweeter handle that it was seeking to engage reputable and credible operations and maintenance companies to operate and maintain the Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna Refineries to ensure reliability and sustainability to meet the nation\u2019s fuel supply obligation.\n\nThe invitation for Expressions of Interest is coming nearly a month after the NNPC signed a contract with Italy\u2019s Maire Tecnimont for the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery.\n\nThe $1.5 billion contract was signed by the managing director of the Port Harcourt Refinery, Ahmed Dikko, and the vice president of Tecnimont, Sub-Saharan Africa, Davide Pellizola.\n\nThe signing indicated the contract for the repair of the 210,000 barrels per-day-refinery had taken off. The Federal Executive Council approved the contract in March, a decision many analysts criticised as wasteful.\n\nNigeria has four refineries owned by the government, but imports its refined petroleum products. The approval for the Port Harcourt Refinery was welcomed with mixed reactions as the country in the past spent billions of dollars on refinery maintenance with no success.\n\nThe NNPC has said the country does not have the required funds to build a new refinery. Mele Kyari, NNPC group managing director, said in April that building a new refinery would cost the country about $10 billion which is far beyond the $1.5 billion earmarked for the rehabilitation of Port Harcourt refinery.\n\nHe also said the country would have to live with importation of petroleum product, especially petrol, for another four years if the country ventures into building a new refinery.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn March, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, said the rehabilitation will be done in three phases of 18, 24 and 44 months.\n\nHe said the funding would be from many components including the NNPC, Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), budgetary provisions, and Afreximbank.\n\nThe minister also said a maintenance company would also be put in place to ensure an effective maintenance culture.\n\nIn its advertorial Friday, the NNPC said the scope of responsibilities for successful companies for the three refineries would cover long term and short term production/operations planning, production and operations execution, monitoring, reporting and optimization of operations, and more.",

          "text": "BY HENRY TYOHEMBA AND ABUBAKAR YUNUSA, Abuja\n\nRegistration exercise for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME) which started over a month ago is replete with issues of poor internet services as well as challenges faced by candidates in obtaining National Identity Number (NIN), checks by LEADERSHIP Weekend have revealed.\n\nAs a result, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is considering to postpone the 2021 and Direct Entry (DE) registration scheduled to hold from June 5 to 18.\n\nIt was gathered that the UTME candidates are still having difficulties obtaining their NIN due to the problem of generating the required codes that would enable them to set up profile codes using their unique national identification number (NIN).\n\nJAMB registrar, Prof Ishaq Oloyede, confirmed yesterday that the examination board was considering extending the exercise so as to accommodate candidates, who are yet to register.\n\nThe board had reported that about 600,000 prospective candidates, who have initiated the registration process, are yet to receive the required codes meant to be transported to their mobile lines by the network operators.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing session with stakeholders, Prof Oyedele noted that the significant number of prospective candidates who are yet to get their NIN may compel the board to shift the exams.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are holding this critical meeting to determine whether or not we should shift the examinations. This is primarily because of the introduction of NIN. A number of candidates have been complaining that their NIN has not been released by the agency responsible for that.\n\n\u201cFrom what we have seen, over 600,000 who had indicated interest have not been able to register. Today, we want to analyse why they have not been able to register after they have indicated interest, we will decide.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOloyede however said the mock exam which is slated to hold on Thursday will hold as scheduled.\n\nAccording to him, the essence of the mock examination is to enable the board to test its system and also enable candidates to test their ability.\n\nThe Registrar also disclosed that some changes have been made in the 2021 examination exercise, explaining that the candidate examinations slip now has two pictures, which are the photos of the candidate who registered for the examination and the owner of the NIN.\n\nNoting that both pictures are expected to be the same, he said the reason for adding two pictures is to expose any disparity.\n\nJAMB had recently promised to refund monies paid by candidates who were unable to generate profile codes due to poor network or delayed response from telecommunication service providers.\n\nThe examination body, however, warned that the refund would not apply to wrong registration in the case of candidates who entered wrong codes while trying to generate their profiles.\n\nBut some of the candidates who spoke with LEADERSHIP Weekend exclusively said the codes provided by JAMB for authenticating applicants\u2019 NIN after they had sent messages come with errors, indicating invalid NIN instead of the profile codes.\n\nIn separate interviews with our correspondent, they urged the government to provide a conducive environment for candidates to be able to meet up with the deadline.\n\nOne of the candidates, Iganya Asiya Muhammed, said the board does not have any reason to keep suffering candidates, especially when the UTME is a yearly programme that requires the exam body to prepare well.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe first day the agency made the announcement that their registration would commence, I went to the registration centre at Kogi State College of Education, Ankpa, but I couldn\u2019t do anything despite wasting the whole day there.\n\n\u201cOn the second day nothing changed. Everything seemed to be the same. When we approached the staff to ask them what was happening they said they were setting up our computer but the network was not good and the site was misbehaving. So, we were asked to come the next day only for us to see breaking news that JAMB has postponed the registration of UTME till further notice. I was frustrated. Why would the agency do such a thing?",

          "text": "Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, on Friday, warned his counterparts from Southern Nigeria against fighting the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) or blaming him for the problems of the country.\n\nThe governor, who spoke while featuring on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH, said the President has restructured the country by granting judicial, legislative and local government autonomy, amongst others.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that about 17 southern governors met on Tuesday in Asaba, Delta State, and resolved to ban open grazing and movement of cattle by foot in the region. The governors called for the restructuring of the country along fiscal federalism, devolution of powers and state policing. They also called on the President to address the nation and convoke a national dialogue to address widespread agitations amongst various groups in the region.\n\nBut speaking on the television programme, Bello warned the governors to be careful of their utterances so as not heat up the polity.\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me caution each and every one of us, leaders across board including governors and all of the leaders across Nigeria that we should be careful about the words we use. When we are talking of security, unity and national cohesion of Nigeria, as leaders and politicians, we should be careful about the words we use when we are addressing these various topical issues.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about restructuring or the various demands or resolutions put across by my colleagues from the South, they are quite germane and they are entitled to their opinions and I so respect it but when it is titled or when it appears as if you are fighting President Muhammadu Buhari, our father and our President, we are all getting it wrong because we get to where we are today as a result of maladministration of successive administrations.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the governor said, \u201cThere have been collective failures across board, so let\u2019s not just blame it alone on the federal government or Mr President alone.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk of restructuring, Mr President believes in restructuring, I believe in restructuring, all of us believe in restructuring but when we are talking of restructuring, from what angle to what? Which context?\n\n\u201cI will describe my own context about restructuring that first, from what Mr President has done by ensuring signing Order 10 signing autonomy to local governments, legislature and judiciary. That is restructuring. How made of us are practising all of these in our states? How many of us have given full autonomy to local governments? Mr President has signed it.\u201d\n\nBello challenged the governors to start the change they want to see from their states by granting judicial and local government autonomy in their domains.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt various levels, whatever we are demanding, let us make sure we practise it at home. If we are demanding zoning, let\u2019s make sure we start the zoning from home, if we are demanding equity, let\u2019s make sure there is equity at home. If we are demanding fairness, let\u2019s make sure there is fairness at home. If we are demanding good governance, let\u2019s start good governance at home.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who hinted that his ambition to run for President in the 2023 elections, also knocked the Southern governors for banning open grazing without providing ranches for herders, adding that the insecurity arising from farmers-herders crisis was political.\n\nThe rising criminality amongst herders had forced about 20 states in the country to ban open grazing. Some farmers in Southern Nigeria have been killed, raped, and kidnapped by criminal elements who masquerade as herders. Many farmers had since abandoned their farms as a result of fear of unknown attacks by criminal herders who invade farmlands, brazenly destroy investments worth millions of naira while their cattle feed on crops and scuttle months of farmers\u2019 labour.\n\nBello, whose state has not banned open grazing, stressed that herders should be allowed to co-habit with other Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have not banned open grazing in Kogi State because there is no provision for ranching,\u201d the governor said, even as he agreed that open grazing was \u201carchaic and outdated\u201d.Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "$65m Fraud: Presidency \u2018Denies\u2019 Ex-FMBN Boss As Buhari\u2019s Son-In-Law, PDP Demands Probe",
          "text": "Gimba Yau Kumo, a former Managing Director of the Federal Mortgage Bank who has been declared wanted for a $65 million scam, is no longer a son-in-law of President Muhammadu Buhari, according to the Presidency (retd.).\n\nThis comes as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) demands an investigation into Kumo, who married Buhari\u2019s daughter in Daura, Katsina State, in October 2016.\n\nThe fugitive was wanted along with Tarry Rufus and Bola Ogunsola by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission for suspected theft and disbursement of the national housing money.\n\nMrs Azuka Ogugua, the commission\u2019s spokesman, signed the notice that was posted on the ICPC website.\n\nDuring Kumo\u2019s time at FMBN, he was dogged by suspicions of corruption.\n\nWhen he was still at the bank in April, the Senate Committee on Public Accounts called him to explain the alleged unlawful award of a N3 billion contract.\n\nGarba Shehu, the President\u2019s Senior Special Assistant for Media and Publicity, claimed the fugitive\u2019s contact with the President\u2019s daughter terminated years ago, notwithstanding the mockery and criticism that followed the media stories on Kumo.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, titled, \u2018ICPC fugitive is not the President\u2019s in-law,\u2019 Shehu also argued that the move to arrest Kumo was an affirmation that \u201cour anti-corruption agencies/institutions are truly independent and allowed unfettered freedom by the President.\u201d\n\nThe statement read, \u201cA running story to the effect that the ICPC haas declared \u201can in-law of the President\u201d wanted in connection with fraud involving the large sum of money USD65 million to be exact.\n\n\u201cThis should normaly be an affirmation that our anti-corruption agencies/institutions are truly independent and allowed unfettered freedom by the President. Which infact is the case.\n\n\u201cThat a state institution can issue such is a measure of the administration\u2019s commitment to accountability, equality and justice.\n\n\u201cTo set the records straight, the person declared wanted by the ICPC is not an in-law to President Buhari.\n\n\u201cWhile at some point in time, the said fugitive from justice had been linked to a family member in marriage, that relationship has ended some years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unfortunate to bring the President\u2019s family into this case. It is in our view, an attempt to generate views and sell copies of sensational reporting.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the President\u2019s position at all times was that the law be allowed to take its course.\n\n\u201cAs is well known of him, President Muhammadu Buhari will not provide any cover for crime, no matter who is involved,\u201d Shehu stressed.\n\nBut the PDP urged the ICPC to expedite action in tracking down Kumo.\n\nThe opposition party said the alleged involvement of a son-in-law to the President in the alleged heist was further confirmation that the Buhari Presidency is \u201ca sanctuary for fraudsters, treasury looters and common criminals.\u201d\n\nThis was contained in a statement titled, \u2018$65m Fraud: Track Down Buhari\u2019s Son in-law, PDP Charges ICPC\u2026Urges Presidency to Allow For Open Investigation,\u2019 signed by the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja, on Friday.\n\nThe PDP said, \u201cThe latest revelation of $65 million (N31 billion) fraud in the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria , in which President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s son in-law, Gimba Kumo, is reportedly involved, further confirms that the Buhari Presidency is indeed a sanctuary for fraudsters, treasury looters and common criminals.\n\n\u201cThe ICPC should not succumb to reported pressure from the cabal in the Buhari Presidency but track down Yau Kumo, the former Managing Director of the FMBN, who had already been declared wanted, and bring him to book alongside his accomplices.\n\n\u201cIt speaks volumes that the Buhari Presidency had remained silent in the face of this huge fraud involving Mr. President\u2019s son in-law; a beneficiary of the primitive family patronage in the Buhari administration, only for certain members of the cabal to be reportedly mounting pressure on the ICPC to let him off the hook.\u201d\n\nThe party accused the ruling All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government of wickedness.\n\nIt said the administration was denting millions of hardworking Nigerians basic necessities due to its misrule and corruption, \u201creports of which have become a daily occurrence.\u201d\n\nIThe statement further read, \u201cIt is even more distressing that the looted FMBN money is part of funds contributed by Nigerians to meet their home needs which has instead fallen under the predatory proclivities of the APC administration.\u201d\n\nThe party asserts that Nigerians can now see that while the Buhari Presidency parades a \u201cholier than thou attitude\u201d, the nation\u2019s vaults have been laid open for the ruthless pillaging by family members, relations, cronies in the Buhari Presidency.\n\nHowever, the Buhari Media Organisation said the PDP was the least qualified to speak about the anti-corruption fight of the Buhari-led Administration.\n\nThe Chairman of the organisation, Niyi Akinsiju, said, \u201cThe 16 years the PDP spent in power were years of waste, corruption was the order of the day and it was treated as a family affair.\u201d",

          "title": "Additional polling units: INEC\u2019s leap, citizens\u2019 confidence",
          "text": "Polling units (PUs) remain essential in every democratic electoral process. This is largely because it is the last channel via which citizens exercise their constitutional right, vote and be voted for. With limited polling units across the country, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE take a look at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC\u2019s) decision to create additional polling units nationwide.\n\nPUs then and now\n\nThe law guiding elections in Nigeria, the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), which defines a polling unit as \u201cthe place, enclosure, booth, shade or house at which voting takes place under this Act\u201d (Section 156-interpretation), also empowers INEC to establish adequate number of PUs in the country and to assign voters to them. This is explicitly stated in Section 42 of the Act, thus: \u201cThe Commission shall establish a sufficient number of polling units in each registration area and allot voters to such PUs.\u201d\n\nHowever, since 1996 when the defunct National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) established the current 119,973 existing polling units to serve no fewer than 50 million registered voters and with 700 per units, INEC since its establishment in 1998 has not increased the number of the polling units despite an increase in the population of registered voters.\n\nAs the population of registered voters continued to increase, like it was witnessed in 2019 when it rose to 84,004,084, many political stakeholders have lent their voices to the creation of additional polling units for voter access.\n\nNotably, INEC attempted to create additional polling units in 2007, when the Commission created what it named baby units in the FCT. These baby units were an offshoot of the existing units which are located in the area of need.\n\nSimilarly, as contained in INEC\u2019s 2021 discussion paper the State of Voter Access to Polling Units in Nigeria, it in 2011 also introduced voting point; this is a voters grouping system that enables the Commission to re-group large polling units into smaller clusters (voting points) to ease voting. Though this has been accepted by most Nigerians and all stakeholders, the smaller clusters, voting points, over the years have failed to address the problem of low voter turn-out which is largely caused by the inability of many to travel to their PUs as the election movement restrictions and in some cases crowded PUs.\n\nThe last attempt was in 2014 during the build-up to the 2015 general elections, when the Commission proposed an additional 30, 070 new polling units. Unfortunately, it jettisoned the idea and reverted to the use of a voting point for the 2015 general elections over what it described as \u201cunfounded allegations and negative propaganda\u201d from some sections of the media.\n\nNationwide verification exercise\n\nThe Commission on May 4, this year, commenced a nationwide verification exercise for centres proposed for voting units to be converted to polling units.\n\nIts chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this when he visited some of the proposed centres and existing polling units in the FCT and Nasarawa state, said the purpose of the verification exercise was to ensure that the right thing was done in the conversion of the voting points to polling units.\n\nHe also said, \u201cAll the national commissioners are out, visiting the states of the federation to verify the work of converting the voting points to polling units.\n\n\u201cSo, we decided from the headquarters to visit some of the polling units and voting points in the FCT and also in the Karu local government area, Nasarawa state. You will recall that as part of our engagement with stakeholders, we show images of one of the congested polling units in the country from Karu in Nasarawa state.\n\n\u201cSo, I have to verify that the right thing is being done in converting those voting points to polling units and relocating them in line with the Commission\u2019s guidelines.\u201d\n\nNeed for expansion\n\nThe Commission stated that the objective of expanding the polling unit is to address low voter turn-out, among others. The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Jigawa state, Dr. Mahmuda Isah, said this recently at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on expanding voter access to polling units in Dutse.\n\nIsah said other objectives are to improve the health safety conditions at polling units in compliance with Covid-19 protocol during the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe expansion, according to him, is also to digest existing polling units by reducing the number of voters per polling unit and ensure better access at polling units for persons with disability.\n\n\u201cA practical review conducted by the Commission in 2014 revealed that many polling units recorded an excess number of voters. Some units exceeded the designated figure of 500 voters per polling unit to a couple of over 4,000 registered voters,\u201d he said.\n\nIPAC\u2019s reaction\n\nIn his reaction, the chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, said the creation of additional polling units \u201cwill make the job of political parties easier.\u201d\n\nNzenwa in a phone chat with this reporter said, \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction. It must be done with sincerity of purpose to capture all stakeholders that this time around, the areas that were not captured will be captured this time. Why we need additional polling units is something that is welcome. We had a population of fewer than 50 million voters in 2015 and we now have 85 million.\n\n\u201cWe have had an increase in prospective voters, so additional polling units are also required to take care of this number of voters. So, it\u2019s a step in the right direction and done to accommodate those not captured previously. To IPAC, it\u2019s a welcome development.\u201d\n\nOn what benefits additional polling units will bring for the political parties and the electorates, Nzenwa said, \u201cFor the electorates, it will make access to polling units easier. In the past, we had people travelling more than two kilometres to get to polling units. Now, the polling units will be closer to most of the electorates.\n\n\u201cFor political parties, it will make their job easier. When you have the polling unit closer to the electorate, the task of creating awareness and directing the electorate to vote becomes easier. In terms of the larger stakeholder, it will restore some level of confidence and make them partake actively in the electoral process and to deepen our democracy.\u201d\n\nOn the fears of effective management and transparency, the IPAC boss noted that, \u201cA grown-up woman will surely get married one day, get pregnant and deliver a baby. She cannot ignore any of the above because of pains. Therefore, because of fears and deep concerns, we cannot be stagnated. We have to move on. We can\u2019t get everything perfectly one day. It\u2019s usual experimentation until we get there. The increase in voters registration is a clear indication that people want to cast their vote.\n\n\u201cSo, do we on account of fears remain at the level we had less than 120,000 polling units. It doesn\u2019t make sense. As we have more voters, there is a need to open up space and create polling units closer to them. Fears are welcome and justified, but we must find a way to grow our democracy, which is growing our polling units, which is a crucial aspect of our democracy.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 views\n\nMeanwhile, a political analyst, Jide Ojo, has said \u201cif INEC successfully creates additional polling units it will guarantee better voter access.\u201d\n\nOjo, in a telephone chat with Blueprint Weekend, said, \u201cAdditional polling units, in my considered view, are long overdue. If stakeholders can agree with INEC, it will guarantee better voter access.\n\n\u201cThe last time we created polling units was in 1996, that\u2019s 25 years ago. All attempts to create additional polling units have not been successful. Professor Attahiru Jega, when he was INEC chairman, did try to create 30,000 polling units but it was resisted on the excuse that the South-South People Assembly led by Chief Edwin Clark felt it was lopsided in favour of the north against the south. We have had to live with that decision up till now.\n\n\u201cBetween 1996 till now, the expansion has not taken place up till now. If you look at Abuja, as of 1996, it was barely 6 years after the relocation of the capital from Lagos to FCT. Abuja was a jungle then.\u201d\n\nHe said further that, \u201cIf we continue to work on the polling units that were available then, it means a lot of people will be disenfranchised. That has warranted a low voter turnout. During election time, the economy will be shut down. If you registered far away from home or workplace, you will not find it easy going to vote. INEC made it a policy to vote where you were registered.\n\n\u201cThis is to guarantee better voter access. CSOs and the media should be able to follow up to ensure we don\u2019t end up having polling units in the jungle or traditional ruler\u2019s palaces or awkward places. Polling units have to be sited in neutral places, away from residences. I wish INEC could imitate Egypt and come up with a policy to site polling units in only public schools. Those are neutral places no one can lay claim to and not residential areas that politicians can manipulate and lay claim to. You can have up to 10 polling units in a particular school for convenience, it\u2019s all about demarcation.\u201d\n\nOn the impact the additional polling units would have on the 2023 general elections, Ojo said, \u201cAhead of 2023, if it is concluded on time for INEC to sensitise people, it will be good because there is the advantage of voter access. It will guarantee more people access to polling units. However, the implication is that your name will no longer reflect where you used to vote before as a result of the creation of these additional polling units. This is because many people will register during Continuous Voter Registration; so, INEC will distribute them according to alphabetical orders. So, those voting in a particular polling unit since 1999 may experience a shift to another polling unit.\n\n\u201cSo, there will be a need for public enlightenment for people to check their names and where they will henceforth be voting. That has to be done well ahead of 2023, particularly in states that will be having bye-election and governorship elections. That will also increase voter turn-out if the exercise is done successfully.\u201d\n\nLimited manipulations\n\nAnother analyst, Aminu Mohammed, is of the view that additional polling units will heighten voter confidence in the nation\u2019s electoral process, INEC and that manipulations will be limited.\n\nMohammed told this reporter that, \u201cSo many of us, for so many years, have been clamouring for the creation of additional polling units even though a few in the past came up with propaganda to stall the plan some years ago. But today, especially to those who care about our democracy, it is obvious that with an increase in registered voters there is certainly a need for creating additional polling units.\n\n\u201cWe have about 120,000 polling units with some voting points, but yet many Nigerians are disenfranchised as a result of long-distance polling units, crowded polling units and others. So, to show that INEC and other stakeholders care about the growth of Nigeria democracy, then they must work to solve the problem of low voter turn-out due to limited polling units. And the best way to address this is by creating additional polling units.\n\n\u201cWhen additional units are created it means more people, if not all registered voters will vote. It will give voters easy access, make voting more convenient and even enable the process to be more transparent. Instead of having over 700 voters in a polling unit, with additional units, smaller voters will exercise their constitutional rights in units.\n\n\u201cThis also means an increase in voter turn-out, small number per polling units, speedy process and limited manipulation. When there is a fewer number per polling unit, security personnel, observers, party agents and other stakeholders will be able to do their work effectively to limit electoral manipulation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFor political parties and their candidates, with additional polling units, they will spend more money to mobilise agents and station them in those polling units. But it will also help them.\n\n\u201cIf more polling units are created, voters will know that stakeholders and INEC want them to have a say and exercise their right to vote in or out political leaders. So, the creation of additional polling units will boost the voter confidence in INEC and will also enable the process to be more transparent.\u201d\n\nAPC chieftain\u2019s take\n\nWhen asked for his reaction, a foundation member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the director-general, Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, said the on-going creation of more polling units by the INEC \u201cis a welcome development.\u201d\n\nExpressing confidence in the current leadership of the electoral body, he said having more polling units \u201cwill demolish collation centre banditry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have implicit confidence in Prof. Mahmood Yakubu leadership of INEC, especially in their upgrade of electoral management. They have demolished collation centre bandits, by popping up polling units on their platform. In this vein, one supports the creation of additional polling units as our population increases.\n\n\u201cI know of many wards that witnessed increase in population and migration for one reason or the other. Such wards need to have more polling units,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: How special needs students are struggling against the Nigerian educational system",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 5\n\nBy: Olatunji Olaigbe\n\nOn the 20th of March, 2021, Jamiu Jibril, a visually impaired student sat to write his Master\u2019s entrance examination at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ilorin. He had an aid who read out the questions and wrote down his answers for him, and like the non-special needs student sitting for the exam, he was given two and half hours.\n\nThroughout Jibril\u2019s academic journey, he has had to depend on the goodwill of other students and his extra-thrust for knowledge to go through school. The University of Ilorin, the same tertiary institution he got his graduate degree from, never provided him with special needs resources.\n\nHe remembers going to the university\u2019s center for special students one day and being told \u201cthe center was for deaf students, and not the blind. Everything I did, every assistance I got, was on me,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nLike Jibril, special needs students in Nigerian tertiary institutions struggle against myriads of problems in the quest for education.\n\nIn a research by Abubakar Ahmed, Zakaria Al-Cheikh Mahmoud Awad, and Mastura Adam; Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and Kano University of Science and Technology (KUST) were scored 26.7% and 13.3% respectively in their accessibility to the mobility impaired, noting: \u201cOnly 272 special schools, homes, centers, and integrated school cater for the education of Special needs children in Nigeria; a country whose Persons living With Disability (PWD) population was put at 19 million. Only 10% of the over 19 million disabled are receiving education in Nigerian educational environment.\u201d\n\nThe 272 represents a totality of both special needs institutions, built specifically for special needs students, and seemingly \u201cinclusive\u201d institutions \u2013 meaning they provide education for non-special needs and special needs students. But how true is the statement?\n\nIn the University of Ibadan, the department of special education is a two-storey building with no ramps or supportive devices for special students other than the auditorily impaired. This makes it hard for students with other forms of disability to move around the building, getting education.\n\nTola Alli, NewsWire.\n\n\u201cMobility impaired students have to stick to the lower floors and in unavoidable cases, they have to find someone who can assist them up the stairs\u201d, says Nimi, a student of the department. \u201cEven non-disabled students have issues getting education in the University, imagine what it\u2019s like having a disability with that.\u201d\n\nThe presence of PWDs in an institution does not directly translate into true inclusivity. Most institutions lack resources and infrastructure for special needs students. For Jibril, who has visited several institutions while representing his faculty, the University of Jos is the most special needs-friendly institution he\u2019s seen, scoring 50% by his own discretion. \u201cThe University of Lagos could be scoring 80%, because they have a lot of resources and infrastructure, but they lack the motive to use these resources.\u201d\n\nA special needs-friendly institution for an auditorily impaired student can still be non-friendly to a mobility impaired, or a visually impaired student.\n\nIn the university of Benue, Akin, an auditorily-impaired student struggles in comprehending what is being taught because the university has no audio-to-sign language interpreter.\n\nAt the University of Ilorin, Victor, another auditorily impaired student of Computer Science Education faces a different shade of the same problem. The University of Ilorin provides interpreters, \u201cbut there are not enough,\u201d says Victor. Citing that this places a lot of stress on the available interpreters. He added, \u201csometimes, the available interpreter is not familiar with me or the course being taught, [and then] misinterpretations happen.\u201d For him, just as it is for every other student, getting what is being taught right is the tiny margin between a hardworking student and an intelligent one.\n\nQuoting the answers to research questions by Education Data, Research, and Evaluation Nigeria (EDOREN):\n\nThe schools have facilities that meet the needs of all learners, such as separate toilets for girls, ramps (not stairs) for learners with physical disabilities and tactile floor guide: NO\n\n\u201cTeachers have high expectations for ALL children, believe they all can learn and encourage them to complete school: NO\n\nTeachers know about the conditions that cause physical, emotional, and learning disabilities; and can help learners to get proper care: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nLearners are involved to actively participate and develop guidelines/rules in the school to improve inclusion, reduce discrimination, violence and abuse: NO\u201d.\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nIn place of the margin between literate and non-literate PWDs in Nigeria, the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) implemented a policy encouraging institutions to make 10% of their population PWDs, \u201cbut I can assure you that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria introduced the National Policy on Special Needs Education, its first document fully dedicated to the interests of people with special needs.\n\nIn 2016, it also introduced the National Policy on Inclusive Education, which aimed to provide education to everyone. Promising to \u201coffer a quality education for all while respecting diversity\u201d. The policy defined itself as \u201cabout removing barriers to learning and involving all learners who otherwise would have been excluded through marginalization and segregation.\u201d\n\nOn 17th, January 2019, President Muhammed Buhari signed the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act \u2013 even promising the conversion of existing building structures into inclusive ones.\n\nBut most of these policies are lost in transition, not being translated into actions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for more inclusivity policies, but more need for the enforcing of already existing policies. There\u2019s a need for institutions to improve on their inclusivity.\u201d says Dr. Azubike Onuora-Oguno, a Teaching Research Fellow on Human Rights Law and Society at the International Institute of Social Sciences, Netherlands. And a senior project manager of the Disability Law Advocacy Project \u2013 an Open Society Initiative of West Africa (OSIWA) project aimed to make academic curriculums in Nigerian Universities special needs friendly.\n\nThe majority of problems come from the government, but the public has a part to play too. \u201cWe all have an obligation to accommodate PWDs, but this can\u2019t happen until we understand the concept. Parents, people have to understand that PWDs are humans, meant to be acknowledged as such,\u201d says Dr. Azuibike. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s a need for deep-seated sensitization that will make us act reasonably towards PWDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need understanding, EMPATHY, not SYMPATHY,\u201d types Abiola Dada, a special needs student at the University of Ilorin.\n\nJibril is a broadcaster at Royal FM, Ilorin, and when Jibril isn\u2019t busy with work or academics, he tutors other students in his Faculty. \u201cOn most days, the university is crowded. There\u2019s the bus fight, students literally gnawing their way through the queue. What happens to me? Do I sleep in school?\u201d Asks Jibril.",
          "summary": "He remembers going to the university\u2019s center for special students one day and being told \u201cthe center was for deaf students, and not the blind.\nLike Jibril, special needs students in Nigerian tertiary institutions struggle against myriads of problems in the quest for education.\nOnly 10% of the over 19 million disabled are receiving education in Nigerian educational environment.\u201dThe 272 represents a totality of both special needs institutions, built specifically for special needs students, and seemingly \u201cinclusive\u201d institutions \u2013 meaning they provide education for non-special needs and special needs students.\nMost institutions lack resources and infrastructure for special needs students.\nIn 2015, Nigeria introduced the National Policy on Special Needs Education, its first document fully dedicated to the interests of people with special needs.",

          "title": "Murder in Uyo: Who Killed Hiny Umoren?",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 15\n\nOn Friday April 29, a 26 year-old lady set out around 1PM to attend a job interview in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Having recently completed her university program despite losing both parents, she was looking for a way to support herself before being called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) program.\n\nInstead of a job interview and hope for the future however, what she would actually encounter on that day would become one of the most shocking stories to ever emerge from Nigeria.\n\nY'all my friend @HinyHumoren is in trouble and she needs our help.\n\nI'm currently in Lagos and I can't help than to put this out there.\n\nEarlier today she told me she was going for a job interview at airport road which is quite far from her house. pic.twitter.com/X1YBLUPO7d \u2014 Happiness Activist #justiceforHinyUmoren (@UmohUduak1) April 29, 2021\n\nIniobong \u201cHiny\u201d Umoren became the subject of a desperate nationwide search led by Nigerian Twitter users after her friend Umoh Uduak put out an urgent appeal. She was eventually found, but unfortunately the worst had already happened. The police would later confirm that she was found dead, having been raped, murdered and then buried in a shallow grave.\n\nIn the wake of a crowdsourced social media sleuthing campaign which uncovered his identity, a primary suspect Frank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan was also arrested.\n\nIn a manner completely uncharacteristic of Nigeria\u2019s elephant-paced justice system, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command rapidly announced that it had extracted a confession from Akpan, and even identified his motive \u2013 he was a serial rapist and serial killer acting alone. End of story and job done.\n\nNaturally, this neat explanation did not satisfy many, who felt that Akpan could not have acted alone, and that the police might be involved in some kind of a cover up to protect powerful people potentially implicated. Rumours also began swirling about Hiny\u2019s family receiving death threats, and the suspect allegedly boasting about being well-connected.\n\nBeyond the whispers however, there has been precious little to substantiate the idea that stringing up Frank Akpan alone would not represent any kind of justice for Hiny Umoren. Sources willing to speak up and provide information about this case have generally not been forthcoming.\n\nUntil now.\n\nGame Changing Information\n\nEvery telephone conversation made via a GSM telephone line has a permanent record with the mobile service provider, which by law cannot be tampered with or erased. The information captured can vary, but it always includes the following elements: the date and time the interaction was initiated; the type of interaction (voice or SMS); the length of the interaction; the number initiating the interaction; the number receiving the interaction and the location of the closest cell towers to both parties.\n\nSome networks also record the actual conversation (voice note), and depending on the type of signal band and mobile device, it is even possible to capture the exact location of both parties, accurate to within a few metres. Anyone who can get their hands on the call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s line would very quickly be able to establish whether he was in fact acting alone \u2013 which is where my source came in handy.\n\nUnderstandably, this information is meant to be impossible to access without law enforcement authorisation. With this in mind, I have taken the extra precaution of reproducing it manually via a spreadsheet, so as to protect my source by removing all possible identifying information. Over the course of several hours last week, I pored over several days worth of leaked call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s mobile provider to make sense of the situation.\n\nWhat will be presented in this story is the closest thing that exists to objective evidence that:\n\n1.) Frank Akpan is being used to take the fall for much bigger fish involved in Hiny Umoren\u2019s murder; and\n\n2.) While Frank Akpan is certainly the primary suspect and was directly involved in the murder, there are other participants in the murder still walking free, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command intentionally bungles what should be an open and shut investigation.\n\nWho is Frank Akpan?\n\nApart from a few tidbits pieced together from social media accounts about him, very little is known about Frank Akpan the primary suspect. The timeline to his arrest begins late in the afternoon on April 29, when Umoh puts out Hiny\u2019s number hoping someone will be able to track down her friend\u2019s location.\n\nThe mention of \u201cFrank Akpan\u201d as a central figure in this story begins with this tweet from Umoh which identifies the owner of the Airtel number +2348127530092 as the person who invited Hiny for the supposed interview.\n\nA quick check with Truecaller brings up the name \u201cEzekiel Akpan.\u201d Curiously, the occupation tag on this person\u2019s Truecaller profile reads \u201cPolitical.\u201d It is important to bear in mind that Truecaller fills an individual\u2019s \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018occupation\u2019 fields by pulling high quality data from several sources including Facebook profile information and analysis of the individual\u2019s Facebook friend networks \u2013 so this tiny detail will become significant later on.\n\nShortly after finding himself under instant national scrutiny following Umoh\u2019s tweet, Akpan then attempts to throw the public off the scent with the Facebook post below. In so doing, he inadvertently confirms that the telephone number in question is actually his, thereby proving that \u201cUduak Frank Akpan\u201d and \u201cEzekiel Akpan\u201d are the same person.\n\nShortly thereafter, he deactivates his Facebook profile and seemingly goes silent until the Akwa Ibom State Police Command issues a statement 3 days later, confirming his arrest and effectively pronouncing him guilty of the crime as a sole suspect.\n\nFrank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan\n\nSo far, based on the version of the story that is in official circulation, there is only Frank Akpan and the unfortunate Hiny Umoren. The police have declared him a serial rapist \u2013 and hence a single actor. Officially, the issue is over and there is nothing more to see here. It was just a horrible monster and a woman who unfortunately fell victim under the most heartbreaking circumstances.\n\nThe only counter-story so far boils down to a few unsubstantiated social media rumours that cannot stand in court, plus what would otherwise be compelling evidence from Akpan\u2019s crime scene, which unfortunately has now been contaminated and rendered all but useless for the purpose of a criminal investigation.\n\nUduak Frank Akpan specialized in luring and kidnapping job seekers, youth Corp members, students and pupils, killing them, cutting off their sensitive parts, bury them in shallow graves then exhume their bones after decaying to sell off for more rituals#JusticeForHinyUmoren pic.twitter.com/BeexbP11wf \u2014 DR.PENKING\u2122 #JusticeForHinyUmoren (@drpenking) May 7, 2021\n\nBy deliberate malfeasance or by incompetence, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has allowed key evidence from Akpan\u2019s hideout potentially pointing to a larger conspiracy, to be trampled underfoot by hundreds of curious onlookers and social media content creators. In so doing, the evidence to build a case for anything other than a standalone Frank Akpan conviction has been destroyed or rendered inadmissible.\n\nThere is however, one type of evidence that cannot be physically destroyed or tampered with in any way. This evidence has a permanent digital record which sits in cloud storage away from the incompetence or malfeasance of the Nigeria Police Force, and what it shows without a shadow of doubt is that Frank Akpan did not act alone.\n\nLeaked Network Records: The Smoking Gun\n\nTo properly understand and contextualise the data that you are about to see below, a little explainer is in order. As mentioned earlier, the 6 categories of telephone interaction data always recorded by service providers are call date and time, originating number, receiving number, type of interaction (call or SMS), length of interaction (in seconds) and the originating/receiving cell tower.\n\nEvery cell tower on earth has a unique location code written in this format: MCC (Mobile Country Code)-MNC (Mobile Network Code)-LAC (Location Area Code)-CellID. Nigeria\u2019s mobile country code is 621, and its 4 largest network providers MTN, Glo, Airtel and 9Mobile have the respective MNCs 30, 50, 20 and 60. Using this information alongside the LAC and CellID provided in the call records below, you can pinpoint the exact cell tower closest to where the call in question was made or received.\n\nFor example, if the given MCC is 621, the MNC is 20 (Airtel), the LAC is 00784, and the CellID is 20565, you can put this information into free public access cell site locators like cell2gps.com and the result will be a cell tower site in Uyo at the junction of Ikot-Ekpene road and Ikpa Road.\n\nThis is actual cell site data from a call made by Frank Akpan at 6.50PM on April 29, 2021\n\nThat being said, it is time to examine the leaked call record data and draw our conclusions. First, here is data I extracted from what my source provided, showing the significant parts of Frank Akpan\u2019s call and SMS history on the day Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nFor ease of understanding, I ran all the numbers through Truecaller and put the names in brackets next to them\n\nAround 1.17PM on April 29, Frank Akpan placed a call to Hiny Umoren, which lasted for 124 seconds. It is fair to extrapolate that this was a call where he gave directions to her regarding where she should go for the purported interview. At 1.21PM, he then placed a call to a Blessing Godwin, which lasted 147 seconds. Was he chatting up another potential victim of the same job interview snare? It is impossible to say for now.\n\nAt 3:38PM, Hiny Umoren then placed a call to Frank Akpan lasting for 106 seconds. If you compare the cell tower data here to that of his previous phone calls, it is clear that he was already at the supposed venue waiting for her because the tower location does not change. It is safe to assume that she was calling to tell him that she had arrived for her interview. Save for a 2-second WhatsApp voice note which Hiny later managed to send to Umoh, this call was probably the last time anyone ever heard Hiny Umoren alive again.\n\nAround 6.15PM, almost 3 hours after Hiny Umoren arrived at his lair, Frank Akpan then placed a call to an unknown number. The call records clearly show +2348127530092 \u2013 Frank Akpan\u2019s known public number \u2013 making repeated contact between 6.15PM and 6.50PM with +2348122386922, an unknown number which brings up no details on Truecaller or Facebook. For reference, if a mobile number pulls up no Truecaller, Facebook or social media results whatsoever, this could either mean that it is used on a non-internet-enabled feature phone (a so-called \u2018burner\u2019 phone), or that the owner is extremely intentional about having no digital footprint linked to that number.\n\nIncidentally, this was also around the time when the Twitter hashtag #FindHinyUmoren had already led Twitter sleuths to uncover Frank Akpan\u2019s identity, leading to his amateur attempt at misdirection referenced earlier. In the middle of a clear and obvious crisis moment, why was Frank Akpan repeatedly trying to establish contact with this unknown number with no digital footprint? The answer could lie in some data I extracted from a different set of call records showing Frank Akpan\u2019s contact with this number in the days and weeks before Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nThis unknown person contacted Frank Akpan no fewer than 12 times between April 4 and April 27\n\nWas this a regular buyer or facilitator of whatever gruesome trade Frank Akpan was involved in? Was Frank calling him for help after an unexpected social media campaign suddenly exposed him and put their entire business operation at risk? Why was this the first number that Frank called immediately after raping and murdering a young woman? We do not know the answers to these questions, but there is at least one person other than Frank Akpan himself who can probably tell us.\n\nThe \u201cSenior Forestry Officer\u201d\n\nIt is April 30, 2021, and Frank Akpan has become a nationwide hate figure on social media. His involvement in Hiny Umoren\u2019s disappearance is public knowledge at this point, and time is running out for him. He needs friends and allies to protect him \u2013 and fast. His name and picture are doing the rounds on social media, and in a city like Uyo, it will not be long before someone recognises him and he finds himself subjected to Nigerian street justice.\n\nBetween 10.27Am and 10.44AM, he places 3 phone calls to a Francisca Bassey Akpan \u2013 Francisca is in Calabar when she receives the calls, and she is using a smartphone in a location with high network capacity, which means the network is able to record her location while receiving Frank\u2019s calls to within a few metres of accuracy.\n\nAt 10.55AM, Francisca calls Frank back. Only they and the mobile network know what is said during this 51-second conversation. My source balked at the idea of obtaining customer voice notes because that would simply be a bridge too far, even for the sake of solving a brutal murder. Just getting this much information to me is already breaking multiple in-house rules and NCC codes, so they understandably did not want to push their luck.\n\nAt 4.32PM on April 30, Frank then makes one of the most most interesting phone calls in this entire story. Truecaller pulls up the details of the recipient of the phone call with the number +23480*****326 \u2013 one \u201cKufre Effiong.\u201d Unlike the other people Frank has been known to associate with, Kufre Effiong appears to be from a different world. He is significantly older than Frank and as his location details show, he lives in the swanky part of town. Who is this guy?\n\nTheir conversation lasts for just 31 seconds and presumably ends with Kufre hanging up. Frank\u2019s phone rings almost immediately at 4.34PM. The caller is +234803*****19 and this conversation lasts decidedly longer than the last one \u2013 almost 4 minutes. Who is the owner of this number that has so much to talk about with someone who is probably Nigeria\u2019s most wanted man at the moment? Truecaller answers once again.\n\nKufre Effiong is an older, wealthier looking man who apparently spends his time in the upscale Ewet Estate while Frank Akpan rapes and murders young women in uncompleted buildings somewhere across town.\n\nWhat could these two possibly have in common that brings them together? Interestingly, if you compare the location data from both calls, it is clear that both men have in fact met physically at a certain 58G, Ewet Housing Estate in Uyo. Frank is probably outside the building talking to this older, wiser man on the phone and hoping to get some help from him.\n\nMore on 58G, Ewet Housing Estate later.\n\nWho exactly is Kufre Effiong? I eventually found the answer after scrolling through dozens, maybe hundreds of social media profiles with that exact name. Mr Effiong as it turns out, is something of a big fish in Niger Delta civil service circles.\n\nNow back to the address where both men met. Plot 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is home to the Uyo branch office of a medical NGO called the Center for Clinical Care and Research (CCCR Nigeria).\n\nFounded in 2010 by an all-star list of accomplished Nigerian-American doctors, CCCR carries out medical outreach programs in underserved areas of Nigeria and promotes medical best practices using a fusion of global best practices and local healthcare delivery models. Or at least it used to, because as far as it is possible to tell, its social media pages have had no activity whatsoever since 2017. A scan of news stories since 2017 using the keywords \u201cCCCR Nigeria\u201d and \u201cCenter for Clinical Care and Research Nigeria\u201d turns up nothing.\n\nAnd yet, at least if Google is to be believed, its Uyo branch office at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate still opens at 8.30AM everyday and closes at 5PM. This exact address also happens to be where Kufre Effiong made and received calls from Frank Akpan, who also physically met him there 24 hours after raping and murdering Hiny Umoren.\n\nBlack market value of human organs | Source: Gizmodo\n\nDue to the convoluted house numbering system in Uyo, the property labeled as 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is also recognised on most digital maps as Plot S.9, Unit G, Ewet Housing Estate. That address is also home to Davok Suites, which is a popular upmarket hotel in Uyo favoured by high profile guests including the Cameroon national team.\n\nThis would be the ideal location for a trusted associate of a politician \u2013 say, a senior civil servant \u2013 to lay his head while running a clandestine errand for his boss.\n\nAn errand such as sourcing human parts for use in a ritual sacrifice ahead of the upcoming election season, for example. Whatever it is that happened or is happening at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate \u2013 and for whose benefit \u2013 is a question only Kufre Effiong can answer. Cavernous as this story has become, there is still one more twist.\n\nHiny Umoren\u2019s Murder \u2013 A Police Cover Up In Progress\n\nAt the outset, I referenced a press release from the Akwa Ibom State Command on May 2 patting themselves on the back for arresting Frank Akpan and solving a huge criminal conspiracy in 5 minutes by pinning everything on him. One of the names singled out for praise in the press release for his alleged role in apprehending Frank Akpan was a certain SP Samuel Ezeugo.\n\nOn April 30, at 4.40PM, Frank Akpan placed a call to someone with the number +2348034386086.\n\nSecond from bottom\n\nAt this point, I trust it will not shock you to know that when I ran this number through Truecaller, the name that came up was none other than\u2026\n\nThe one and the same.\n\nIn other words, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command is releasing statements claiming to be solving a crime by arresting a suspect, the suspect was actually making telephone calls to one of the police officers who would later \u201carrest\u201d him, and speaking to him for a minute and a half. What were they talking about? Perhaps Frank Akpan \u2013 who was still at large at the time \u2013 was giving SP Ezeugo instructions for how to apprehend him nicely?\n\nEven more conveniently, Akpan placed the call to SP Ezeugo less than a minute after receiving a text message from Kufre Effiong. While still physically located at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate.\n\nIn other words, the senior civil servant working at the Niger Delta Ministry probably sent SP Ezeugo\u2019s phone number to Akpan via SMS, with instructions to call him and let him \u201chandle\u201d it.\n\nAnd most tellingly of all, SP Ezeugo\u2019s cell tower location data indicates that while all this was happening, he was in close range of a cell tower near the entrance of Ewet Housing Estate. Presumably, on his way to meet oga.\n\nTake note of the cell tower\u2019s location next to General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nFor comparison, look at Ewet Housing Estate vis-a-vis General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nSo putting the entire picture together, we have what appears to be a well-connected criminal gang in Akwa Ibom with links to the police and the Federal Ministry of the Niger Delta, which probably specialises in sourcing human organs either for the purpose of selling to the international black market or to service local politicians who believe in ritual human sacrifice.\n\nBy the accident of targeting someone with significant social media capital, the existence of this organisation is threatened, and so the Akwa Ibom Police Command is allegedly being used to actively bungle and mishandle the case.\n\nFinding the individual who owns the telephone number +2348*******22 is central to unraveling the mystery of why Iniobong Umoren had to die, how many more like her have died in the past, and most importantly, who are the big fish behind the entire operation. Exactly what is going on at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is another key question that must be answered.\n\nIf Frank Akpan won\u2019t talk, maybe Kufre Effiong can tell us.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated in view of fresh facts.",

Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "title": "Isa Ali Pantami \u2013 The Inside Story of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications & Digital Economy",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nAggrieved parents of the remaining 20 abducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna State have appealed to the Federal Government to urgently assist them in rescuing their children in the captivity of bandits.\n\nThe parents who met on Friday for a prayer session in Kaduna decried the continued stay of their children in the custody of the bandits since they were abducted from the school on April 20.\n\nChairman of the aggrieved parents, Marcus Zarmai, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to use his office to secure the release of the students before something sinister happens to them.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnappers are demanding the sum of N100 million even after the parents have collectively paid them over N60 million ransom for the release of their children without any success.\n\nThe expression on the faces of the parents clearly showed the trauma and nightmare they have gone through in the last three weeks.\n\nHaving exhausted all the money they have to pay as ransom, the parents appealed to the Federal Government to assist them to pay the ransom demanded or find any other way to ensure the safe return of their children.\n\nAmong those kidnapped by the bandits is a woman whose daughter, Esther Chukwuemeka, joined in praying for the release of the abducted persons.\n\nEsther decried that her mother\u2019s absence has created a vacuum in their family and appealed to the bandits to release her mother.\n\nThe mass abduction of students for ransom payment has been on the increase in Kaduna State in recent times, with the government insisting that it would neither negotiate nor pay any money to bandits.\n\nLess than four weeks ago, bandits stormed the school in Chikun Local Government Area of the state where they abducted a total of 20 students and three members of staff of the university.\n\nFew days after the incident, the armed men killed five of the students and threatened to kill the others if their parents and government fail to pay N800 million ransom.\n\nWhile one of the students was later freed about two weeks ago after his parents reportedly paid a ransom for his release, the fate of the remaining students still hangs in the balance.",

Should I send them away? Rather, let me devise a way of integrating them by ensuring that the conflict between farmers and herders does not exist.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that farmer-herder crisis has been solved in Kogi State \u201cwith the cooperation of my traditional rulers, the youths, farmers and even the Fulanis themselves.\n\n\u201cWe know that the land is not enough but we can accommodate each other within the limit of what we have.

There is a need to give everyone the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe examination body, which is responsible for the conduct of the entrance examination into the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions, had directed candidates to provide two pictures in the exam script \u2013 that of who register for the exam and of persons who register for the National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nThe NIN, which is a unique number that identifies individuals, is issued by the country\u2019s National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) upon enrolment.\n\nThe JAMB registrar apologised for the new initiatives introduced in the 2021 UTME, noting that it was not to punish candidates but to expose candidates who engage in the habit of indulging in various forms of malpractices.\n\nWhile calling on the candidates to take note of the process, Professor Oloyede clarified that the essence was to dictate any disparity in the process.\n\n\u201cWe apologise for putting you through some hardship in the registration. The government directed that anyone participating in JAMB must have their NIN. This is beyond our control. Those who are yet to register should do so.\n\n\u201cThe MOCK exam is bill to come up on Thursday. It is an exam meant to test out capability. As you all know, the main exam is coming up on June 5 and 19, 2021,\u201d he told the meeting.\n\nThe JAMB boss added, \u201cWe are meeting with stakeholders today to discuss the issues and on whether we will shift the exam date forward or not. We will brief the media on the outcome of the meeting tomorrow.\n\n\u201cShifting the exam date is not the solution; at the meeting, we will discuss how some of the problems encountered by candidates would be resolved.
