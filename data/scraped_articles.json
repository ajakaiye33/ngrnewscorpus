          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nSays she\u2019s forfeited 80 property valued at $80m to FG\n\nBy Soni Daniel\n\nABUJA \u2014 New chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, said yesterday that the commission has recovered a whopping $153 million from former Petroleum Minister, Diezani Alison Madueke, who has been staying in Britain since leaving office in 2015.\n\nBeyond the amount recovered from the former oil minister, no fewer than 80 choice property valued at $80 million have also been seized from her and handed over to the federal government.\n\nBawa, who who disclosed this, also served a notice that he was ready to relinquish his position if anyone brought pressure on him to do what was not legal in the discharge of his duties. But he was quick to add that bringing the former minister to justice was still far from reality, given the fact that she was out of Nigeria\u2019s jurisdiction and the challenges associated with bringing her home to face justice.\n\nThe chairman said: \u201cThere are several cases surrounding Diezani\u2019s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 property in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that.\n\n\u201cThe other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery, is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country, and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut responding to a question as to how he would be dealing with powerful government officials in the discharge of his assignment as EFCC chair, Bawa said he would be ready to leave the job if anyone tried to make him to do what was illegal.\n\n\u201cI am not going to pay allegiance to individuals in the government,\u201d he said.\n\nBawa pointed out that though he was young in age; he had paid the price on the job, having been among the pioneer staff of EFCC and passed through the crucible to reach the top. \u201cI rose through the ranks. The only job I know after graduation is the EFCC, which I joined in 2004. I rose through the ranks from an ordinary team member, to the first EFCC team leader from the regular staff of the EFCC.\n\n\u201c I became a sectional head, became the zonal head in Ibadan, zonal head in Port Harcourt, and zonal head in Lagos. Lagos is the biggest operational hub of the EFCC with over 600 personnel. Port Harcourt is next to it in terms of complexity and staff strength. I happen to be the first EFCC regular staff to head three different zones before my appointment as the chairman.\n\n\u201cThe records are there. And it is a challenge I have taken upon myself to do without fear or favour. That is the truth. If anybody is coming to ask me to do something that is contrary to my conscience or what the EFCC is set out to achieve, I\u2019m going to resign,\u201d Bawa vowed.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Some funds use Mark-to-Market Accounting, meaning they report the market price of the bonds which they hold.\n\nThis can mean that Unit Prices (UP) are volatile when interest rates change and bond prices rise and fall. This happened in 2020 and is happening in 2021. Other funds use Amortised Cost Accounting, which smoothes out the price performance of a fund. Some use a mixture.\n\n\u201cA third issue is the Guarantee. Some funds guarantee their investors a return (they even have it in their name). This means that they may seek to avoid Mark-to-Market Accounting because Mark-to-Market Accounting introduces volatility in Unit Prices (UP) and volatility looks like risk. The fact is, however, is that market a risk exists anyway, no matter how you account for it.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerian funds want to play in the international league, they need to adopt Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). Very few Nigerian fund managers apply GIPS at the moment. And Mark-to-Market Accounting is one of the cornerstones of GIPS.\n\n\u201cGIPS open the way to the future.\n\nMorningstar and the Financial Times Managed Funds Service. Global investors have access to data on thousands of fund across the world and, thanks to adoption of GIPS, the data is comparable. And it is free. Anyone can use the Morningstar and Financial Times websites to compare thousands of funds.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

This comes after a 3.5% y-o-y contraction estimated for the global economy in 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, global economic growth for 2021 remains clouded by uncertainties including, but not limited to, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the speed of the global vaccine rollout.\n\n\u201cIn addition, sovereign debt levels in many regions, inflationary pressures and central bank responses are key factors to monitor. After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, US economic growth in 2021 is now expected to reach 6.2%. \u201cThe economic growth forecast for the Euro-zone in 2021 is lowered to stand at 4.2%, following a contraction of 6.8% last year.

          "text": "The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has come under severe criticism for saying the Federal Government and its security agents have the capacity to crush insurgents, bandits, criminals and enemies of the country.\n\nThe Minister at a press conference in Lagos on Tuesday, also debunked the belief that the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration is overwhelmed by the current high level of insecurity in the country, adding that in both personnel and equipment, the government has what it takes to tackle insecurity.\n\nHe said at the press conference: \u201cIt is no longer news that our dear nation is facing security challenges. However, I have read comments saying the Federal Government is overwhelmed and doesn\u2019t have a clue as to how to tackle the challenges. Some have even gone as far as suggesting a truncation of the democratic order, a clearly treasonable stance.\n\n\u201cWell, I am here today to assure all Nigerians that while the government acknowledges the security challenges we face at this time, from terrorism to kidnapping, banditry and farmer-herder conflict, it is definitely not overwhelmed and indeed it has the wherewithal, as you will see in the days ahead, to confront the challenges headlong and restore law and order, peace and security.\n\n\u201cOne of the most difficult things to do, for a democratically-elected government, is to use the instruments of coercion against its own people. For example, while the nation\u2019s military have superior firepower over the rag tag band of Boko Haram and ISWAP, the terrorists most often than not operate among the populace, either in our villages or towns, hence the military, in tackling them, is usually careful to avoid collateral damage. The same applies to the kidnappers who abduct our school children.\n\n\u201cUsually, the location of the kidnappers is not unknown to the security forces, but they still have to exercise caution in order not to hurt the same children they are trying to rescue. Despite these inhibitions, the security forces have the wherewithal to decisively tackle the challenges.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the government retains total confidence in the ability of our security forces to tackle the security challenges we are facing now, whether it is terrorism, banditry, kidnapping or even the farmer-herder conflict.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to all Nigerians to continue to support our security agencies, who today face the added task of having to watch their backs while working to protect us. The least we can do is to give them our unalloyed support.\u201d\n\nMohammed, who also described attacks on security agencies in the South-East and the South-South geopolitical zones of the country as a declaration of war against the country, has, however, come under fire for his comments at the press conference, especially from Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhile some outrightly dismissed the minister\u2019s words as another of his usual way of diverting attention from the real issues at stake, others outrightly wrote him off. Some other Nigerians on social media, however, charged the Nigerian government to demonstrate the capacity Mohammed claimed it has, to truly and without delay, crush the bandits.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Nigerians have lately been on the edge, with fear pervading the country, with no where spared of it\u2019s own issues bordering on insecurity.\n\nWhile the North-East is battling with insurgency, North-West and North Central with banditry and farmers/herders crisis, South-West with kidnapping and herders attacks and South-South/South-East contending with the now phenomenal Uknown Gunmen (UGM), kidnapping and the legendary herders/farmers crisis.\n\nTypically, citizens have waited for an appropriate response from government both in soothing words and concrete actions against the criminal elements making life a living hell for them, with a short fuse for anything coming from government that do not appear to measure up to what they expected. The information minister, no doubt incurred their wrath and they made no pretence in expressing their feelings, many which tended towards personal attacks.\n\nA Twitter user, @larrymulo agreed with Mohammed that the Federal Government has the capacity to crush the bandits but is not willing to do so, implying a collusion. He wrote: \u201cSure, I agree with you that the FG has the capability to crush the bandits. What the FG does not have is the willingness to do so, because a master does not crush those that are working for him.\u201d\n\nFor @omeokachie2, the problem with government is that it does not know how to use the capacity it has. He said: \u201cWe have the capacity, we don\u2019t just know how to deploy it. One moment Buhari is waving fingers and threatening terrorists with \u201cI can crush you o\u201d, and the next he is \u201cappealing\u201d to them to stop the attacks. These people have redefined incompetence.\u201d\n\n@samlovaboy, in his comments, slammed Mohammed for lying to Nigerians. He wrote: \u201cSoldiers dey bush dey defend against Boko Haram while Boko Haram dey house dey share sallah package and Palliatives. While our Minister of Lies sit down comfortably inside his office lying as usual\u2026.this country na cruise\u201d, while @abdulkadirrrr said: Yes, you have the capacity on twitter and press statements but they are you and you are them. So how can family members crush each other? I don\u2019t even wish my enemy to experience Buhari!\u201d\n\n@princefaith85 wondered why government has not gone after the criminals if there is actually the capacity to do so. He said: If u have the capacity why not go after them? This is laughable; insulting to the Nigerian Army, the pride of the Nation. Something is wrong somewhere, there are some disgruntled elements furstrateing the security system and making it ineffective to perform. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\n@Joejossy wrote: \u201cCapacity to \u201cstand with\u201d Pantami abi? Or capacity to not have knowledge of \u201cfoolish attempts\u201d to invade Aso Rock to perhaps STEAL our hardworking president? Maybe you mean the obvious capacity to \u201cforgive\u201d terrorists sha\u201d, while @udoetukN asked: \u201cYou have the \u201ccapacity\u201d then why do you allow insecurity to fester on? Or Do you just acquire the \u201ccapacity?\u201d\n\n@Babashola8, in his own contribution, admonished the information minister to refrain from speaking if he does not have some concrete to tell Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSir, if you have no good information to pass to Nigerians, perhaps you should abstain from making comments that would make young people curse you and your generation. Nigerians know what\u2019s going on, even if you offer alternative facts to cover the truth, they know the truth sir\u201d, while @bedebartolome1 asked: \u201cDoes these pops have a conscience at all\u2026 It is a shame to be shameless. Our security forces have said they are outstretched and the rest of us are praying for them only for this man to come and yap off about their capacity to fight.\n\nWhile @Thony_mart asked to know where the capacity of the government is, wondering if Nigerians will have to wait until they are dead, @FREDRICKELLIO13 wrote: \u201cLai has started to talk again! Herdsmen & Bandits + thugs are running round everywhere in the country & Minister is talking capacity. What capacity is he exactly talking about?? OGA pls speak English.\u201d\n\n@ProfAkhidime however called on government to back its words with action, saying \u201cIt is one of the laudable attribute of good leadership to build hope in the led in trying times, but such hope building mechanism must go beyond words to serve the desired purpose. Let words be backed by actions\u201d, while @bashirmamman said: \u201cThe attribute of the good leadership is to build hope in the led, not to destroy. For me, they should demonstrate this capacity so that sanity and peace reigns everywhere in this country.\u201d\n\n@Ifeanyi_umazi was more direct than some others when he wrote: \u201cThis further portrays your wickedness, devilish and insensitivity of the common man\u2019s plight cos. Why wait when you have the \u201ccapacity\u201d when people keep dying in their thousands and huge sums that could alleviate poverty paid as ransome\u201d, while @otonspiff said: \u201cYou know!!! So what you waiting for? You are enjoying the killings? The other time you said government was soon going to publish the names of sponsors of terrorism in the country. Oga you know everything needed to round them up yet you there wasting time. Na wa o.\u201d\n\nFor @ufonu, it was time government demonstrate the capacity it has. \u201cThey should demonstrate this capacity so that sanity and peace reigns everywhere in this country. It\u2019s been so so bandit attacks here and there, UGM attacking police station and killing officers and kidnapping. Please crush the bandits n terrorist with this capacity make we rest\u201d, while @franklinbayo sees drama in the entire insecurity in the country. He wrote: Buhari was appealing to them here while Lai is telling us they have what it takes to crush them. Just read where one said bandits are tired and want peace. These and many more drama\u201d\n\n@Oracle_GF did not spare the minister, as he wrote: \u201cThis man must be under a spell to lie. Whoever he must have offended should forgive him else; he will even lie to the devil in hell. Which FG has the capacity to crush bandits? With what? How? This @OfficialAPCNg member like took an oath to lie without ceasing\u201d, while @rosewater57 wrote: \u201cThe FG cannot be overwhelmed by a situation it is actively supporting and participating in. FG just loves to see the citizens kidnapped & murdered in their homes.\u201d\n\n@rotimilawuyi said: \u201cThis is somehow. FG has capacity to crush bandits and terrorists? So what is it waiting for? How many people have to die or be kidnapped before this capacity is released? Why do govt officials make statements like this? They don\u2019t understand English?\u201d, while @NjoroMichael ssid: \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m inclined to believe the FG is straining to convince itself, and not even citizens. The language \u2013 and subsequent inaction, too \u2013 they\u2019ve been using recently give them away. Scary, what this actually portends for the nation\u201d\n\n@BashirAhmaad believes Mohammed has only come to divert attention from the real issues and he said: \u201cYou see how the Master dishes his own? Now, we\u2019ll focus on his droppings than the actual event. Whatever comes out of Boss Lai Mohammed sends everyone to another dimension; \u201cTruth or False\u201d, while @Ezbaronkings counselled Nigerians to stop taking the minister seriously. \u201cYou guys should stop taking this man seriously. There is absolutely nothing this govt does bad that he will acknowledge let alone criticise. That\u2019s his 9 to 5. That\u2019s the way the work is.\u201d",

          "text": "The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has come under severe criticism for saying the Federal Government and its security agents have the capacity to crush insurgents, bandits, criminals and enemies of the country.\n\nThe Minister at a press conference in Lagos on Tuesday, also debunked the belief that the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration is overwhelmed by the current high level of insecurity in the country, adding that in both personnel and equipment, the government has what it takes to tackle insecurity.\n\nHe said at the press conference: \u201cIt is no longer news that our dear nation is facing security challenges. However, I have read comments saying the Federal Government is overwhelmed and doesn\u2019t have a clue as to how to tackle the challenges. Some have even gone as far as suggesting a truncation of the democratic order, a clearly treasonable stance.\n\n\u201cWell, I am here today to assure all Nigerians that while the government acknowledges the security challenges we face at this time, from terrorism to kidnapping, banditry and farmer-herder conflict, it is definitely not overwhelmed and indeed it has the wherewithal, as you will see in the days ahead, to confront the challenges headlong and restore law and order, peace and security.\n\n\u201cOne of the most difficult things to do, for a democratically-elected government, is to use the instruments of coercion against its own people. For example, while the nation\u2019s military have superior firepower over the rag tag band of Boko Haram and ISWAP, the terrorists most often than not operate among the populace, either in our villages or towns, hence the military, in tackling them, is usually careful to avoid collateral damage. The same applies to the kidnappers who abduct our school children.\n\n\u201cUsually, the location of the kidnappers is not unknown to the security forces, but they still have to exercise caution in order not to hurt the same children they are trying to rescue. Despite these inhibitions, the security forces have the wherewithal to decisively tackle the challenges.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the government retains total confidence in the ability of our security forces to tackle the security challenges we are facing now, whether it is terrorism, banditry, kidnapping or even the farmer-herder conflict.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, appeal to all Nigerians to continue to support our security agencies, who today face the added task of having to watch their backs while working to protect us. The least we can do is to give them our unalloyed support.\u201d\n\nMohammed, who also described attacks on security agencies in the South-East and the South-South geopolitical zones of the country as a declaration of war against the country, has, however, come under fire for his comments at the press conference, especially from Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhile some outrightly dismissed the minister\u2019s words as another of his usual way of diverting attention from the real issues at stake, others outrightly wrote him off. Some other Nigerians on social media, however, charged the Nigerian government to demonstrate the capacity Mohammed claimed it has, to truly and without delay, crush the bandits.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Nigerians have lately been on the edge, with fear pervading the country, with no where spared of it\u2019s own issues bordering on insecurity.\n\nWhile the North-East is battling with insurgency, North-West and North Central with banditry and farmers/herders crisis, South-West with kidnapping and herders attacks and South-South/South-East contending with the now phenomenal Uknown Gunmen (UGM), kidnapping and the legendary herders/farmers crisis.\n\nTypically, citizens have waited for an appropriate response from government both in soothing words and concrete actions against the criminal elements making life a living hell for them, with a short fuse for anything coming from government that do not appear to measure up to what they expected. The information minister, no doubt incurred their wrath and they made no pretence in expressing their feelings, many which tended towards personal attacks.\n\nA Twitter user, @larrymulo agreed with Mohammed that the Federal Government has the capacity to crush the bandits but is not willing to do so, implying a collusion. He wrote: \u201cSure, I agree with you that the FG has the capability to crush the bandits. What the FG does not have is the willingness to do so, because a master does not crush those that are working for him.\u201d\n\nFor @omeokachie2, the problem with government is that it does not know how to use the capacity it has. He said: \u201cWe have the capacity, we don\u2019t just know how to deploy it. One moment Buhari is waving fingers and threatening terrorists with \u201cI can crush you o\u201d, and the next he is \u201cappealing\u201d to them to stop the attacks. These people have redefined incompetence.\u201d\n\n@samlovaboy, in his comments, slammed Mohammed for lying to Nigerians. He wrote: \u201cSoldiers dey bush dey defend against Boko Haram while Boko Haram dey house dey share sallah package and Palliatives. While our Minister of Lies sit down comfortably inside his office lying as usual\u2026.this country na cruise\u201d, while @abdulkadirrrr said: Yes, you have the capacity on twitter and press statements but they are you and you are them. So how can family members crush each other? I don\u2019t even wish my enemy to experience Buhari!\u201d\n\n@princefaith85 wondered why government has not gone after the criminals if there is actually the capacity to do so. He said: If u have the capacity why not go after them? This is laughable; insulting to the Nigerian Army, the pride of the Nation. Something is wrong somewhere, there are some disgruntled elements furstrateing the security system and making it ineffective to perform. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\n@Joejossy wrote: \u201cCapacity to \u201cstand with\u201d Pantami abi?

Or Do you just acquire the \u201ccapacity?\u201d\n\n@Babashola8, in his own contribution, admonished the information minister to refrain from speaking if he does not have some concrete to tell Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSir, if you have no good information to pass to Nigerians, perhaps you should abstain from making comments that would make young people curse you and your generation. Nigerians know what\u2019s going on, even if you offer alternative facts to cover the truth, they know the truth sir\u201d, while @bedebartolome1 asked: \u201cDoes these pops have a conscience at all\u2026 It is a shame to be shameless. Our security forces have said they are outstretched and the rest of us are praying for them only for this man to come and yap off about their capacity to fight.\n\nWhile @Thony_mart asked to know where the capacity of the government is, wondering if Nigerians will have to wait until they are dead, @FREDRICKELLIO13 wrote: \u201cLai has started to talk again! Herdsmen & Bandits + thugs are running round everywhere in the country & Minister is talking capacity. What capacity is he exactly talking about?? OGA pls speak English.\u201d\n\n@ProfAkhidime however called on government to back its words with action, saying \u201cIt is one of the laudable attribute of good leadership to build hope in the led in trying times, but such hope building mechanism must go beyond words to serve the desired purpose. Let words be backed by actions\u201d, while @bashirmamman said: \u201cThe attribute of the good leadership is to build hope in the led, not to destroy. For me, they should demonstrate this capacity so that sanity and peace reigns everywhere in this country.\u201d\n\n@Ifeanyi_umazi was more direct than some others when he wrote: \u201cThis further portrays your wickedness, devilish and insensitivity of the common man\u2019s plight cos. Why wait when you have the \u201ccapacity\u201d when people keep dying in their thousands and huge sums that could alleviate poverty paid as ransome\u201d, while @otonspiff said: \u201cYou know!!! So what you waiting for? You are enjoying the killings? The other time you said government was soon going to publish the names of sponsors of terrorism in the country. Oga you know everything needed to round them up yet you there wasting time. Na wa o.\u201d\n\nFor @ufonu, it was time government demonstrate the capacity it has. \u201cThey should demonstrate this capacity so that sanity and peace reigns everywhere in this country. It\u2019s been so so bandit attacks here and there, UGM attacking police station and killing officers and kidnapping. Please crush the bandits n terrorist with this capacity make we rest\u201d, while @franklinbayo sees drama in the entire insecurity in the country. He wrote: Buhari was appealing to them here while Lai is telling us they have what it takes to crush them. Just read where one said bandits are tired and want peace. These and many more drama\u201d\n\n@Oracle_GF did not spare the minister, as he wrote: \u201cThis man must be under a spell to lie. Whoever he must have offended should forgive him else; he will even lie to the devil in hell. Which FG has the capacity to crush bandits? With what? How? This @OfficialAPCNg member like took an oath to lie without ceasing\u201d, while @rosewater57 wrote: \u201cThe FG cannot be overwhelmed by a situation it is actively supporting and participating in. FG just loves to see the citizens kidnapped & murdered in their homes.\u201d\n\n@rotimilawuyi said: \u201cThis is somehow. FG has capacity to crush bandits and terrorists? So what is it waiting for? How many people have to die or be kidnapped before this capacity is released? Why do govt officials make statements like this? They don\u2019t understand English?\u201d, while @NjoroMichael ssid: \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m inclined to believe the FG is straining to convince itself, and not even citizens. The language \u2013 and subsequent inaction, too \u2013 they\u2019ve been using recently give them away. Scary, what this actually portends for the nation\u201d\n\n@BashirAhmaad believes Mohammed has only come to divert attention from the real issues and he said: \u201cYou see how the Master dishes his own? Now, we\u2019ll focus on his droppings than the actual event.

          "text": "Bose Ogulu, manager and mum to Burna Boy, says she started managing him as a form of sacrifice and not ambition.\n\nThe businesswoman spoke of her dealings with the Grammy-winning Afrofusion star in a chat with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, TV host.\n\n\u201cBurna Boy started in 2010 from Port Harcourt. Even before he took the name, he asked me to manage him. So, I\u2019ve always managed him. It just wasn\u2019t a full-time thing because I was raising kids and had bills to pay,\u201d Ogulu said.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t pay me so I had to do my work. I signed the first deal on his behalf; handled most of his bookings. I\u2019ve always been there but I hadn\u2019t been involved in the day-to-day [tasks]. He was with the label; they had a road manager.\n\n\u201cAnd he seemed on top of things. So I was just managing him and protecting his interest. I think I went full-time in 2017 because it just became evident that the day-to-day and other things I wasn\u2019t handling were not going as well.\n\n\u201cAnd I had more time, fewer kids going to school that I had to pay bills for. And his business could evidently grow to pay me. It was a question of, \u2018this guy is honestly the most talented person I\u2019ve met in the last decade or more.'\u201d\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that Ogulu managed Burna\u2019s music career until 2014 and then became his manager again from 2017 onwards, gaining the nickname Mama Burna. She has collected awards for Burna Boy at various events.\n\nOn why she didn\u2019t manage the singer full-time on the outset, Ogulu said she had kids to raise, a responsibility that came with bills. According to her, Burna Boy\u2019s earnings only grew into something that could pay her much later.\n\n\u201cI just thought, \u2018I can\u2019t help you with talent, but I can help with everything else.\u2019 Fortunately, that scene is not new to me. I\u2019ve done business for most of my life. I\u2019ve been touring for language immersion most of my life,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot I could bring to the table. I thought, \u2018if you work hard at this, it will pay you and your son gets to grow to his highest potential.\u2019 It\u2019s a win-win. Managers don\u2019t get salary but commission on what the artiste makes.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor me, I came to manage him as a form of sacrifice, not ambition. And it\u2019s gratifying to know that it\u2019s become work that I love and can come up to become a legacy. What\u2019s next for me? I look to keep doing what I\u2019m doing.\n\n\u201cAnd hopefully grow more talents. My real focus is on catalogues belonging to us being [the] Spaceship [label].\u201d\n\nOgulu is a daughter of the music critic Benson Idonije, who was the manager of Fela Kuti, the late Afrobeat legend.\n\nWith a Bachelor of Arts in foreign languages and a Masters of Arts in translation from the University of Port Harcourt, she had a successful career as a translator for the Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce.\n\nShe is the founder of Spaceship Collective, the holding company to Spaceship Records and Spaceship Publishing.\n\nCableNG",

We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for good as individuals, as families and as a denomination.\u201d\n\nAdeboye described his late son, Dare, as a \u201cchampion\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cCry if you wish but don\u2019t cry for Pastor Dee (as Dare is fondly called) because he is resting in glory. Cry because you are the one still fighting the battle.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has caught a glimpse of heaven will not be crying for Pastor Dee because there is no comparison between heaven and earth. But then fight courageously because, on the resurrection morning, we shall meet again.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that God who knows the end from the beginning knew long before the foundations of the world that what has happened was going to happen.\n\n\u201cAnd because his word is forever settled, he said all things work together for good to them that love God. We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for our good.\n\n\u201cIn one of his sermons, Dare himself said God does not need a visa to pay you a visit or to do whatever he wants to do in your life.\n\n\u201cAnd I have told you before death is not a function of age. Young people die, old people die, children die. And it is not about how long you live it is how well. Even Jesus Christ himself died at the age of 33. John the Baptist never lived to be 34 and yet he was the greatest.\n\n\u201cWe have lost a champion. You would agree with me on that. Let us consider him a seed that we have sown and let\u2019s get ready for a special harvest.\n\n\u201cI want us to join our forces together and produce many champions like Damilare that would go round the whole world and shake the world for the Lord Jesus. That is how we can honour his memory.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe church of God is marching on. It doesn\u2019t matter what the devil is thinking now.\n\n\u201cThe devil was rejoicing the day the Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross but he never knew what was coming. The devil was rejoicing when Job lost all his children but if only he knew what was coming.\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Disquiet in NAMA over secret recruitments",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nThere is a massive air of suspense in the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) over the recent shortlisting of about 35 candidates to be trained and recruited as Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) with insiders alleging that majority of the shortlisted candidates were from northern part of the country and almost 18 allegedly from Katsina State.\n\nDaily Sun exclusively learnt that the recruitment process was not only said to be lopsided but also shrouded in secrecy following management\u2019s inability to advertise the vacanciesin line with the law establishing the Federal Character Commission which mandates that vacancies for positions in the Federal Civil Service be advertised in one Southern and one Northern paper for a period of six weeks.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that this was the first time such recruitment of ATCOs in particular was happening in NAMA. The source further said the workers were told that management was able to get approval from the Federal Character Commission because it was allegedly told that what was being done was \u2018not a recruitment but replacement.\u2019\n\nSections 14.3 and 14.4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) requires that there shall be no \u2018predominance of persons from a few states or ethnic or other sectional groups\u2019 in the Federal Government and its agencies. But sources within the agency alleged that it was the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, that sent in the list of the candidates that were shortlisted and accused him of running a \u2018one man show\u2019 by exerting undue control over the six agencies under his supervision.\n\n\u201cAmong those were shortlisted for training as ATCOs, only one or two were from the South East, about three were from the South West, while 18 were from Katsina where the Minister comes from. The remaining recruits were from the rest of the northern states,\u201d a source told Daily Sun.\n\nBarely two years ago, the aviation minister was accused of being responsible for a similar lopsided recruitment into the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) when the agency needed security officers in all airports especially Lagos, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Abuja.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that at the time, FAAN had concluded interviews in all the airports and wanted to give priority to those who were already working as causal staff in the different states because they were used to the terrain.\n\nBut an insider told Daily Sun that after FAAN had concluded the interviews for the candidates, \u201c the minister\u2019s list suddenly emerged from the blues with majority of candidates on the list from the north and about 400 from Katsina alone.\n\nUnfortunately, those interviewed by FAAN who were expecting their employment letters were jettisoned.\n\nAccording to them, although the minister\u2019s candidates didn\u2019t go through any interview, they were given appointment letters and told to camp. After they were redeployed to different states from Katsina, most of them couldn\u2019t cope. How can you carry a level four officer from Katsina to Port Harcourt, how would they cope financially? Most of them returned to Katsina and they are there doing nothing. They just go to their farms and collect salaries at the end of the month because Katisna doesn\u2019t have a busy airport. FAAN had to continue overusing those who were at the airports where we needed people.\u201d\n\nIn his response, AviationMinistry\u2019s Director of Media and Publicity, James Odaudu, categorically denied the allegations leveled against Sirika, telling Daily Sun that the minister is a stickler for due process and was neither responsible for recruitment into agencies nor ensuring that vacancies in NAMA are published in national dailies.\n\nMeanwhile there have been strong concerns over evaluation process in NAMA as the shortlisted candidates in NAMA was conducted on April 12 at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) and the result of the exercise has already been released. Though it is still being kept under wraps, insiders within the agency allege that the evaluation was faulty and didn\u2019t follow the due process that would ensure that very competent people are selected as ATCOs.\n\nOne of the issues raised is that most of those recruited are far above the age of 27 required for the position of a cadet in the Air Traffic Control Department. A source told Daily Sun that in the employment manual, it was stated there that a cadet should not be more than 27 years.\n\n\u201cIf they employ cadets at 25 and they go to Zaria for training for two years, by the time they are through, they will be around 27 or 28 but instead Human Resources employed people that are over 30 years old and by the time they are through with training, they will be about 35 to 37 years. Those who drew up that policy did it because a cadet is supposed to be a trainee. You don\u2019t get someone who by the time he is through with NCAT, will have been 35 to come and train under someone who is 27 years old. This is a critical department that deals with the safety of people\u2019s lives. You don\u2019t bring in elderly people that would not fit to do the job. That is just one of the many criteria of the evaluation process that was not met,\u201d the source said.\n\nDaily Sun also reliably learned from another senior management staff who is not authorised to speak on such matters, that the Nigerian Air Traffic Control Association (NATCA) and the Human Resource department have been at loggerheads over staff welfare and recruitment. The body wrote a letter to the management of the agency, expressing concern over the secretiveness of the entire recruitment process and was very worried that considering the very sensitive job of an ATCO (Air Traffic Controllers are responsible for directing the safe movement of aircraft arriving and departing from airports), the Association needed to be involved in the evaluation to ensure that the candidates meet all necessary requirements and only the best hands are selected.\n\n\u201cThe questions the HR should be asked are what were the criteria for the evaluation? Were proper aero medicals carried out to ensure that they are mentally and physically fit? Who conducted the evaluation? Was a committee which includes experienced ATCOs set up? Why was NATCA not involved in the process as had been the tradition in the past? Because of the safety implications of air travel and the very sensitive duties of ATCOs, the recruitment should have been made open so that more people can apply and the best shortlisted.\n\nTypically, the pass mark for ATCOs in any examination is 75 percent and even if candidate scores 74 percent, the person would be considered to have failed but they just orchestrated the evaluation process in such a way that will make it easy for most of the shortlisted candidates to scale through.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf has said former President Olusegun Obasanjo, controversial Islamic cleric, Sheik Gumi and himself negotiated the release of the 27 abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kagara, Kaduna State.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on Arise TV yesterday, he said the team ensured the release of the students where the Federal Government failed.\n\nYusuf, a professor of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation said no ransom was paid for the release of the students.\n\n\u201cThe first and only negotiations that Sheik Gumi and Obasanjo got involved in, Obasanjo was emphatic that no ransom will be paid and we succeeded in doing that where the government failed. No money exchanged hands in the negotiations, no shot was fired and no life was lost. We did the negotiations and got to get these students released.\n\n\u201cThis is what our rural folks have been passing through for years now, negotiating to get their folks out, selling whatever they have, thanks to the inefficiency of our government. If anyone\u2019s loved one is taken, he will do whatever it takes to get the person out. That is what we have been going through for years, but it is making the news now because it is getting closer to the cities,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nHe also said the bandits want genuine peace because they are tired and that he has learned from several meetings with the bandits that they are willing to listen to religious leaders. He added that banditry is a social issue and should be treated as such. He also added that although there\u2019s a role for the military in the fight against banditry, it won\u2019t make the problem go away.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is what we find out, in all the five states we went in, they listen to clerics. In Niger State, they gathered in force to a meeting of war commanders, from six states, in the forest. There\u2019s a role for the military in all of these. Without the military, the North West would have been overrun by Boko Haram, the North Central will be overrun by these bandits, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) will overrun the South East, there will be warlords all-over South West.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for the military but if anybody tells you there\u2019s a military solution to this conflict, he\u2019s either dishonest or he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. There\u2019s no military solution to this problem. Banditry is a social problem and not a military one. We are increasingly militarising what is essentially a social problem. We are dropping a million-dollar bomb on people we should be providing water for.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved new security measures specifically for the South East and South South geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThis was even as a decision has been taken not to publicise measures to be deployed to tackle insecurity in the country, henceforth, for a more effective result.\n\nThe Council has agreed that the level of insecurity in the country, especially, in the last one month must be reversed.\n\nThe acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, who, alongside the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (retd) and Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, briefed journalists, yesterday, said president Buhari gave the approval during the security meeting he presided overat the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThey security chiefs were also joined by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who noted that President Buhari presiding over the Security Council three times in two weeks \u201cshows the premium he and his administration has placed on security issues.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have some measures, which we have outlined and have been approvedby the Council and we\u2019ll see how we can change the narrative within the quickest possible means to restore law and order and restore peace in that area.\n\n\u201cWe solicit all law abiding citizens to work with us to identify and deal with the situation. That is that, I may not go into the details of how we will do that.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the meeting stressed the need to address the security challenges in the country, particularly those who had arisen in the last few months.\n\nHe said president gave matching orders to ideal with the emerging problems physically.\n\nThe NSA said: \u201cThe president has given direction on how to make these things effective. Already, the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) has been given certain instructions on how to deal with this, but Council has agreed that the level of insecurity in the country, especially in the last one month, is something that has to be addressed with the immediacy that it requires; and at the operational level, of course, the Chief of Defence Staff has been working with the service chiefs and the recommendations they\u2019ve made to the council are already being handled.\u201d\n\nIrabor, on his part, said: \u201cNo doubt, far-reaching decisions were made. On our part, just as the National Security Adviser indicated, I briefed on various measures that the Armed Forces, in partnership with othersecurity agencies, should take to stem the tide of insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe council was pleased with the actions and, of course, the prayers that were made, which Council has also graciously undertaken to look into. These, of course, have to do with manpower development, training and equipment issues and, thankfully, theglow on my face should, of course, give you an indication as to the graciousness of the National Security Council, in relation to the briefings that we\u2019ve given in this regard, and I believe that going forward, we shall be translating that, and it will have some great impact on the security disposition across the country.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Want appointments to reflect federal character\n\n\u2022Urge Buhari to address nation on insecurity\n\nBy Omon-Julius Onabu\n\nGovernors of the 17 southern states under the aegis of the Southern Governors Forum have called on the federal government to convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency to address widespread agitations among Nigerians for greater inclusiveness in governance.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency,\u201d they said in a communique at the end of their meeting yesterday in Asaba, the Delta State capital.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country and end to open grazing in the Southern parts of the country to curb the excesses of armed herders.\n\nIn the 12-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors stressed the need to review appointments into federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character and the heterogeneity of the Nigerian population.\n\nThey said in the communiqu\u00e9, read by the Chairman of the forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, that they had resolved to foster cooperation among the Southern states and the nation at large.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added that the governors reviewed the situation in the country and deliberated on the current security situation, agitations/restructuring, prospect for inter-state collaboration and partnerships as well as on the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTheir conclusion: \u201cWe affirm that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness, and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nObserving that the incursion of armed herders, criminals, and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security, the governors said open grazing has to stop.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria,\u201d they said, noting that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South.\n\nGiven this scenario, they said, it has become imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South, including cattle movement to the South by foot.\n\nThe governors also recommended that the federal government should support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nThey added that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance the commitment to and practice of true federalism.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is a need to review appointments into the federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogeneous.\u201d\n\nThey expressed concern over the continued gridlock on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway and the chokehold, it exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.\n\nTo ease the gridlock, the governors recommended the activation and establishment of ports in other states of the federation to create new jobs and promote socio-economic activities in the country.\n\nThe governors also expressed concern over the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and suggested greater coordination and cooperation between the federal and state governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\nThey further \u201cexpressed very grave concern on the security challenges currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr. President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people.\n\nBesides Akeredolu, other governors at the meeting were Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State;; Chief Willie Obiano of Anambra State; Senator Duoye Diri of Bayelsa State; Chief Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; Mr. Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; and Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nOthers are: Prince Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State; Mr. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; and Chief Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\nHowever, Prof. Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State were absent, while Mr. Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) and Senator Hope Uzodimma (Imo State) were represented by their deputies.\n\nACF Backs Ban on Open Grazing, Supports Restructuring\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has endorsed the position of the southern governors\u2019 forum on the ban on open grazing of cattle.\n\nSpokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe stated this while reacting to the outcome of the governors\u2019 meeting in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\nHe however said before a decision should be taken on restructuring, Nigerians should first agree on whether the country should remain one before deciding on what structure to adopt.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the ban of open grazing, I don\u2019t think there is much problem here with the stand of the ACF.\n\n\u201cAt our last National Working Committee meeting in Kaduna, the National leader of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria spoke to us at length and he said he and his organisation have decided that the only way forward and that is in the interest of MACBAN, is to embark on ranching and that they were waiting for governments policy on this\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nHe stressed further that, \u201cIf MACABAN wants open grazing banned, not only in the southern part of Nigeria but all over Nigeria, who are we to say otherwise?\n\n\u201cWe are therefore in support of the stand of MACBAN and the Southern state governors.\u201d\n\nHe however said, on the issue of dialogue and restructuring, \u201cthe ACF has always believed in this if the aim of the dialogue is to promote the unity and progress of the whole country.\n\n\u201cOur forum will dialogue with any state and group of people that share our cherished ideals of unity, justice, peace and progress\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nOn restructuring, he said \u201cthe ACF believes that before we make a decision on this, we should agree on whether Nigeria should remain one country before deciding on what structure Nigeria should take.\n\n\u201cOur position on this is informed on the facts that some of the advocates of restructuring are at the same time advocating the dissolution of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAre they believers in Nigeria at all? We must all agree to let Nigeria be before we move forward.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Abacha\u2019s $311m refund intact, says Orji\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), manager of Nigeria\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), yesterday announced its audited results for its 2020 financial year, reflecting a strong financial performance and consistent implementation of strategic infrastructure investment programmes for the year.\n\nThe results showed that despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year under review, the NSIA recorded 343 per cent growth in its total income, which rose to N160.06 billion in 2020, up from the N36.15 billion in the previous year.\n\nAlso, excluding devaluation gain of N51 billion, the NSIA made a core income of N109 billion compared to N33.07 billion in 2019.\n\nIn addition, it achieved 33 per cent growth in net assets to N772.75 billion, compared with the N579.54 billion it achieved in 2019.\n\nNSIA Managing Director, Mr. Uche Orji, said at a virtual media briefing yesterday that the organisation received an additional contribution of $250 million and provided the first stabilisation support to the federal government of $150 million withdrawn from the Stabilisation Fund, in the year under review.\n\nSimilarly, the NSIA received $311 million from funds recovered from late Gen. Sani Abacha from the United States Department of Justice and Island of Jersey for funding of Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) projects such as Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 adversely affected logistics around infrastructure projects, especially the toll road projects, and the presidential fertiliser initiative. In response to COVID-19, NSIA partnered Global Citizen, a not-for-profit group, to form the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund. Separately NSIA acquired and distributed oxygen concentrators to 21 teaching hospitals as part of corporate social responsibility, in addition to staffing support to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19,\u201d Orji said.\n\nGiving a highlight on the activities of Nigeria Infrastructure Fund (NIF), he said projects under construction in the country had reached major milestones across domestic infrastructure projects in motorways, agriculture, and healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, in 2020, there were improved contributions from subsidiaries/affiliates such as Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company (InfraCredit), Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) and Family Homes Funds Ltd (FHFL).\n\nThe NSIA, he said, invested additional capital into NG Clearing, the first derivative clearing house in Nigeria to maintain NSIA\u2019s shareholding at 16.5 per cent following the company\u2019s rights issue of 2020.\n\nOrji said the NSIA in 2020 launched its Nigeria Innovation Fund to address investment opportunities within Nigeria in information technology with an immediate pipeline that included data networking, data centres, software, and services as well as agri-tech and biotech.\n\nIt also made progress on developing the ammonia and diammonium phosphate production plants in partnership with OCP in the review year, as it selected Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom as the venue after an extensive review of several other locations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the year under review, COVID-19 adversely impacted NSIA key infrastructure projects, with significant disruptions to the supply chains and logistics of NSIA\u2019s key projects. NSIA maintained its three-pronged investment approach: direct investments, co-investment with partners, and creation of financial institutions to fill critical institutional voids in the infrastructure landscape. In 2020 the Authority recorded significant progress on all fronts.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the Authority has invested significantly in crucial sub-sectors of the financial landscape with the intention of bridging critical voids that otherwise constrain investments and smooth operations in the sector.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the access roads to the Second Niger Bridge, 2A and 2B, 17.5 kilometres (Km) each (totaling 35km), were added to PIDF scope of work. \u201cThese had initially been part of scope expected to be carried out by the Federal Ministry of Works but owing to several challenges they have been unable to commence the projects leading to a transfer to the NSIA. The original scope of NSIA\u2019s section was 10.7KM of bridge and road, bringing the entire project to more than 45Km.\n\n\u201cAs of year-end 2020, the original scope of 10.7km Second Niger Bridge is at 53 per cent completion with a completion target of 2022. The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is at 66 per cent completion and is expected to be completed in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe initial scope of the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway is at 66 per cent completion. However, please note that the scope of the project has been expanded from the rehabilitation of 92.5km along the three sections of the road to the full reconstruction of the entire stretch of 375km, as directed by Mr. President; this has extended the completion date. The NSIA is exploring options to shorten the completion timeline for the project.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA ran the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) from December 2016 to December 2020, adding that the operator company \u2013 NAIC-NPK \u2013 has now been spun off to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI).\n\n\u201cThe Authority\u2019s role in the programme has shifted upstream. NSIA\u2019s role is limited to importation, storage, and the wholesale of raw materials to blenders. In essence, blenders are expected to build the capacity to actively participate in the sub-sector.\n\n\u201cOver the period it ran, 42 blending plants were enlisted under the programme while a total of 30 million 50kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 fertiliser were made available to the Nigerian farmers. Beyond serving a proof of concept for import substitution in the fertiliser space, the programme led to the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the agriculture value chain including in logistics, ports, bagging, rail, industrial warehousing, and haulage touchpoints amongst others. It also enabled the country to conserve foreign exchange that would have otherwise been used for subsidy payment,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on his outlook for 2021, he said the NSIA would raise fund by issuing a Sukuk bond.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAlthough NSIA believes the market is unlikely to repeat some of the performance of 2020, it is more likely that a broader market recovery will occur with economies opening unlike the case in 2020 in which technology stocks drove market performance.\n\n\u201cIn the Future Generations Fund, we expect to allocate more capital to venture capital, global equity markets, and increasing exposure to European equities where we had been underexposed in 2020. NSIA believes that the broad opening of the markets will provide a comprehensive lift to equities.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the Innovation Fund is expected to be very active as we see opportunities in data centers, data networking, software, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and many others.\n\n\u201cNSIA expects to complete concession, capital raise and operationalisation of the three PIDF road projects: Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway.\n\n\u201cDespite concerns around new waves of COVID-19, the Authority remains confident that with widespread vaccination programmes, global economies will continue to reopen and create more opportunities to create value by the NSIA.\u201d\n\nOrji also shed more light on the NSIA\u2019s financial performance when he appeared yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe explained that some of the NSIA\u2019s portfolios were up by as much as 50 per cent in dollar terms in 2020, predicting that although the financial technology sector ruled the market last year, there will be a broader profit ecosystem this year as countries continue to open up on the back of increasing COVID-19 vaccine jabs.\n\nAccording to him, the body has been aggressive in terms of its focus on international equities, private equity investments, venture capital and direct investments in the international market, where much of the profits came from.\n\nHe said with the exception of just one or two portfolios, every single asset class made substantial returns to the NSIA last year, with net profit of N108.9 billion.\n\nHe predicted a broader recovery for the equity side of the investments this year, saying that although stock market growth in 2020 was largely anchored on technology, activities in 2021 will be driven by aviation and the industrial sectors as the world opens up again.\n\nUche stated that fixed income should be closely watched by investors, except for the impact of inflation, which he predicted would make interest rates go up and make fixed income instruments fall.\n\n\u201cMy view is that on the balance of risk, we are more likely to see interest rates go up than go down,\u201d he added, noting that venture capitalist funds are also being explored by the organisation.\n\n\u201cOn the average, we had almost 30 per cent returns in dollar terms and we are going to be more aggressive in venture capital,\u201d he said.\n\nUche stated that the NSIA is also investing in fintech, software services, data networking as well as biotech and pharmaceuticals.\n\nBesides, the NSIA has also intervened in the diagnostics and radiology centres in Kano and Umuahia and the cancer centres at the Lagos Nigeria University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).\n\nIt is also discussing with the University College, London, to develop pharmaceutical industries in Nigeria.\n\nOn the Abacha loot, he stated: \u201cThe Abacha fund was $311 million that was returned to Nigeria by the US Department of Justice and Island of Jersey and the agreement was to spread the money in equal measures across three projects.\n\n\u201cThese are the Lagos-Ibadan Road, Abuja-Kano Road and the Second Niger Bridge. Each of them will get $103million-$104 million. To spend the money, we have been required to have external auditors aside from our in-house auditors as Deloitte to monitor the disbursement of that fund.\n\n\u201cA civil society group, CLEEN foundation has been appointed by the Ministry of Justice and also with the US government to also supervise the disbursement of the fund. So, you can imagine that every single pair of eyes possible are overlooking how these funds will be disbursed.\n\n\u201cThe fund is still there intact. Not a dime has been spent. It is being held in our accounts with the central bank.\u201d\n\nHe added that another \u20ac4.2 was being expected to be repatriated, which the authorities have agreed should come to the NSIA to be used for the three projects.\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA is planning to invest more in healthcare sector this year, with the ramping up of infrastructure in Abuja and an eye on 20 such centres nationwide.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Also, excluding devaluation gain of N51 billion, the NSIA made a core income of N109 billion compared to N33.07 billion in 2019.\n\u201cCOVID-19 adversely affected logistics around infrastructure projects, especially the toll road projects, and the presidential fertiliser initiative.\nGiving a highlight on the activities of Nigeria Infrastructure Fund (NIF), he said projects under construction in the country had reached major milestones across domestic infrastructure projects in motorways, agriculture, and healthcare.\nHe said: \u201cIn the year under review, COVID-19 adversely impacted NSIA key infrastructure projects, with significant disruptions to the supply chains and logistics of NSIA\u2019s key projects.\n\u201cIn the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the Innovation Fund is expected to be very active as we see opportunities in data centers, data networking, software, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and many others.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nAn indigenous firm, UTM Offshore Limited, has signed a deal with Japan Gas Corporation (JGC), a leading international Engineering Design, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm, to establish a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility, the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\nThis followed the issuance of licence by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to establish the FLNG facility.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited took a major step to actualise the project yesterday, signing virtually, a landmark preliminary front end engineering design (Pre-FEED) agreement with JGC.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the Pre-FEED scope would be completed within four months from commencement date.\n\nUTM has also engaged Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) of the UK to provide owner\u2019s engineering services on the project.\n\nKBR is to provide due diligence on the JGC scope by conducting a third-party review of all deliverables from JGC during the Pre-FEED.\n\nSpeaking at the virtual signing event, the Managing Director of UTM Offshore Limited, Mr. Julius Rone, said JGC Corporation came highly recommended given the several similar projects the firm had undertaken across the world.\n\n\u201cWhat UTM is doing is largely novel. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria and we are very excited about this trail-blazing project: The opportunity to build from the scratch, the first floating liquefied natural gas facility in Nigeria is humongous. That is why we cannot afford to settle for less hence our resolve to contract JGC Corporation, one of the leading firms in the LNG Construction sector in the world, to provide the Pre-Front End Engineering Design Services for this first Floating LNG facility in Nigeria,\u201d Rone said.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited is pioneering the development of the FLNG facility in collaboration with LNG Investment Management Services (LIMS), a subsidiary of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe facility, a newly-built vessel, will receive gas feedstock from an existing offshore facility, treat it to required LNG standard, liquefy the gas, store the LNG and offload to LNG carriers.\n\nAccording to Rone, the floating LNG, when fully completed shall have an LNG production capacity of 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa), Turret and Mooring System, Gas pre-treatment modules, LNG production modules, living quarters, self-contained power generation and utilities as well as capacities for LNG storage and offloading.\n\nAt the landmark agreement signing event, Rone thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for creating an enabling environment for indigenous firms like UTM Offshore to equitably operate in the very sensitive and competitive upstream sector of the petroleum industry.\n\nHe said that the resolve of UTM Offshore to embark on the huge project is steeped in the National Gas Policy of the Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nRone said: \u201cAt UTM Offshore, we completely agree with Mr. President that given Nigeria\u2019s potential of about 600 trillion cubic feet of gas, the commodity has the enormous potential to diversify our country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe also agree that the rising global demand for cleaner energy sources has offered Nigeria an opportunity to exploit gas resources for the good of the country.\n\n\u201cWe thank the president for making gas development and utilization a national priority to stimulate economic growth, further improve Nigeria\u2019s energy mix, drive investments, and provide the much-needed jobs for our citizens in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, for tenaciously driving Mr. President\u2019s vision in the petroleum sector, particularly the gas policy.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to key players in the national petroleum industry, notably the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, and the Director of Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Mr. Sarki Auwalu, for their support for the FLNG project.\n\nAccording to him, other partners and critical stakeholders that are supporting the FLNG project include Afreximbank, NAPIMS, Templars, Vitol, Yahaska Energy Services Limited and the government of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI am particularly thankful to the visionary Governor of Delta State, His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who from Day One, believed in our dream of building the first Floating LNG in Nigeria and has been of immense support since then.\n\n\u201cWe cannot thank him enough. Indeed, we are assuring all our partners and stakeholders that we will not let them down,\u201d Rone said.\n\nAuwalu, who attended the event virtually lauded Rone and his team for blazing the trail in building Nigeria first Floating LNG. He said: \u201cIt is a historic event today as UTM Offshore working with our support is actualizing Mr. President vision not just for gas and the diversification of our economy.\n\n\u201cMr. President has promised to migrate Nigeria to gas and that is what UTM Offshore is doing with the decision to build and operate and FLNG. It is a tortuous process but I can confirm that UTM Offshore has met all the requirements and that is why DPR gave the firm license to proceed with the building of the FLNG.\n\n\u201cAt DPR we have been monitoring closely what UTM is doing and we are very happy that they are working with the best firms and consultants in the world, in fact, first-class and globally renowned firms are working with UTM Offshore to actualize this FLNG. DPR shall continue to guide and encourage UTM on this project.\u201d\n\nAn executive of JGC Corporation of Japan, Mr. Koji Sakrai, praised the vision and tenacity of Rone and his firm, pledging the commitment of his company to deploy the latest and cost-effective engineering design and constructions modules in undertaking the project and assured that the task would be completed within schedule.\n\nPresent at the agreement signing were the representatives of the GMD of NNPC, Mr. Abubakar Umar; representatives of Vitol, Mr. Chibuzor Ifeanyi; while Mr. Steve Brown also of Vitol joined virtually.\n\nAn Executive Director, Afrexim Bank, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna, joined virtually, while Mr. Peter Olowononi and Mrs Ngozi Kalu-Mba, also from the bank attended the event.\n\nSpecial Adviser on Investments to the Delta State Governor, Mr. Paul Nma, represented the governor, while Dr. Yahuza Kassim, who made a detailed presentation on the FLNG project represented Yahuza Energy Services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

One man down, we regroup and advance!\u201d\n\nUrging Nigerians not to cry over the demise of his son, he rather called for prayers for his widow, mother, children, siblings and the entire family.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to thank each and every one of you, for this massive show of love, not just for Dare but for me, my wife, the widow, the children, the siblings\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful, I am only bringing you this brief message not just to thank you but to let you know that by the special grace of God, we are loved of God and because we are loved of God, we are more than conquerors.\n\n\u201cI want you to know that God who knows the end from the beginning, knew long before the foundations of the world that what has happened is going to happen.\n\n\u201cAnd because His word is forever settled, He said all things work together for good to them that love God. We may not understand now, but what has happened is going to work out for good as individuals, as families and as a denomination.\n\n\u201cCry if you wish but don\u2019t cry for Pastor Dee (as Dare is fondly called) because he is resting in glory. Cry because you are the one still fighting the battle.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has caught a glimpse of heaven will not be crying for Pastor Dee because there is no comparison between heaven and earth. But then fight courageously because, on the resurrection morning, we shall meet again.\n\n\u201cIn one of his sermons, Dare himself said God does not need a visa to pay you a visit or to do whatever He wants to do in your life.\n\n\u201cAnd I have told you before, death is not a function of age. Young people die, old people die, children die. And it is not about how long you live, it is how well.\n\n\u201d Even Jesus Christ himself died at the age of 33. John the Baptist never lived to be 34 and yet he was the greatest.\n\n\u201cWe have lost a champion. You would agree with me on that. Let us consider him a seed that we have sown and let\u2019s get ready for a special harvest.\n\n\u201cI want us to join our forces together and produce many champions like Damilare that would go round the whole world and shake the world for the Lord Jesus. That is how we can honour his memory.\n\n\u201cThe church of God is marching on. It doesn\u2019t matter what the devil is thinking now. The devil was rejoicing the day the Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross but he never knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cThe devil was rejoicing when Job lost all his children but if only he knew what was coming.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, tears poured as Pastor Dare was committed to mother earth after the farewell service.\n\nAmong the dignitaries on ground were Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide aka Winners\u2019 Chapel, David Oyedepo; his wife, Faith; Pastor David Oyedepo Jr; and Senior Pastor Covenant Christian Centre, Pastor Poju Oyemade; as well as thousands of worshippers and well wishers who connected physically and virtually.\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A legal opinion was attached.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the suspended MD never obeyed the directive.\n\nIt was learnt that it was the same Bala Usman who conveyed the approval of the President for extension of the lease in a letter dated 13th December, 2018 and exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nStakeholders were therefore taken aback when she turned around and cancelled the same lease after some months. See Also Scandal EXCLUSIVE: How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman Awarded Coastline Terminals To Dangote's Proxy Company In Shady Deal\n\nMany observers raised concerns when the news broke because the LADOL project was considered a success story of indigenous investment and local capacity development within the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cThe site in question was originally a disused swamp before it was leased to the firm led by Chief Oladapo Jadesimi\n\n\u201cFor over 19 years, the swamp has been gradually transformed into a wholly developed terminal and industrial zone now known as LADOL Free Zone, a one-stop shop for multinational and industrial companies operating in West Africa.\n\n\u201cIt was commissioned by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on the 10th of August, 2018 in an event hosted by the Managing Director of NPA. At the event, Bala Usman herself praised the operational efficiency and synergy between NPA and LADOL that culminated in the successful berthing of Egina FPSO. During the same event, the Managing Director of Shell confirmed that his company had already gained 40% cost savings from working with LADOL.\n\n\u201cAmong other benefits, the lease was yielding a minimum of about N419 million per annum on rent alone to the government, including other taxes.\n\n\u201cHowever, after the swampy land was reclaimed and developed LADOL Free zone, the NPA cancelled the lease citing reasons that have not yet been substantiated logically.\n\n\u201cFor instance the claim by NPA under Hadiza\u2019s leadership that the sublease was done without their knowledge in a manner that will short-change the country was later found to be false.\n\n\u201cActually, it was discovered that GRML had applied to NPA via a letter dated November 22, 2013, expressing its intention to sublease 11.246 hectares at the LADOL offshore facility.\n\n\u201cIronically, after the cancellation the NPA\u2019s purported lease to Samsung Heavy Industries Limited was at the same terms as the subsisting lease to LADOL yet it was supposed to yield an income of N230.3 million almost half of what LADOL was paying as rent for the same land area. See Also News How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman, Lambasted Buhari\u2019s Government Over Niger, Zamfara Students' Abductions\n\n\u201cWith the backing of NPA and based on the fictitious and unjustified pretext of investor protection to a foreign company who apparently has not invested a dime in the economy but who has allegedly repatriated over $2 billion in the five years of doing contracts in Nigeria, it was clear that Bala Usman wanted to hand over a strategic asset belonging to the country, especially the legacy of the multi-billion dollar investment made into the Egina field development as a gift to Samsung.\n\n\u201cAs the controversy was raging, Samsung capitalised on the delay orchestrated by NPA and proceeded to court. The consequent disagreement sent mixed signals to many partners who stalled their transactions till the conclusion of the ongoing litigations including arbitration in London.\n\n\u201cThe question stakeholders are asking is the value that NPA will create for the country by cancelling a contract already awarded to an indigenous company and re-awarding it on the same terms and lower returns to a foreign company,\u201d a source at the NPA told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother source in Presidency expressed shock at how a public officer will flout directives from the President and allow herself to become an instrument for economic sabotage.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a prominent maritime stakeholder said Bala Usman's actions have led to destruction of investors\u2019 confidence and huge capital flight\n\n\u201cThe lady took many of such actions and we did not know she was not going through the necessary due process.

See Also News How Suspended NPA Boss, Hadiza Usman, Lambasted Buhari\u2019s Government Over Niger, Zamfara Students' Abductions\n\n\u201cWith the backing of NPA and based on the fictitious and unjustified pretext of investor protection to a foreign company who apparently has not invested a dime in the economy but who has allegedly repatriated over $2 billion in the five years of doing contracts in Nigeria, it was clear that Bala Usman wanted to hand over a strategic asset belonging to the country, especially the legacy of the multi-billion dollar investment made into the Egina field development as a gift to Samsung.\n\n\u201cAs the controversy was raging, Samsung capitalised on the delay orchestrated by NPA and proceeded to court. The consequent disagreement sent mixed signals to many partners who stalled their transactions till the conclusion of the ongoing litigations including arbitration in London.\n\n\u201cThe question stakeholders are asking is the value that NPA will create for the country by cancelling a contract already awarded to an indigenous company and re-awarding it on the same terms and lower returns to a foreign company,\u201d a source at the NPA told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother source in Presidency expressed shock at how a public officer will flout directives from the President and allow herself to become an instrument for economic sabotage.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, a prominent maritime stakeholder said Bala Usman's actions have led to destruction of investors\u2019 confidence and huge capital flight\n\n\u201cThe lady took many of such actions and we did not know she was not going through the necessary due process. We have now learnt that many of the arbitrariness and insubordination that characterised her tenure did not receive the blessing of either the Minister of Transportation or the President. The fear is that such actions have led to so much destruction of investor confidence and huge capital flight,\u201d he told SaharaReporters.\n\nOther stakeholders complained that Usman's approach to issues led to several litigation against the NPA which had frustrated contractual agreements that preceded her appointment, making the government incur avoidable losses amounting to millions of dollars in the last five years.\n\nThe claimed her numerous defiant actions might have contributed to the sudden and sharp drop in the income of the NPA at a time when the economy is in dire need of revenue, which might have angered the President.",

          "title": "Despite $33 million Q1 revenue, Jumia\u2019s share price may take another nosedive after recent results",
          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media.

          "text": "Almost a month after Uber and Bolt drivers under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA) umbrella held a strike in Lagos, Uber has raised its prices. At the time of the strike in April, the President of PEPDA, Idris Shonuga, said one of the reasons the drivers were striking was the pricing of the rides.\n\nHe argued that the fare prices had become so low it was difficult for drivers to make ends meet and likened driving for cab-hailing services to a type of systemic poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a complaint that we\u2019re hearing from ride-hailing drivers worldwide. In March 2021, drivers made landmark progress after winning a lawsuit forcing Uber to classify them as workers instead of independent contractors.\n\nThat distinction is essential because classifying drivers as independent workers allows Uber and Bolt to avoid paying insurance, paid leave, and other benefits.\n\nThe victory of Uber drivers in London has led to a global push for a similar reclassification with drivers in South Africa and Nigeria planning class-action lawsuits against Uber and Bolt. For now, Uber drivers will take the small victory of raised prices.\n\nIn a statement to driver-partners, Uber said, \u201cWe remain committed to providing a reliable earning opportunity for driver-partners, as well as a reliable and affordable service for riders. With this in mind, starting 11th May 2021, we are increasing prices on UberX by about 13%.\u201d\n\nBetween 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Mondays, and 8:00 am till 12:00 pm on Tuesdays through Friday, Uber riders will now pay a base fare of N237, minimum fare of N538; N70 per kilometre and N12 per minute. These fares are up from the previous minimum fare of N500, N200 base fare, N50 per kilometre and N11 per minute.\n\nAt other periods, riders will be charged a minimum fare of N575; a base fare of N255, N75 per kilometre and N12.5 per minute.\n\nThere are reports that the drivers are unimpressed with the changes seeing as one of their demands was that Uber reduce its commission from 25% and give them a say in deciding the fees.\n\nThe President of PEPDA wasn\u2019t available to speak on the phone at the time of this report.",

          "title": "Maviance raises $3m from MFS Africa to digitize financial services across Central Africa",
          "text": "Maviance, a Cameroon-based company providing digital financial services like agency banking and bulk bill payments, has raised $3 million (\u20ac2.5 million) in equity financing.\n\nThe investment is solely from MFS Africa, the cross-border fintech company connecting mobile money providers like MTN to banks like Ecobank across over 34 countries in Africa.\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s investment gives it an undisclosed minority stake in Maviance.\n\nMaviance\u2019s flagship product is Smobilpay, a platform that integrates payments solutions from banks, mobile money operators and telecoms operators. Smobilpay is connected to GIMAC, the interoperability switch of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) \u2013 the central bank of the Central African region.\n\nBecause it is a business-to-business company, Smobilpay may not be familiar with consumers. But the platform serves over 500,000 unique customers a month, according to the company.\n\nJerry Cheambe, Maviance founder, believes the pandemic has helped increase business owners\u2019 appetite for digitising payments. Cameroon is a country of 26.88 million people. Mobile connections increased by 11% to 26.6 million between January 2020 and January 2021 while internet penetration is at 34%.\n\nWith this seed funding, Maviance will expand Smobilpay\u2019s national footprint in Cameroon to serve more consumers and to move into Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Maviance will be building new products but they won\u2019t go to market within the next 12 months.\n\n\u201cOur journey now is to become a regional company, providing cross-border services within the CEMAC region. We want to be a catalyst for interoperability,\u201d Cheambe says.\n\nHe adds that Maviance chose to go with MFS Africa because they bring money, industry knowledge, a product suite and a pan-African network of fintechs and businesses of various sizes to the table. The deal took over a year, from contact to close.\n\nThe appeal for both companies is to collaborate on building digital financial services in the Central African economic region\u2019s 6 countries: Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nMaviance was founded in Germany in 2008 by Jerry Cheambe and Michael Flach. They launched Maviance Cameroon in 2012, at a time when mobile money looked unlikely in the country.\n\n\u201cI remember saying at one point that mobile money will not work in Cameroon because it was just not happening,\u201d Cheambe says to TechCabal.\n\nTen years later, the landscape has improved enough for Maviance to be raising a large seed round.\n\n95% of Maviance Cameroon\u2019s 20-person staff are based in Cameroon. Cheambe is based in Germany where he oversees Maviance Germany, which operates independently of the Cameroonian venture.\n\nAnother strategic move by MFS Africa\n\nMFS Africa has been on a roll of deals over the last 12 months.\n\nIn June 2020, the South Africa-based company acquired Beyonic, a Tanzania-based payments company, in a cash and shares deal that paid out at least 4x returns for Beyonic\u2019s investors. Last month, MFS Africa led a $2.3 million seed round in Numida, a credit provider for small businesses in Uganda.\n\nWith Maviance in the mix, MFS Africa continues a conscious push to be Africa\u2019s largest hub for digital financial services.\n\nAs with the Beyonic deal, the Maviance team was in the process of raising money when MFS Africa approached.\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, says Maviance has been on MFS Africa\u2019s radar for some time. What convinced him to initiate investment conversations with Cheambe?\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of the asset \u2013 what they have built on the ground \u2013 the ability to work with them and the shared vision of the founder,\u201d Okoudjou says to TechCabal.\n\nMFS Africa was already present in Cameroon and the Republic of Congo, working with mobile networks MTN and Airtel. But MFS Africa can rely on Maviance to cover the region and carry out integrations much faster.\n\nThough MFS Africa had scanned the market for other possible partners, the Maviance team had a long-term focus on building solid foundations. It is a minority investment but \u201cobviously both Jerry and I know that there is a possible path forward together,\u201d Okoudjou says.",

The first edition of the event held recently at Radisson Hotel, Ikeja, with the finest set of creative and brilliant software engineers and tech innovators in attendance.\n\nThe young, vibrant and smart-looking techies took turns to chat with the company\u2019s in-house assessors. This was followed by intense conversations and demos, as each of the participants displayed novel approaches to software design and development.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s objective for organizing the event, Executive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters, stressed that Accelerex\u2019s most valuable asset is its human resource. Therefore, it places the highest premium on attracting the best talents across the country.\n\n\u201cAs a Company, we know that there are Nigerian software engineers that can rival their counterparts around the globe, as recent developments in the fintech space have shown. A critical part of our effort to strengthen the digital economy is the creation of this platform where outstanding individuals can showcase their skills and can join the Technology Team at Accelerex. We believe that the next big names in the technology space will come out of Africa, and we are providing the breeding ground for them,\u201d Mr. Peters stated.\n\nExecutive Director, Technology and Innovation, Mr. Stanley Peters\n\n\n\nThe Head, Human Resources, Mr. Rowland Ogbonda, pointed out that the company is expanding the frontiers and setting a new benchmark in the Nigerian fintech space by giving unrivalled opportunities to highly skilled tech talents with non-traditional education to join its workforce and become part of a team that is solving real-life problems for its target markets.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are many talented innovators and software engineers with disruptive ideas that they are eager to unleash. Therefore, we have scrapped the university degree requirement, and are prioritizing technical depth and capabilities above years of experience for tech candidates, even as we try to champion inclusion in our recruitment process. With our culture of continuous learning, improvement and upskilling, successful attendees would certainly realise their full potential with us\u201d, Mr. Ogbonda added.\n\nFurther buttressing this position, Head, Enterprise Technology Solutions, Mr. Lanre Afodunrinbi, disclosed that the company\u2019s expansion to other parts of Africa made it necessary to beef up the Technology Team to continually deliver superior solutions to its different markets.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the youths and are giving them an opportunity to expand their knowledge and capabilities by selecting the smartest among them to leverage our African expansion and other growth initiatives. This will expose, challenge and motivate them to seek far-reaching solutions to perennial payment problems. Through this, we are also contributing to the economy and reducing the unemployment figures in Nigeria. Initiatives like our open house will go a long way towards curbing brain drain, as young and tech-savvy Nigerians will no longer jump on the next flight in search of greener pastures, when they can have the same opportunities here\u201d, Mr. Afodunrinbi concluded.\n\nAt the end of the session, participants were given a dose of Accelerex\u2019s hospitality, and were treated to upscale dining, gift packs and a free ride to and from the venue. The event gave prospective talents an immersive experience of the Accelerex culture in a warm, relaxed and engaging environment, which made the company an attractive career choice for them.\n\nAccelerex is renowned for its pedigree in innovation, world-class technology, excellent customer service and a commitment to provide fintech solutions that evolve with customers\u2019 needs across Africa.

Justice Esther Edigin for her contribution to the peace and development of the state, pledging that his government will sustain ongoing reforms in the judiciary.\n\nObaseki made the pledge when he received Justice Edigin who was on a valedictory visit to the governor at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nEdigin, who will be retiring on Monday, May 17, 2021, was sworn-in as the seventh substantive Chief Judge of Edo State on Friday, November 22, 2019, following the retirement of Hon. Justice Esohe Ikponmwen from the state\u2019s public service.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cWe have been very consistent, as a government, about the judiciary. The Judiciary is the anchor on which our democracy rests and as such must be treated and given its due place in our democracy.\n\n\u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to cover more grounds as desired in terms of judiciary transformation in Edo State. The Executive is currently going through that process as we have reforms to show; the legislature is also pushing for a very hard transformation and it will be our joy carrying the judiciary joins in this trend to ensure the transformation and modernization of the judiciary system.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki said his administration will continue to cooperate and work with the judiciary to make it more effective and efficient in discharging its responsibilities.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are dealing with a new world and nobody expected it as we were caught napping. Various institutions and states rely solely on one major source of resources. This is not good for us; it should be about our collective survival and not individual survival; we either sail or sink together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make Edo State the judiciary hub of this zone. As a government, we want to thank you for your services to Edo State. We will continue to reform the Judiciary system,\u201d he reassured.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Judge commended Governor Obaseki for the cordial relationship and cooperation with the Judiciary.\n\nShe said: \u201cl am here today to pay you a valedictory visit as part of events marking my disengagement from the Judiciary and Government of Edo State.\n\n\u201cI will be retiring next week, Monday, May 17, 2021. I want to thank the Edo State Government for the cooperation with the Judiciary. The government facilitated the construction and handover of 12 modern Courts to the Judiciary.

          "text": "Apex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has condemned in strong terms, what it said is a \u201cshoot-on-sight\u201d order by President Muhammadu Buhari to the Nigerian military against protesting Igbo youth, warning that such was call for another pogrom and genocide.\n\nOhanaeze said the alleged move would commence from Orlu, Imo State, in the next few days, adding that the secret plot was recently elaborated by a report ran by Sahara Reporters.\n\nOhanaeze\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, who said this in a statement on Monday, noted that the deployment of soldiers in Igboland recently confirmed the reports.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has been drawn to the \u2018Shoot-on-Sight Order\u2019 given to Nigerian soldiers against Igbo youths in the coming weeks. Sahara Reporters of May 8 elaborated on the new secret plan, which, by the grace of God, has come to the public domain. The report further revealed that the exercise would commence from Orlu in Imo State. This is very disturbing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of deployment of northern military officers to the South East lends credence to the above report. Sahara Reporters revealed that in preparation for the above, the Nigerian army has posted Northern Muslims as commanders over its operations and brigades in Anambra, Imo, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Benue, Edo, Delta and Rivers.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra, the Cantonment Commandant of the 302 Artillery Regiment, Onitsha is Col. Abdulsalam Sambo, a northern Muslim; in Imo, the Commander of 34 Brigade, Obinze, is Brig-Gen. Ibrahim Tukura, another northerner; in Abia, the Commander of 14 Brigade, Ohafia, is Brig-Gen M. Ibrahim, a northerner; while in Akwa Ibom, the Commander of 2 Brigade, Uyo, is Brig-Gen. Faruk Mijinyawa, another northerner. This is truly worrisome!\u201d\n\nPresident-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Professor George Obiozor, had admonished the Nigerian government to learn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism, but seek possible peaceful options that guarantee national unity and peaceful coexistence.\n\nObiozor, according to the group, lamented: \u201cSubnational consciousness or ethnocentric nationalism, which is a dangerous form of nationalism to national unity has taken over Nigeria. The dream of Nigeria\u2019s unity is receding fast with violence, crises and conflicts.\u201d\n\nOgbonnia stated that Ndigbo were unequivocal that the current problems confronting Nigeria were a product of sustained orchestrated injustice in governance.\n\nOhanaeze urged the Federal Government to refrain from the use of force in resolving the present national crises.\n\n\u201cHistory shows that military and violent means to solve the national question is bound to fail, as it leads to further national fractionalisation, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration, as in all empires or multi-national states or countries,\u201d it added.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has vowed to tackle those launching deadly attacks on the nation\u2019s security personnel with overwhelming force.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said this on Tuesday in Lagos at a meeting with Online Publishers.\n\nHe said the growing dangerous trend was a declaration of war against the nation which would be resisted by force.\n\n\u201cSoldiers as well as police, customs and other security agents have been killed and maimed in some parts of the country in this growing trend of targeting security forces.\n\n\u201cI want to say unequivocally, that any attack on our security men and women is an attack on the state and a declaration of war against the nation.\n\n\u201cIt follows, therefore, that this will be countered with overwhelming force,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cWhen those whose responsibility it is to protect us are themselves being subjected to mindless attacks, it can only be for one reason only: To instill fear and evoke a sense of pervasive insecurity among the people.\n\n\u201cWhether known or unknown gunmen, those engaging in this dastardly act will pay dearly for their actions.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the security challenges confronting the nation were systemic.\n\nHe said in addition to kinetic efforts, the government was embarking on various non-kinetic measures to most effectively tackle the challenges.\n\nHe recalled that his ministry on April 8, held a Town Hall Meeting on national security in Kaduna which came out with an implementable 10-point agenda.\n\nMohammed said the recommendations from the meeting included, political restructuring instead of separation, qualitative and compulsory primary education for all children of school age.\n\nHe said the meeting also resolved on state police, expansion, retraining of military, police and security agencies as well as providing them with modern equipment.\n\nThe meeting also resolved on Local Government autonomy as well as constitutional role of maintaining peace and security for traditional rulers within their domain.\n\nHe said it was also recommended that ranches, grazing reserves should be established with modern amenities to check the trans-humans of the herders and farmers-herdsmen clashes.\n\nThe minister said resolutions from the town hall meeting had been taken to the National Economic Council for considerations.\n\nThe Minister also used the occasion to clarify his statement on the issue of insecurity as it relates to the regime of Gen. Murtala Mohammed, according to him, media report that he blamed the regime of Gen. Murtala Mohammed for spate of insecurity in Nigeria is \u201cfake news and disinformation\u2019\u2019.\n\nMohammed, who expressed dismay over the reports clarified on what he said, when he recently featured on Channels Television\u2019s News programme.\n\n\u201cIt is amazing at times how people interpret ones\u2019 opinions and views in a very negative sense.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that, the lead speaker at a Town Hall Meeting we held in Kaduna recently, made reference to the retreat by the former military Head of State Gen. Yakubu Gowon, after the civil war.\n\n\u201cHe said that at the end of the retreat, there was consensus that all children born after the civil war must be given free and compulsory primary education.\n\n\u201cI simply elaborated on this information and said that if subsequent governments after Gen. Gowon had perfected this pledge, the bandits and kidnappers today will have no market to recruit their followers.\n\n\u201cI said we have about 13 million out of school children and if successive government had taken the decision at the Gowon\u2019s retreat seriously, we will not be where we are today.\n\n\u201cThere was nowhere I blamed Gen. Murtala Mohammed, but we are in the era of disinformation and fake news,\u2019\u2019 he explained.\n\nThe minister said he was also misunderstood on his position that kidnapping and banditry were not offences that could be prosecuted by the Federal Government.\n\nHe said while his position was correct, it was not meant to absorb the federal government from the responsibility of fighting crimes as it was misinterpreted by some people.\n\n\u201cI was responding to the opposition PDP which said that the Federal Government has not prosecuted any bandits or kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI said it is not the responsibility of the federal government to prosecute bandits or kidnappers.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility of the federal government is to hunt them down, arrest them and hand them over to the states judiciary to prosecute.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, this morning, it was reported that 48 kidnappers were neutralised by the military in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThose who were arrested will be handed over to the Zamfara state government for prosecution,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister reiterated that there were some laws which were at the exclusive execution by the federal and state level respectively.\n\n\u201cAs of today and until we amend the law, the federal government cannot prosecute suspected kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u201cThat was why the notorious kidnap kigpin, Chikwudubem Onwuamadike, also known as Evans is being prosecuted in the Lagos state court and not in Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said Nigerians must be concerned about the spate and effects of fake news and disinformation.",
          "summary": "The Federal Government has vowed to tackle those launching deadly attacks on the nation\u2019s security personnel with overwhelming force.\nHe said the growing dangerous trend was a declaration of war against the nation which would be resisted by force.\nHe recalled that his ministry on April 8, held a Town Hall Meeting on national security in Kaduna which came out with an implementable 10-point agenda.\n\u201cThere was nowhere I blamed Gen. Murtala Mohammed, but we are in the era of disinformation and fake news,\u2019\u2019 he explained.\nThe minister reiterated that there were some laws which were at the exclusive execution by the federal and state level respectively.",

They dwelt on the current security situation, agitations, restructuring, prospects for interstate collaboration and partnerships as well as on the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the communiqu\u00e9, the meeting affirms, that \u201cthe peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\n\n\u201cWe observed that the incursion of armed herders, criminals and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria; noted that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South.\n\n\u201cGiven this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South (including cattle movement to the South by foot).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems; agreed that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions, which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism.\u201d\n\nThey also recommended that, \u201cIn view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency;\n\nthat in deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government Agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogenous; resolved to foster cooperation among the Southern States and the nation at large\u201d\n\nThey also expressed concern about the continued gridlock on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway and the chokehold it has exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.\n\nThey added: \u201cThe meeting therefore recommended the activation and establishment of ports in other States of the federation to create new jobs and promote socio-economic activities in the country;\n\nthe meeting expressed concern on the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and therefore suggested greater coordination and cooperation between Federal and State Governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cExpressed very grave concern on the security challenge currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr. President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people; and expressed gratitude to our host, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for his generosity and hospitality.\u201d\n\nOther governors present were Dr. Victor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, Chief Willie Obiano (Anambra) and Diri Duoye (Bayelsa). Others are Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Oluwaseyi Makinde (Oyo) and Ezenwo Nyesom Wike (Rivers).\n\nAside from Cross River and Osun states\u2019 helmsmen who were absent, Imo and Akwa Ibom were represented by their deputy governors.",

          "text": "*Says review will not affect pump price\n\nDoosuur Iwambe, Abuja\n\nExecutive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), Mr. Ahmed Bobboi, has said that the Federal Government is putting in place measures to review the Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) template.\n\nThis measure Bobboi explained would help in addressing the demands of members of the Nigerian Transport Owners Association (NARTO) that recently withheld their services over the non-increment of their cost of bridging to N9.11.\n\nSpeaking during an interaction with journalists in Abuja, Bobboi however allays fears saying, the review will not affect the pump price of the product but would rather cushion the plights of transporters in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are looking for a way of coming up with a temporary measure to review the template without adding anything to cushion and provide succour for the transporters\u2019\u2019.\n\nRecall that the leadership of the Petrol Tanker Drivers (PTD), withdrew their services on April 20, 2021 following the failure of the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) to negotiate the renewal of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for new working conditions for the drivers.\n\nThey also demanded the compulsory installation of safety valves in all petroleum trucks to protect the inflammable contents from spilling over in case of road mishaps.\n\nHowever, Bobboi disclosed that government was in talks with all parties to ensure a permanent solution to the problem adding that despite the provision of a new transportation cost of N9.11 in the new petrol pricing template, the implementation was delayed by the negotiation between labour and the government.\n\nHe further disclosed that the Federal Government is considering the possibility of transporting petroleum products for marketers by rail across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at the possibility of getting marketers to transport their products by rail because government is reviving many of the critical rail lines,\u201d he added.\n\nThe PEF boss further revealed that plans were in place to subsidise the transportation and distribution costs of Liquefied Petroleum Gas otherwise known as cooking gas.\n\nHe explained that the bridging scheme for gas is to ensure its affordability and accessibility across the country, as well as the addition of value to the economy in many ways.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to introduce the bridging scheme to gas because government has declared this year till 2030 as a decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAnd we say if this (petrol price equalisation) is working for the economy for over 45 years now effectively, if we can extend the practice to gas we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain.\n\n\u201cIt will help in getting the consumers in those areas to accept the usage of gas and abandon the age-long use of firewood in cooking with its attendant problems and challenges including health hazards and deforestation which causes a lot of problems in the country.\n\n\u201cIt will also makes it affordable to the people because if you incentives the marketer by paying for his transportation to take it to the last mile, the consumer will also be incentives because the marketer will bring down his price so that it will be affordable and accessible to consumer\u2019\u2019,Bobboi added.",

And anybody can come up later in the year or in the nearest future to challenge us that we collected money for the work we had not done.\n\n\u201cBut, now, any proclamation from the Supreme Court is law. This is law. A judgement has been given, the money is due to us and we can collect it now. When he (Makinde) wanted to pay us, the question was, why will he pay us? Why will he even sack us in the first instance when the court said it\u2019s wrong? Why would you do that? If you had done that and you said you want to pay us, that in itself is corruption, so we will never be part of a thing.\n\n\u201cFor us, if we had collected the money at the time, and when people see us, will they not say it was all about the money?\n\n\u201cBut for us, it was not about the money or the office, it is about the rule of law and I am saying it, I personally don\u2019t ever have interest in contesting any local government elections again in my life.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Crack in Edo PDP: Party leaders in bitter fight with Obaseki",
          "text": "By Jethro Ibileke/Benin\n\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Edo state, has accused the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, over alleged plan to dissolve the elected executive committee members of the party at all levels.\n\nThe party accused Obaeki of trying to push aside the state chairman of the party, Dr. Tony Aziegbemi.\n\nThe state chairman and secretary of the party, Dr. Tony Aziegbemi and Hillary Otsu, respectively, in a letter dated 10th May, 2021, and addressed to the national chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, accused Obaseki of hosting a \u201cpurported leaders\u2019 meeting\u201d at which only three old members of PDP attended, against 10 former APC members who decamped with the Governor.\n\nThey alleged that the looming crisis results from the acquiescence of the National Working Committee members who negotiated Godwin Obaseki\u2019s movement to PDP, to reach a verbal or written agreement on the integration of the new members.\n\nThey berated Obaseki for convening such a meeting, which they alleged was aimed at ambushing state chairman of the party.\n\nThey further insisted that if the Governor wants to harmonize the party in the state, as he claimed, it must start from his office, with the replacement of his deputy, Philip Shaibu and Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Osarodion Ogie with old PDP members.\n\nThe letter reads in part:\n\n\u201cAt an emergency meeting today, the state chairman briefed the State Working Committee and LGA party chairmen, on the purported state leaders\u2019 meeting hosted in Edo State Government House, by Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, with Hief Tom Ikimi, Dr. Raymond Dokpesi and Chief Mike Oghiadomhe and others in attendance on the 8th of May 2021, with the agenda to propose a dissolution of the Edo state PDP executive committees at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe expanded State Working Committee and Local Government Chairmen of the Edo state PDP reject in its entirety, the proposal by the above mentioned meeting to dissolve the legitimately elected executive committee members of the PDP at the ward, local government and state levels.\n\n\u201cWe also condemn totally, the convening of such a meeting aimed at ambushing our State Chairman (who is constitutionally empowered to call such a meeting) at a meeting where only three (3) old PDP members, namely Dr. Raymond Dokpesi, Chief Tom Ikimi and Chief Mike Oghiadomhe, as against ten (10) members from the Godwin Obaseki faction that decamped from the APC to PDP.\n\n\u201cWe hereby reiterate to the National Executive Committee of our party that the issue of dissolution of executive committees in Edo State is \u201csubjudice\u201d and it will be an act of contempt of court to revisit it by the Party.\n\n\u201cThe genesis of this looming crisis results from the acquiescence of the National Working Committee members who negotiated Godwin Obaseki\u2019s movement to PDP, to reach a verbal or written agreement on the integration of the new members, vis a vis the sharing of appointments, after the elections had been won.\n\n\u201cWe therefore condemn Gov. Obaseki\u2019s re-appointment of his former SSG without any consideration for the legacy PDP he joined.\n\n\u201cTo this end, they have consistently sang a tune of \u201charmonization\u201d ever since Obaseki was sworn in, know that he now has the \u201cyam and the knife\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved strongly, that if any harmonization MUST take place, it MUST start from the Governor\u2019s office, where his Deputy Governor should resign and a Deputy nominated from the old PDP is sworn in. This can be a spring board for broad harmonization across the state party organs.\u201d\n\nAccording to the protest letter, \u201cthe proposed dissolution and, or harmonization are designed to hold Edo people and the PDP to ransom by the Obaseki led administration,\u201d which he said they will not accept.\n\n\u201cEdo people voted for PDP and Godwin Obaseki to deliver the dividends of democracy to them, but if Gov. Obaseki wills to conduct governance by a triumvirate of the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the SSG, so be it. If he wishes to appoint only his friends and former APC colleagues in his cabinet and sundry positions, and leave out the legacy PDP members, so be it.\n\n\u201cWe, the Peoples Democratic Party leadership will not accede to any form of harmonization that has no backing or interpretation in our party constitution,\u201d\n\nAccording to them, Obaseki was being misguided and misled by three groups of individuals who they said are bent on bringing the party to disrepute, namely, aspirants for 2023 and 2024 elections (Philip Shaibu and Osarodion Ogie), congress losers (Dr. Raymond Dokpesi, Chief Mike Oghiadomhe and Chief Tom Ikimi) and alleged godfathers coming from APC (Chief Osaro Idah, Chief Charles Idahosa, Chief Henry Tenebe, Sen. Ehigie Uzamere and Mr. Theo Okoh).\n\n\u201cWe have consistently bent over backwards, to a breaking point, in our efforts to integrate Gov. Obaseki\u2019s former APC supporters.\n\n\u201cAt the Zonal congress held in Port Harcourt recently, the two positions zoned to Edo State (Financial Secretary and Ex-Officio member), were conceded to the Governor without any deliberation by the party hierarchy. The National Ex-officio position was also conceded to the Governor without any deliberations.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, how far do we have to go to show good faith? Let it be known that we will not concede anymore positions, and those already nominated will be recalled and reallocate,\u201d the letter concluded.",

The first step is to tone down the rhetoric.\n\nREAD ALSO: Security Intervention: Southern Governors Meet In Asaba\n\n\u201cNow, there is a growing dangerous trend which I will like to comment on. It is the practice of launching deadly attacks against the nation\u2019s security personnel. Soldiers as well as police, customs, and other security agents have been killed and maimed in some parts of the country in this growing trend of targeting security forces.\n\n\u201cI want to say, unequivocally, that any attack on our security men and women is an attack on the state and a declaration of war against the nation. It follows, therefore, that this will be countered with overwhelming force.\u201d\n\nNigeria has been experiencing a series of security threats ranging from terrorism, banditry, militancy, cultism among others in several parts of the country.\n\nThe country has been battling terrorism for more than a decade which has killed 36,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands in the northeast.\n\nThe Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) split from the jihadist group Boko Haram in 2016 and has since become a dominant threat in Nigeria, attacking troops and bases while killing and kidnapping passengers at bogus checkpoints.\n\nOn March 1, jihadist fighters burnt down a United Nations humanitarian compound in the town of Dikwa after dislodging troops, killing six civilians.\n\nNigeria\u2019s jihadist violence has spread to neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger, prompting a regional military coalition to fight the insurgents.",

Development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South. Given this scenario, it becomes imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South \u2013 including cattle movement to the South by foot.\u201d\n\nThe governors also urged the federal government to support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nFollowing several agitations by various groups in the country, the southern governors called on the federal government to take bold steps in restructuring the country.\n\n\u201cThe progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian Federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance our commitment to and practice of true federalism,\u201d the governors said.\n\n\u201cIn view of widespread agitations among our various peoples for greater inclusiveness in existing governance arrangements, the Federal Government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is need to review appointments into Federal Government Agencies (including Security Agencies) to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogeneous.\n\nThe governors also called for the creation of more ports in the country to reduce the burden on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway being the sole outlet from the Apapa Wharf.\n\n\u201cThe continued gridlock on the Oshodi \u2013 Apapa Expressway and the chokehold it has exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.
