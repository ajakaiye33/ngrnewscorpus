Its vision is to establish a multi-dimensional scheme that addresses and mitigates the challenges associated with poverty, diseases, illiteracy, violence, and others. And this, it has achieved in over one decade through productive partnerships with both government and private agencies.\u201d\n\nHe described the medium as being notorious for carrying out \u201csensationalist hatchet job on well-known public figures and/or organizations with towering reputations for his paymasters, in the guise of \u201cinvestigative journalism.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians would recall that the Amaechis are not his first targets as he has pulled similar stunts on several other prominent personalities including the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we urge members of the public and our local and international partners to discountenance the report in its entirety as it is bereft of any truth. We have since briefed our Legal Counsel and subject to their professional advice, we shall be taking the appropriate legal steps in due course as the circumstances may warrant,\u201d Evukowhiroro said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\n\u201cA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever.

He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\n\n\u201cNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds.

Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave the way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\n\u201cKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside from the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do the same.

          "text": "The Benue State Government has accused the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai of misleading President Muhammadu Buhari on issues of security in Nigeria.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Governor El-Rufai had in a statement, accused his Benue counterpart, Governor Ortom of using the insecurity in Benue to attack the Federal Government in order to cover up his failure.\n\nReacting, in a statement issued on Saturday by Terver Akase, the Chief Press Secretary to the state governor, the state government said El-Rufai is unqualified to speak on security issues in the country owing to his inability to curb kidnapping and killings in his state.\n\nThe statement also accused the Governor of dividing the people of Kaduna State stressing that Ortom is not the cause of the high level of insecurity in Kaduna State.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\n\u201cA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\n\n\u201cNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on a daily basis?\n\n\u2018El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave the way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\n\u201cKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside from the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do the same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\n\u201cNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him.

Thank you again to all who donated.\u201d\n\nThe complete audit was carried out by SIAO, for a period of six months which ended on 31 March 2021.\n\nFEMCO\u2019s action sparked outrage on social media.\n\nMany believe the audit should be a public document especially after allegations Bitcoin donations the group received were mismanaged.\n\nNigerians took to social media to call out individuals and organisations that crowd-funded during the protest to be held accountable for donations they received.\n\nFreelance Journalist David Hundeyin said: \u201cAnyway Femco\u2019s clear and egregious dishonesty isn\u2019t among the top 50 problems currently facing Nigeria and it doesn\u2019t really change anything so I won\u2019t follow this matter anymore.

          "text": "By Robert Egbe\n\nOne of the coordinators of the #EndSARS protests Serah Ibrahim has presented fresh videos and pictures appearing to show people allegedly shot dead or injured by the Nigerian Army at the Lekki Tollgate on October 20, 2020.\n\nIbrahim\u2019s evidence was played before the Lagos State Judicial Panel probing police brutality and the tollgate incident in continuation of her testimony about the army\u2019s role in ending the protests.\n\nThe witness, a freelance auditor, first appeared before the panel on April 18, when she alleged that at least 10 people were shot dead by the soldiers.\n\nShe also tendered flash drives containing the videos and pictures, some of which she said she shot personally with her iPhone.\n\nThe army, which appeared thrice before the panel, denied the allegations, saying it fired blank bullets in the air to disperse the crowd.\n\nIt has, however, shunned repeated summons by the panel requiring it to respond to petitioners\u2019 further questions and evidence debunking its claims.\n\nThere are no fewer than 14 petitions relating to the shooting incident, out of the 235 petitions received by the panel between October and December 2020.\n\nIbrahim resumed her testimony while being led by Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Mr Olumide-Fusika.\n\nThe videos, played before the panel, showed the soldiers present at the toll gate, shooting into the air. It also seemed that they also fired at the protesters.\n\nIt showed what appeared to be bodies \u2013 about at least five \u2013 with several other protesters injured.\n\nOne after the other, Ibrahim played the videos, explaining in the process that the soldiers not only shot at harmless protesters, they even took away some of the dead bodies.\n\nThe witness said the videos and pictures were evidence that the army lied about firing only blanks.\n\nIn one of the videos, the witness showed the entrance of one of the hospitals that victims were taken to, saying the hospital was overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cThat is the entrance of a hospital, there were people all over. They were attending to people at the car park,\u201d Ms Ibrahim said.\n\nAccording to her, soldiers took away the bodies of several protesters that they shot.\n\nShe specifically mentioned that the soldiers took away one of the shooting victims, Lekan Sanusi. Sanusi, an active protester, was thought to be dead.\n\nIt was later found out he was taken to MRS Hospital at Bonny Camp where an unidentified nurse helped him to escape.\n\n\u201cThey took the bodies to the Military Hospital. We got to know because one of the people in the van that was not yet dead said he counted 11 bodies. It was one of the nurses there that saw that he was still alive that helped him,\u201d she said.\n\nLast October 30, the panel paid an unscheduled visit to the Military Hospital as part of its investigation into the Lekki shooting incident but did not find any corpse at the morgue as the hospital was undergoing renovation.\n\nBut the witness insisted that the bodies taken from the scene by the soldiers were taken to the Military Hospital.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSome people didn\u2019t let the army carry some of the dead bodies of people that they know.

          "title": "Those around Buhari are leading him the wrong way \u2013Ahamba",
          "text": "Elder statesman and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ahamba has accused those around President Muhammadu Buhari of leading him down the wrong path.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, Ahamba also reminded the Igbo not to expect anyone to donate the presidency to them in 2023, even as he charged them to go all out and fight to make an Igbo man president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nMany people conclude that the Buhari government has failed. You were an associate of Buhari, or you worked with him sometime ago. Is this the Buhari you knew? What do you think changed?\n\nThe difference is that, we wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen, but those who got into government with him allowed it to happen. This is the Buhari I knew, but the problem is the people surrounding him, who want him to go the wrong way. When we were with him, we all wanted him to go the right way, but ethnic interests informed the exit of some of us because some people around him didn\u2019t allow some of us to remain with him because they know we would intervene and would not allow such things to happen. I had no quarrel with him. We didn\u2019t disagree on anything. We were just manipulated out.\n\nINEC has released the election timetable for the 2023 general elections. Some are saying certain parts of the country, like the South-East, should have it, while some others think otherwise. What is your candid opinion on this?\n\nMy candid opinion is that in this type of situation where there is no provision about rotation in the constitution, the interest of the nation demands that each part of Nigeria be given a chance. It is on that ground that I said it is best if the South-East is given a chance, not as of right, but in terms of equity and to bring peace and justice to the country.\n\nWhether they will do it or not depends on how they vote on that day. Let the candidates from South-East who want to be president move out as others are moving out and let us start assessing them. It cannot be donated. Nobody will donate presidency to the South-East. You have to fight for it. But I have not seen any candidate yet.\n\nNigeria is witnessing very challenging times, with insecurity in many parts of the country. What gave rise to this?\n\nThere is complacency in governance. Not hitting the iron while it was hot is a reason for this problem. Delay of action is dangerous, so we are just having the result of delay of action. These things have shown that they will happen in the last two or three years. Nobody did anything about them and they matured.\n\nPeople are saying that with the high level of insecurity, 2023 elections may not hold. If that comes to being what is the implication, because the tenure of this government elapses by 2023?\n\nMy granddaughter was asked by her grandmother what happened about something. The little girl asked the grandmother ,\u2018am I God?\u2019 How will I know what will happen, am I God? Let\u2019s see whether it holds or not.\n\nThen what is the legal implication if it doesn\u2019t hold?\n\nThere are provisions in the constitution about that. When that time comes, I think the Attorney General will give the relevant advice, while private lawyers will challenge or support the advice.\n\nThe Federal Government is alleging that there is a plot to overthrow the government of President Buhari. Is this a pointer that the APC government is not doing well or might have fallen out of favour with the people?\n\nThe government wants to create an opportunity to destabilise the opposition by making them suspects of a non-existence offence. That is all. I don\u2019t know what type of a security organ that will tell you that there is a plot to topple government, instead of getting ready to nip it in the bud. Last year December, there was crisis over the invasion of the Capitol in Washington DC. The security arm discovered it and reported to the appropriate body and they nipped it in the bud and it never happened.\n\nHere, we now shout it so that we can arrest innocent people and demand money from them. We have a problem in this country. If they were sharp enough to discover that there was a plot, you nip it in the bud; you don\u2019t go and allow it to happen so that you can punish people or start punishing people without it happening. I learnt the other day they were saying that they would be arresting probable people planning to destabilise the state; that they will start arresting them at home. So, if I\u2019m in my house and you are in your house and you stay there and imagine that I\u2019m plotting something, you will come to my house and arrest me because I\u2019m planning to do what is in my mind. I\u2019m a lawyer, and I know that you don\u2019t talk about a thing until a step is taken relevant to that offence you said happened.\n\nIf there is anarchy everywhere and people are complaining, is that a plot? Even the person giving the warning has seen that there is trouble. Why is he saying that somebody wants to create trouble? Can we create a worse trouble than the one we have now? All this is a mark of incompetence; they should put competent people in place. A lot of square pegs have been forced into round holes, which is part of the problems we have in this nation.\n\nSome Igbo people say, based on what the country is passing through under President Buhari, that they have been vindicated for not voting for him all along, even when he had Igbo running mates. Do you share same sentiments?\n\nDid he score 100 per cent in other places? He didn\u2019t, which means that there were Hausa-Fulani who didn\u2019t vote for him. The issue was that, who was the candidate? They preferred a candidate. It has nothing to do with ethnic or anything. At that time, they preferred a candidate to him. It is not a question of being vindicated because you didn\u2019t vote for Buhari; I reject that because I\u2019m an Igbo man, a prominent one for that matter. It was not true that anybody was against him. The issue I think was a preferred candidate at that material time and I campaigned against that position at that time. It is a political game; there is no vindication about it at all.\n\nEven when he had great Igbo men and others like you and his running mates who were also Igbo?\n\nIt depends on who he chose as running mates. Maybe if he had chosen other persons as running mates, it could have been better. I remember at that time there was hardly an election; votes were declared even when voting was going on. That was the era. I did the election petition and I have the documents; if you challenge me, I will bring the documents.\n\nDo you mean that Buhari could have won that election?\n\nEven if he did not win, he was not fairly treated at those elections.\n\nWhen you open pages or newspapers, the social media, what you read is, Nigeria is breaking up, or Nigeria will break up? Why are we having such fears at this time when other nations are conquering other planets?\n\nBreaking up of Nigeria, is it a plate? It is not easy to break up. Nigeria can disintegrate, everybody going his own way because the centre cannot hold. It is true that our constitution says that Nigeria is indissoluble. Whether it is dissoluble or indissoluble is a human act towards a project. That one may never happen, but disintegration is uncontrolled, but that shouldn\u2019t occupy our minds. What should occupy our minds is what to do to prevent it and move forward. Look at India, when I was in secondary school, they used to come here with degrees and we employed them in our secondary schools and paid them higher school salaries and now, we are running there for many things. What is wrong with us?\n\nAre you sure a worst Nigeria will not come into the disintegrated areas? You can disintegrate and in each component you have a good portion of Nigeria attitude inside it. It is the same thing. There may be worst Nigeria in the disintegrated areas. So let us solve it now that we are together. I believe that the only answer is to allow the areas some air of ability to do things for themselves at their own rate, not saying that the whole Nigeria must move at the same rate every time. Take for example, people say they want true federation, but they want salary to be the same everywhere. It can\u2019t happen in a true federation. It is not possible for some states to pay what Lagos can pay; some states cannot pay what Rivers or Kano states can pay. In a true federation, things should be according to those areas, but the Nigerian Labour Congress said it would destabilise Nigeria if you go to true federation with labour matters. People say they want true federation, yet they want the Federal Government to fund local governments while the states create the local governments. This is incongruous. If we want true federalism, we will have it. If we don\u2019t want, we continue with what I call \u2018unitary federalism\u2019 which is a new trend in politics.\n\nIn this direction, are you calling for restructuring, but many are still confused over how it is going to be carried out?\n\nI stand for restructuring; I don\u2019t stand for secession of any part of Nigeria. Let us restructure and go back to our federation agreement. We agreed on certain things before we became a federation. Let us revisit those things and see the ones we can take now and there will be peace in this place.\n\nWhen the current leadership says restructuring is not an option, what other options do we have?\n\nWe keep crying and trying to get it right, but in the end, we may come to Chinua Achebe, \u2018Things Fall Apart\u2019 and in another book, \u2018The Centre Cannot Hold\u2019. When the centre cannot hold, things will fall apart.\n\nAs it is in Nigeria today, what are the consequences of things falling apart?\n\nIt portends anarchy because before instability, there will be anarchy. We can ill afford that.\n\nSome people hold the view that Britain is the architect of our woes. They say Nigeria remains the last experiment of the British government, as other nations they brought together have gone their separate ways, each enjoying peace. They mention India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and others. What do you say to this?\n\nI agree, but what we don\u2019t know is why they decided to remain together when others were going their ways, because there is nothing happening now that the leadership of those days didn\u2019t see. Look, Southern Cameroun was part of Nigeria and they quickly eased themselves off, but the others remained together. I asked at the National Conference that our elders have not told us why they remained together when others were going their ways. Until we get that question answered, we may not know why they continued. If you look at the constitution, you find out that as at the time we got independent, regions have prime ministers, not premiers and they have their own governors, apart from governors general. They had their own constitution, but in 1978, some people went to the Constituent Assembly. I don\u2019t know whether they understood what they were doing. They said they were creating a federal constitution and they said there is only one constitution, the national constitution. There we became a unitary federalism and now we are crying. We were doing parliamentary system, but they said it is presidential they wanted. When you have to send people for something, you send people that know the issue, but you find good tailors and good carpenters who know nothing about law being sent to constitutional conferences. I do not know what we have now that was not there then. What we have to do now is to find a solution. Let\u2019s stop talking of how we came to this point; let us find a solution to our present circumstance and find out how we can remain together because if we split in a disorganised manner, it will be very bad.\n\nTalking about the 1999 Constitution, many people argue that what was agreed on is not what we have in the constitution. They said then Head of State, Abdulasam Abubakar handed over the document to Prof Awual Yadudu, who doctored it and produced what we have now.\n\nI don\u2019t like this lamentation about the 1999 Constitution. It is 99 per cent of what was in the 1979 Constitution. Before you complain of the 1999 Constitution, you have to first complain of the 1979 Constitution. If the problem started with the 1979 Constitution, why do you allow it to continue in 1999? Who did you send to the Constituent Assembly? I keep saying it, why would you send people who don\u2019t know anything about constitution to represent you in a constitutional conference? Everything is political and here we are today. The question of accepting the 1979 Constitution and holding the 1999 Constitution as fraud is not acceptable to me because they are the same. If people scampered to go and occupy offices based on the constitution, why did they go there instead of rejecting the constitution and face the military? Silence is acceptance.\n\nBut when Obasanjo came into power, one of his advisers said as the military has been eased off, their next plan was to work on an acceptable constitution. But that never came to pass?\n\nIt is not easy. Those who said that never knew how tedious it is making a constitution in a civilian regime; it is not as easy as making it under a military regime. In an undeveloped country like ours where everything is selfishly considered, not nationally considered, it is not easy. It was a wrong move to accept it first and then reject it later. That was a cowardly approach to a situation.\n\nHow do we move forward?\n\nThe National Assembly has power to make laws for peace, order and good government in Nigeria. That is their jurisdiction. They should make a law creating a constitutional conference or a constituent assembly to give us another constitution. We need to sit down and discuss our problem. We need to sit and discuss this situation of somebody having the power to make appointment of one ethnic group, a minority for that matter, for the whole country. The National Assembly should know its responsibility. When a president or governor begins to act contrary to the constitution, they have a duty to remove him from office. But what do we have now? It is our party; it is not our party. They go there to worship party and not the peace, good, order of government that the constitution asks them to do. I can\u2019t do anything about that. I will only complain as I have been complaining. Where I see such a thing I will speak out and go back to my house. If we follow 60 per cent of what is in that constitution, there will be peace in Nigeria.\n\nYou said the National Assembly should make a law to set up a constitutional conference or constituent assembly that will midwife a new constitution. But they said there is no need for that as they were already there to amend the constitution.\n\nThey have no power to amend the constitution. Go to Section Nine, the word, \u2018alter\u2019. Not to alter or amend the constitution; they can alter any provision of the constitution but not to alter or amend the constitution. If you say there is no difference between alteration and amendment, it is not true. It is just like saying that there is no difference between epidemic and pandemic. One contains the other; they are not the same. They think they are doing the right thing, but they are derailing. All these going around in the name of constitutional amendments are just a waste of time.",

          "title": "Untold story of Rev Fr. Mbaka",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nFiery Catholic priest, Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka is in the eye of the storm. Thousands of worshipers and members of his Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), on Wednesday, took to the streets of Enugu in violent protest over the sudden disappearance of their Spiritual Director.\n\nAt the end of the protest, which lasted over four hours, property belonging to the Catholic Church, including the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, were destroyed.\n\nThe protest, which had never been witnessed in the state almost, led to anarchy in the town. It was quelled when the \u2018missing\u2019 Mbaka reappeared in a black SUV at about 2.50pm, urging his followers to go back to their homes or the Adoration Ground, that he was safe.\n\nBut before then, the residence of the bishop had been vandalized; windows were shattered while air conditioners were damaged. Even water installations were not spared. It took the intervention of some individuals to stop the house from being set ablaze.\n\nMbaka has been in the public eye for quite some time. In 2014, he had prophesised that General Muhammadu Buhari, then presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would defeat former President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 polls.\n\nHis prophecy drew the ire of many, especially in the old Eastern region where Jonathan had teeming supporters.\n\nBarely three years later, he spoke vehemently against the same Buhari\u2019s government that he had prayed for. He warned Nigerian leaders of a looming disaster, which he said would be sparked by the unmitigated bloodletting in the country, while calling on the President to go to Rome to atone for the human carnage going on in the country under his watch.\n\n\u201cSupernatural disaster is coming. Angels are already warming up. Nigerians should not worry; one day there will be vacancy from Abuja. The jet will park and nobody will use it unless they repent.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, had it been that it was the Imams that were killed in Benue or Plateau, the president would have attended their burials.\n\n\u201cGod can prophesy someone into a position. If you know how Nebuchadnezzar became the President. He went there under prophetic order. When God wants to punish His people, He can use a leader. The Nebucadnezzar God later pushed into the bush.\u201d\n\nHe further said that President Buhari was like an egg that was bound to meet a sledgehammer in the nearest future, charging those who were close to the president to ensure he got his message.\n\nHe called himself a microphone speaking as directed by God warning that anybody who would want to attack him because of the message would meet his waterloo.\n\nThat is Rev. Father Camillus Ejike Mbaka, Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry of Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nArguably, one of the most unconventional Catholic priests in Nigeria; Mbaka\u2019s methods and tactics have endeared him to many, with thousands of followers trooping to the adoration ground located at Umuchigbo, Iji Nike; Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State for spiritual encounter every Friday. For all the followership, Mbaka is no stranger to controversies; he rather seems at home with them. No wonder one can hardly think of any other priest that divides opinion more than the charismatic priest.\n\nIn fact, Mbaka said during the first physical service of his church after about five months of closure due to lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic that the country goes \u2018gaga\u2019 anytime he declares prophecies.\n\nHe said, \u201cLike you know, whenever we declare a prophecy here, the whole country goes gaga and they begin to plan evil. But woe betides whoever that should allow himself to be used to try any attack on me or this ministry.\n\n\u201cYou may not like me; I may not be among those you consider as good people, but I know that God is using me to save people and minister succour to mankind.\u201d\n\nFamily background and journey to priesthood\n\nFr. Mbaka is the only son of late Chief Humphrey and Felicia Mbaka. He hails from Amata Ituku in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Humphrey Mbaka\u2019s family stood out for their special talent in palm wine tapping in the community. Ejike as a child helped his father in his palm wine business. He was also close to his mother as he always helped out in domestic chores.\n\nDespite the demand of domestic activities, the young Mbaka also devoted time to Block Rosary. He stood out as one of the leaders of the group at St. Anthony\u2019s Parish, Ituku where he led the prayer team. His father, who was a traditional religion worshipper, seemed to have tolerated his tilt to Christianity until he declared his intention to enter priesthood. This was met with stiff resistance by his late father who allegedly made life a living hell for the intending priest.\n\nMbaka attended St. Vincent\u2019s Secondary School, Agbogugu in Awgu L.G.A of Enugu State, from where he proceeded to the Seat of Wisdom Seminary, Owerri, Imo State and St Joseph\u2019s Seminary Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom State, for his training as a priest. He was ordained a priest on July 29, 1995 and was subsequently posted to Holy Ghost Cathedral, headquarters of Catholic Church in Enugu Diocese as the Assistant Diocesan Administrator.\n\nHe later ventured out on evangelical missions to Capuchin; a religious order of Franciscan friars within the Catholic Church, and Government Technical College (GTC), Enugu, where he founded the Word Prayer Centre of the Eucharistic Jesus which later metamorphosed to the Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nIt was gathered that those early years of priesthood were unbearable for Mbaka as he would hold Mass at the GTC and shortly after the service; the church leadership would come and retrieve the offering. He was not allowed access to the offering; neither was he given accommodation.\n\nAt some point, he lived with a couple in their one-room apartment in the GRA; and most times slept in the car. It was from there that some members who saw the efficacy of his prayers rented a place for him before they eventually commenced putting up structures for the Christ the King\u2019s Parish (CKP), which hosted the adoration ground at the GRA.\n\nHuge crowds troop to the adoration ground every Friday from all parts of the country in search of spiritual encounter. The atmosphere is usually charged and electrifying such that one gets the exact buzz that goes with the Pentecostal fellowships.\n\nAccording to one of the choristers in the ministry, Oluchi Okolo, the singers usually have their works cut out for them as they are expected to sing and keep everyone \u201cin the realm of the spirit\u201d until the man of God arrives. She said once the man of God is sighted, the atmosphere becomes more intense and shouts of \u201cDaddy\u201d, \u201cOga Ndi Oga\u201d, \u201cNwa Ikuku\u201d, \u201c Onyeisi Okanga\u201d, \u201cOga Emma\u201d, and so many other appendages with which Mbaka is known rend the air. She described the feeling as blissful.\n\nThe all-night service proper at the Adoration Ground can best be described as Pentecostal-Catholicism. Without being told, a first time visitor will think he was in a Pentecostal gathering until it was time for the Holy Communion and the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDescribing worship at the Adoration Ground, an observer wrote: \u2018Worship here combines preaching, ecstatic Eucharistic adoration, two Masses, anointing and dance in a way that is hard to imagine for anyone who has not seen it before. Mbaka is a celebrity and a force in the entire South East region, supported by many followers and clergy.\u2019\n\nHowever, in 2016, Mbaka was transferred from the CKP where he had presided for 20 years to Our Lady\u2019s Catholic Church, Emene; a small parish in an obscure part of Enugu as an assistant priest.\n\nHis exit from CKP on January 31, 2016 was a highly emotional exercise as he was escorted by thousands of Catholic faithful in Enugu to his new parish.\n\nSeveral lorries, buses and cars all lined the street in what could be dubbed a triumphal exit that halted economic and other activities for over four hours along major streets where the long convoy passed.\n\nAddressing the crowd before the movement, Mbaka had expressed reservations over the transfer, which he said was calculated to make him suffer by certain leaders of the church.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know we are going to suffer within now and few months to come. I am going to suffer and suffer; I know that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to suffer because I have no place to put my head. I am going to suffer because I have no place to keep the Adoration Ministry\u2019s assets. I know I\u2019m going to suffer.\n\n\u201cFortunately, it is going to happen in the month of lent. So, I am going to use my exit here as a Lenten observance./ but Jesus said it all in John 16:20 to his apostles that you will be sorrowful and the world will be rejoicing but very soon I will turn your sorrow to joy.\n\n\u201cThe quantum of the assets of the Adoration Ministry is the only thing I am bothered about for now. Where am I going to keep them? I am going to stay in one small room that has only one small bed, one small table, little toilet and bathroom.\n\n\u201cSo, where am I going to keep all the Adoration assets? My clothing and books I can keep in the car or somebody\u2019s house but where will I keep these assets that I have given to the Catholic Church of Enugu? But I say may God take the glory and whoever that has offended me, I have forgiven.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fight anybody or even dream of battling anybody. If anybody allows the devil to use him, the same that advised you to make a mistake will laugh at you when you cry over the error. The baby is born, there is no going back.\n\n\u201cWe are moving out. We have been doing it and we will do it again.\u201d\n\nActually, many had thought that heavens would fall over the transfer. The manner the whole thing died down attracted the envy of former Vice President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop John Praise Daniel who extolled the legendary discipline in the orthodox Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cI know if it were in a Pentecostal church, a church would have started the following day. A man with over 30, 000 worshippers still agreed to leave everything to one small church. It\u2019s discipline,\u201d he had remarked.\n\nLife of giving\n\nIn early 2020, Fr. Mbaka shocked both his followers and non-followers alike when he disclosed that he spends about $2 million (over N700 million) monthly on charity works. The priest through his Multi-Live Savers for the Less Privileged has positively changed the lives of many indigent persons nationwide.\n\nDuring the event marking his 25th year of priestly ordination, one of his followers, Anita Ogonna, praised him saying: \u201cFr Mbaka, you are not a saint or the best among all, but I respect you so much in all your physical and spiritual doings, you are a man who converted his money for private jet to give many poor people a home, you converted your pomposity to give young people hope, you restored many even at the point of death. You did not consider your ministry as a competition with others. You are really a shadow of emulation, prophet of contentment, man of generosity, prophet of humility, prophet of the poor, one among the givers of our time\u201d.\n\nThe priest distributed over 4,000 bags of rice, condiments and clothes to less privileged members of the adoration family as part of his 2018 Christmas and New Year gifts.\n\nHaruna Ayuba who led a group of Northern Christians to the programme said: \u201cAll these good works and miracles of God through Fr Mbaka still confirm that in spite of all the attacks on him, the hand of God is still upon him and his ministry.\u201d\n\nHis many controversies\n\nMbaka is synonymous with controversies. From his frosty relationship with the then Governor of Enugu State, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani to the standoff with former President Goodluck Jonathan and then to the recent prophecy on the Imo State Governorship position, Mbaka\u2019s penchant for toeing paths other preachers would love to avoid could be clearly seen.\n\nNnamani was the first to taste the bitter pill from Mbaka. It was a tough eight years for the governor, as he found in Mbaka a man he could not handle. It was literally a battle of superiority between the two. Their friction got to its peak with the death of 14 worshippers following a stampede at the Adoration Ground; an incident Mbaka blamed on the then Governor. But Nnamani denied complicity in the incident and has continued to plead innocence till date.\n\nMbaka allegedly went ahead to prophesy that Nnamani would not win re-election in 2003. However, the governor won convincingly at the polls. He also contested and won a senatorial position in 2007 after serving his second term as governor.\n\nHis statements unarguably contributed to the failure of Chief Ikedi Ohakim to win re-election as governor of Imo State in 2011. The priest has since made up with the former governor.\n\nOn December 31, 2014, Mbaka shocked Nigerians, especially the entire South-East region as he prophesied against the re-election bid of the then President, Jonathan, whom he dubbed bad luck. In his New Year message for 2015, titled \u201cFrom good luck to bad luck,\u201d the priest tore the former president to shreds as he detailed his failure in tackling corruption and insecurity in the country.\n\nHe prophesied that the then opposition candidate, Buhari, would win at the polls. During the sermon at the Christ the King Catholic Parish, GRA, Enugu, Sunday, January 4, 2015, Mbaka said that he had been receiving threats.\n\n\u201cSurely, they shall gather, but because the gathering is not of God they shall scatter. No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper. They said Buhari gave me money, but I have never met with Buhari. I don\u2019t know him in person. I only delivered the message I was given and I stand by that message because the future of this country is bleak with Jonathan on the saddle,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the controversy raged; even many of Mbaka\u2019s staunch followers found it hard to accept it, with a lot of them suggesting that the priest had really dabbled into politics.\n\nOne of the celebrated attacks Mbaka received was a musical video by a local artiste known as BBC, titled: \u201cMbaka Why?\u201d The video further poured fuel into an already burning furnace. BBC went ahead to list a number of failed prophesies allegedly delivered by Mbaka and predicted that his prophecy against the president would fail likewise.\n\nMbaka\u2019s prophecy came to fruition as Jonathan was roundly defeated at the polls and the priest was vindicated.\n\nAnother controversial prophecy was the Imo State Governorship position which was at the time at the Supreme Court. The candidate of the PDP, Chief Emeka Ihedioha had won the election and was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) but Mbaka prophesied, even though Iheadioha had been sworn in as governor, that the candidate of the APC, Senator Hope Uzodimma would become governor of the state.\n\nMbaka advised those who might find the message unpalatable not to come after him, warning that such action would attract the wrath of the Holy Spirit upon such individuals.\n\n\u201cMany things are going to happen in Nigeria this 2020 that will shock countrymen and countrywomen; but all would be to God\u2019s glory. In spite of all that would happen this 2020, there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn Imo State, there is hope. Hope, hope, hope in Imo State! Imo people have suffered but God is raising a new hope that would be an agent of salvation for them. He\u2019s coming with a new flag to restore the dignity of that noble land.\n\n\u201cA new leadership that will break barriers and there would be joy in the land of Imo. Lift your candles as I bless Hope Uzodimma; and I empower him to, spiritually, to take over. How, I do not know.\n\n\u201cPlease, if you heard that there would be a new government in Imo and you don\u2019t like the message; if I say Hope, you can say hopeless but do not fight me.\n\n\u201cI am saying this in respect of those who may want to come after me because of the message. If you do that, the God of Moses, Elijah and Elisha will deal with you. I am only a messenger of God\u201d, he said.\n\nMany Nigerians, including priests, attacked Mbaka for making a prophecy that was at the time seen as impossible as they believed that Uzodimma did not even stand a chance even if Ihedioha should lose at the apex court.\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Imo State, and other religious leaders berated Mbaka over the prophecy insisting that it was politically motivated.\n\nAlso, the Imo State Chapter of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) in a statement in Owerri by its Chairman, Isidore Chukwuemeka, asked: \u201cWhere was Mbaka when Imo State was serially raped for eight years by a clueless administration that mindlessly looted the treasury of the state?\u201d\n\nEven after the prophecy was fulfilled, some people still continued their attack on Mbaka. Senior Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, Adewale Giwa said that he was not surprised to see the fulfilment of the prediction by Rev. Fr. Mbaka that Uzodimma would be declared Imo State Governor by the court as Mbaka was a partisan prophet, adding that he must have got the hint of the judgement before speaking.\n\nGiwa said: \u201cWhen a partisan prophet speaks, we surely know who gives him the hint. This is a concluded deal among them.\n\n\u201cIs it not the same prophet who enters Aso Rock, wining and dining with the President? We know where they all belong. Check my record, I stand by the truth at all times and the truth will eventually prevail in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMbaka later admitted that the prophecy was a risky one but cautioned people against attacking him or his prophesies. In a statement released weeks after Uzodimma was declared the substantive governor of Imo State.\n\n\u201cHelp me to correct the mendacious, heinous and horrendous impression given by the press over my relationship with my bishop. I have no problem with my bishop. Am I forgiving him for what? I didn\u2019t say that I have forgiven my bishop as they reported.\n\n\u201cI rather opined that I have forgiven all those who maligned me when I prophesied, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that Hope Uzodimma is going to be the governor of Imo state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary and secondary school, I had started seeing vision and doing mysterious things by God. Attacking me is a waste of time. That will not stop God in sending messages to me. So, you attackers, use your time and do meaningful something for yourself,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the wake of the crisis generated by Mbaka\u2019s prophecy, Bishop Callistus Onaga had instructed the Catholic faithful to disregard the prophecy.\n\nBut Mbaka had wondered why there was so much negative reaction to his Imo prophecy than when he prophesied late General Sani Abacha\u2019s death, late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death, as well as Buhari\u2019s take over from former President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cAll these came to pass, why is this one so catastrophic? Those who attacked me, who is now a loser? Is it you or me? Holy Spirit told me that Hope Uzodimma was going to become the governor of Imo State and I should obey God rather.\n\nHe cautioned the church and all those who were perturbed by his God\u2019s gift that they should know his gift did not just come when he became a priest.\n\nThe Catholic priest had on January 15, held the first thanksgiving for Uzodimma at the Adoration Ground, a day after the apex court sacked Ihedioha as governor.\n\nHis other controversies\n\nMbaka had described former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as Bureau de Change because of the mindboggling foreign currencies that reportedly exchanged hands at the last National Convention of the PDP in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, before he emerged the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2019 elections.\n\nRegardless, he warned him not to emulate Buhari if he was elected the president.\n\nMbaka stated that the President had all the human and materials resources at his disposal to make the country better but rather chose to play ethnic, despotic politics by surrounding himself with people without vision and not inclined to his line of thought. He noted that Buhari had wasted a golden opportunity offered him by God and by implication disobeyed God.\n\nHe also described the cost of the APC\u2019s expression of interest and nomination forms as outrageous; saying that if the leadership of the party had conscience, they would not have collected N24 million from people to obtain the forms. He added that a party with conscience would have returned the money to the aspirants instead of casting aspersions on them.\n\nAlthough Mbaka had predicted defeat for the ruling party in the elections but he said that there was still opportunity for change. He further warned Buhari that the \u201cprice of disobedience is disgrace.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if Atiku had the opportunity that the president has, he would have revamped Nigeria.\n\nEventually, when Buhari won the election, Mbaka said that Atiku had lost it in the spiritual realm the day he (Mbaka) apologised to his running mate, Obi.\n\nHe was to later celebrate President Buhari\u2019s victory in the Presidential polls on March 27; where he said that God had honoured his prophecy.\n\nMbaka said had the President lost in the polls, his ministry would have been closed down. \u201cBut our God is a humongous miracle. He has answered our prayers. I am happy. I am filled with joy. On this altar, we will decree and it will come to pass. Anybody I support will be victorious.\u201d\n\nHe declared that even if the Presidential polls were cancelled, Atiku and Obi would still lose a rerun because \u201cthe ways of God are not the ways of man. People should stop playing God\u201d.\n\nPrior to this period, the Human Rights Writers Association (HURIWA) had in January 2016, threatened to drag Mbaka to the Vatican following his prophecy on plots to kill Buhari. Leader of the group, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko had asked the Nigerian Catholic hierarchy to sanction the priest for abandoning his sacred vocation and deviating into the profane and mundane roadside career of high wire politics under the canopy of his Catholic\u2019s priestly vocation.\n\nVoice of the voiceless\n\nMbaka\u2019s closeness to Governor Ugwuanyi did not stop him from speaking out for the people as he openly decried the recent demolition of structures in Enugu by the Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority in its bid to restore the original master plan of the capital city.\n\nThe outspoken priest had described the action of the Enugu State Government as an atrocity against the people.\n\nAccording to him, the immensity of suffering and economic hardships in the country did not warrant the demolition of people\u2019s shops without giving them time, or providing alternative areas for them.\n\n\u201cIf you want to restore the master plan of 1933 in Enugu State, you should do it holistically. There are some areas where the master plan was flouted but because they belonged to the echelon political class, government is afraid of pulling the structures there down.\n\n\u201cWhat about Zoo Estate? The place that was made for animals\u2019 residence is now being harboured by human beings, so, you don\u2019t take justice one-sided; whoever errs must be punished. When I see you people destroying those ones, I now know that you are out to restore the original master plan of Enugu,\u201d Mbaka stated.\n\nMeanwhile mixed reactions have trailed the whole episode of his disappearance and reappearance. Former Federal Commissioner of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Executive Director of Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), blamed the diocesan bishop for allowing him the latitude of growing wings within the church.\n\nHe urged the Bishop of Enugu diocese to go ahead and close down the Adoration Ground, saying Mbaka should be defrocked and laicized if he became rebellious.\n\nOnwubiko said: \u201cI think the Bishop made a mistake to have allowed Rev Fr Mbaka to grow almost much bigger than his diocese by running his own ministry to the detriment of the core responsibilities for which he was ordained.\n\nIPOB seeks support for Mbaka\n\nMeanwhile, the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, in an audio broadcast has warned people from the South-East not to condemn the cleric.\n\nKanu reiterated that there are Nigerians like the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai who have grievous cases hanging on them, and appear to be sacred cows in Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cIn a normal country so to speak, the condemnation of Father Mbaka, you may welcome it somehow. I know sometimes regardless of our shortcomings, we are brutal in the way we think. We see what is bad and say it\u2019s bad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is doing it. That\u2019s why a lot of people came down heavily on Father Mbaka but I\u2019m telling you this, yes in Biafra, we can do anything we like to him. But, in Nigeria, as far as Nigeria is concerned, never ever condemn your own,\u201d Kanu said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld deregistration of 74 political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their inability to win any election after the 2019 general polls.\n\nJustice Adamu Jauro, who delivered the judgment of the apex court in a virtual court session on Friday, held that the deregistration of the affected political parties, including National Unity Party (NUP) was in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act. The judgment has to a large extent, sealed the fate of the remaining 73 parties many of whom have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. The Commission, which had on February 6, 2020, announced deregistration of the 74 political parties, hinged it on their failure to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitutional Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has determined that eighteen (18) political parties have fulfilled the requirements for an existence based on Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as follows,\u201d the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said. The Abuja division of the Federal High Court had in it\u2019s judgment, affirmed the power of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deregister political parties, which failed to comply with the provisions of the law particularly Section 225 A of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Justice Jauro, in his judgment delivered in the suit filed by the National Unity Party, one of the 74 parties deregistered by the INEC in February, affirmed that the constitutional power of the electoral commission and the reasons given by the Commission for deregistration of parties are valid, in conformity with the law, sacrosanct and could not be affected by the fact of anticipated Local government elections by some states, which dates were not fixed, certain or even ascertainable. The court, therefore, held that deregistration of National Unity Party as a political party in Nigeria was lawfully done in exercise of vested constitutional powers of the INEC in accordance with Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution. The judgment conclusively terminated the legal existence of the party and also all its other rights and obligations. With the ruling, all pending appeals by other deregistered parties are now an academic exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the judgment, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, hailed the judgment and said the judgment had ended all speculations and this will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.",

          "title": "How we spent $1bn to acquire weapons \u2013 Defence",
          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nThe Defence Ministry on Friday further gave an insight into how the controversial $1 billion released by President Muhammadu Buhari to procure arms was expended on the purpose for which it was released while waiting for the products\u2019 arrival about three years after.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Musa Istifanus, who stated this as a guest of honour at the Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) 2021 Summit in Kaduna, added that the procurement was made to address the security threats currently bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, those that were raising dust about the funds were doing so out of ignorance of how the funds were used for the purpose it was raised. He maintained that, \u201cthe Nigerian Government had spent N1 billion dollars in acquiring weapons for the war against the insurgency it is facing.\n\n\u201cSome ignorant people say that they have not seen any weapon. I know where the weapons are. They are yet to come. We paid $496millon to the American government and it is getting to three years now, the Super Tucanos are yet to arrive. Last week, we received an email that it will come on July 21\u201d, he said.\n\nTo DICON, he said, \u201cmanpower development which you identified as one of the key points that encompasses training, is key to the success of DICON, especially where you will want to use research and development to chart the course of your success.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and the Ministry of Defence looks forward to seeing DICON attain a highly productive and profitable cooperation in our collective national desire to attain self-reliance and self-sufficiency in our defence and security needs,\u201d he said\n\nEarlier, the Executive Vice Chairman of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), Prof M S Haruna, who was represented at the event by Dr Ibrahim Onuwo Abdulmalik, called on business giants like Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola and others to support the Nigerian Industrial Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) for the security of their investments.\n\n\u201cIf we have the richest man in Africa on Nigerian soil, and he\u2019s not supporting DICON, maybe, we are not even talking to him. We are not talking to Dangote; we are not talking to Otedola and the rest of them.

          "title": "For Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi and Hadiza Bala-Usman, It\u2019s Personal",
          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe suspension of Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority last Thursday by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, against civil service rules for the removal of heads of MDAs, was the culmination of the personal desire of the minister to remove Hadiza and truncate her second term as Managing Director of agency.\n\nHadiza was not told what her offences were or formally communicated, before her suspension was announced by the presidency.\n\nNot querying her or making her aware of her offence(s) before suspending her is a clear breach of the processes stipulated in the government\u2019s own regulation for disciplining heads of government agencies. A government circular dated May 19, 2020, and endorsed by the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, stipulated that when there is an issue of impropriety against the head of an agency, the federal government requires a minister, through the permanent secretary of the supervising ministry, to refer the matter to the governing board of the affected agency in line with its enabling law and chapters three and 16 of the Public Service Rules on discipline in government parastatals.\n\nThe board will then issue the affected official a query and subsequently advise the minister of its findings and recommendations. But if the board itself is the source of the allegation of misconduct against the chief executive or the chief executive is the chairman of the board, the minister, on the advice of the permanent secretary, still has to ensure a query is issued, requesting an explanation from the accused official.\n\nIn this case, neither the governing board nor the SGF was carried along before action was taking against Hadiza.\n\nIn the beginning, it was all well between Amaechi and Hadiza, who closely worked together when the minister was DG of the Buhari campaign and Hadiza was a close confidant of candidate Buhari, resulting in Amaechi recommending her as MD of NPA. When Amaechi became transport minister, things began to degenerate when he found Hadiza too independent to rein her in or control and the suspended MD would not serve in his court full of political courtiers.\n\nThings came to a head when Amaechi wanted to renew all dredging contractors of NPA. Many of the contractors had served for decades and Amaechi got Hadiza to cancel her public advertisement for bid but was later overruled by the BPE, acting on the orders of the president that a public bid be held.\n\nThe crisis deepened from one contract to the other as Hadiza insisted on due process and more often had presidential backing to the anger of Amaechi, who then promised that Hadiza would be a one term MD. To the minister\u2019s shock and consternation, Hadiza got a second term without his input and since then vowed to oust her.\n\nThe first attempt was when Amaechi accused Hadiza and the NPA of not auditing their books and recommended KPMG Nigeria; Deloitte Nigeria; Price Water House Coopers, Ernst and Young and Mckinsey and Company Nigeria. The Auditor-General of the Federation informed Amaechi that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe Auditor General of the Federation also told the minister that the NPA was in compliance with yearly audit unlike other government agencies.\n\nFrom that, the crisis culminated into the issue over remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds between 2016 and 2020 to Consolidated Revenue Funds (CRF) and the CBN.\n\nBefore Hadiza could respond to the query to show that NPA had indeed been remitting to the CRF and the CBN, Amaechi got the President to approve her ouster without due process on the pretext that a panel had been set up to probe her management of then agency. Ironically, the person to act for her while on suspension is the Executive Director, Finance of NPA, Mohammed Koko, who was not suspended, despite the planned probe of NPA\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Minister alleged that the NPA under Hadiza could not account for N165.320 billion between 2018 and 2020 in the record of its remittance of operations surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds. Amaechi in a letter addressed to the office of the President on March this year, alleged that NPA\u2019s yearly remittance of operating surpluses from year 2016-2020 fell short of the actual amount due for actual remittance.\n\nAmaechi wrote: \u201cIn view of the above, I wish to suggest that the financial account of the activities of Nigerian Ports Authority be investigated for the period 2016-2020 to ascertain the true financial position and the outstanding unremitted balance of One hundred and sixty-five billion, three hundred and twenty million, nine hundred and sixty-two thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven naira only (N165,320,962,697).\u201d\n\nThe minister therefore sought that \u201cthe account and remittance of NPA in the period of 2018-2020 be audited to account for the gross shortfall of remitted public funds.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency, in a letter dated March 30, and which was signed by the Chief of Staff to the President granted the prayers of the Transport Minister on the need to audit the books of NPA\n\nHowever, there was a drama as the office of the Auditor General of the Federation clarified that the NPA Act did not give anyone the responsibility of authorising the Auditor General of the Federation to audit its accounts. It however explained that it is within the purview of the office of the Auditor General of the Federation to provide NPA with a list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors, among others.\n\nIn the memo signed by the Auditor-General of the Federation, the Transport Minister was informed that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe memo also said that both firms had audited and published the audited accounts of NPA as approved by the board for 2016, 2017 and 2018, adding that the audit of 2019 was ongoing, awaiting NPA\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the position of the AGF, Amaechi, through a memo issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Magdalene Ajani and addressed to the Auditor-General of the Federation, called for a holistic audit of all financial activities of the NPA and went further to list some selected audit firms for the job.\n\nThose familiar with the crisis said it has been a cat and mouse relationship between the Minister and the embattled chief executive of NPA, for over five years climaxing in the rejection of the record of NPA\u2019s remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the CRF.\n\nThe cat and mouse relationship between Amaechi and Hadiza was also fuelled by the suspicion that the executive director was too close to the supervising minister, a development that was said to have raised the fear that the director had been leaking some sensitive information especially of the finances of NPA to the Minister.\n\nKoko is known to be close to Amaechi in his days as governor of Rivers State. Koko was then a staff of Zenith Bank in Port Harcourt.\n\nThere was also the battle over the sack of Intels, a major contractor of NPA by Bala-Usman. The firm was a major sponsor of APC in the 2015 election and the transport minister was looking towards the firm for support in 2023. Amaechi wanted Intels badly but Hadiza denied him.\n\nPolitical Tweets\n\nBala-Usman finally played into the hands of those plotting her ouster with her recent political tweet on the state of the nation.\n\nReacting to the rising insecurity in the country, Hadiza on February 27, tweeted, \u201cThe state of insecurity in the country that has led to the kidnap of Kagara boys and Zamfara girls need to be addressed urgently\u2026We can\u2019t go on like this! Rescue our children and secure our country that\u2019s all we ask\u2026#SecureNorth #SecureNigeria.\u201d\n\nThe tweets caught the attention of her opponents who intensified moves to remove her for daring to take on a government which she served.\n\nPresident Buhari and her other sympathisers in the Presidency could no longer help her case when attention were called to the tweet which presented her as a sharp critic of the administration, who could no longer be trusted because of the suspicion that she might be working for the opposition.\n\nBala-Usman\u2019s last-Minute Efforts\n\nHowever, Bala-Usman, who got wind of the plot against her, had on Wednesday fired a memo addressed to the Chief of Staff to the President, stating her position and calling for involvement of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation to establish the true position of the authorities\u2019 remittances.\n\nIn the memo she personally signed, Bala-Usman explained that the Authority\u2019s computation of its remittances to the CFR are concluded arising from numbers from the audited financial statements using the template forwarded to the authority from the Fiscal Responsibility Commission and not budgetary provision.\n\nShe insisted that the NPA has remitted the full amount due it to CFR for the periods 2017 and 2018 arising from the operating surplus derived from the audited financial statement for the period totalling N76.384 billion as evidenced in treasury receipts.\n\nAccording to her, NPA had remitted a total of N82.687billion for the period 2019 and 2020 pending the audit of the financial statement at which point the amount so much computed arising from the value of the operating surplus to the audited financial statement will be remitted to the CFR.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that the Chief of Staff requests the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation who are the statutorily custodian of status of payment to the CRF to provide clartrue position of the Authorities remittances to the CFR,\u201d she submitted.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, pundits are wondering if President Buhari will discard his adopted daughter for an unreliable former governor of Rivers State who ditched his predecessor Peter Odili and not on speaking terms with his successor, Nyesom Wike.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says sack of 74 parties complied with extant provisions of Constitution, Electoral Act\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria yesterday put a final lid on the prospect of reinstating the 74 political parties deregistered by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for failure to win any elective position in the 2019 general election, when it ruled that the deregistration of one of the affected parties, National Unity Party (NUP), is constitutional.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous judgment delivered virtually by Justice Chima Nweze upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal which had earlier affirmed the deregistration of the NUP.\n\nBy this action, the apex court has sealed the fate of the remaining 73 deregistered parties, many of which have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.\n\nThe NUP had challenged its deregistration by INEC in line with the laws and in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act.\n\nIt noted that INEC \u201chas the legal power\u201d to deregister the affected political party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, by affirming the concurrent findings of the lower courts on the NUP case, has upheld not only the powers of INEC to deregister political parties, but also that the process and procedure adopted for the deregistration of the 74 political parties was in compliance with extant laws.\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement yesterday, INEC was faced with multiple cases by the deregistered political parties, with the courts giving conflicting judgements.\n\nIn one of such cases by some of the 74 deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja, had in a judgment delivered on July 29, 2020, affirmed the powers of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nThe appellate court in a unanimous decision presented by Justice Mohammed Idris, held that INEC acted within the constitutional provisions, as well as the Electoral Act in sacking the political parties, which failed to win a single office in the last general election.\n\nConsequently, the Court of Appeal nullified and set aside the judgment of Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier nullified INEC\u2019s deregistration of the political parties on the grounds that the deregistration breached Section 225(a) of the Constitution. The affected parties headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe said constitutional provision -Section 225(a) \u2013 spells out the minimum election victory a party must record or percentage of votes it must poll to sustain its status as a registered political party.\n\nIn another case by some other deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, ordered the commission to re-list 22 of the political parties deregistered for failing to win any elective office in the 2019 general election.\n\nThe court made the order shortly after setting aside a judgment of the Federal High Court, which upheld the power of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nJustice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, in a judgment delivered on June 11, 2020 had dismissed the suit of the 22 appellants challenging the power of INEC to deregister them.\n\nReacting to yesterday\u2019s ruling, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council, Dr. Leonard Nzenwa hailed the judgment, saying it had ended all speculations and that \u201cthis will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomole, has described the call for military takeover of a democratically elected government as irresponsible and senseless.\n\nOshiomhole\u2019s reaction followed a recent call by legal luminary, Chief Roberts Clarke, in an interview on television, for military intervention in governance in order to fix the country\u2019s festering security challenges and to carry out restructuring of the country.\n\nThe former national Chairman of APC spoke yesterday in Abuja when the leadership of the Law Students Association of Nigeria (LAWSON), paid him a courtesy visit, during which they invited him to their forthcoming National Conference on Rule of Law.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI watched on a national television one of your very senior colleagues, Chief Robert Clarke, I was shocked when I saw him calling on the President to handover to the military.\n\n\u201cI thought that was the height of irresponsibility, given his knowledge, given his age and a very senior member of the bar and, what is it that he wanted? He wants a military that will restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is again for me senseless, because the structure as it is today, who put it in place? Who overthrew the parliamentary system?\u201d\n\nThe former Edo State Governor was of the opinion that the first thing that suffers under the military is the rule of law, adding that for anyone who is familiar with the military system, like Clarke, should tender apology to Nigerians.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe parliamentary system was overthrown by the Nigerian military. That is on record. Who created 12 states from the four regions by decree? It was the military. The current 36 states and FCT; who created them by military decree? It was the military. How can anybody who has lived through and who is familiar with our journey as a nation think that the solution to our problems as a nation is to handover to the military? I think, talking about the rule of law, that is treason.\n\n\u201cYou know we have freedom of speech but it does not include the freedom to canvass unlawful means to effect a change. When you canvas unlawful means, then you should be arraigned before a court of law and dealt with according to the law. Ignorance is not even an excuse in law, not to talk of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOshiomhole called on Nigerians to have faith in the country in spite of the challenges, while urging everyone not to give up.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that even in our moment of distress and regardless of what anybody thinks, the world has resolved and Nigeria is part of it, that never again shall we be governed by an unelected government, never, we don\u2019t want unelected Angels.\u201d\n\nOn the agitation for separation, the APC chieftain described those agitating for secession as \u201cpoor students of history\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am also not agreeing with those who think of dis-membering Nigeria. They say let everybody go his way. Nigeria is not a reality. Those ones are poor students of history.\n\n\u201cWhy is Europe spending so much time forming the European Union to create a larger market? Recently, we signed the African Trade Agreement so that Nigeria can access a bigger market. We already have a local market of 200 million. If we can keep it flourishing and increase the purchasing power of the citizens, we already have a huge market. That should be an asset.

          "text": "\u2022Raised red flags snubbed by US bank\u2019s management\n\nFestus Akanbi and Emmanuel Addeh, with agency report\n\nFresh documents on the long-standing legal dispute between the federal government and Malabu Oil have shown that JP Morgan, the American bank in the middle of the alleged scandal, was alerted by its internal control team that the $875 million transfers to former petroleum minister Dan Etete, for the sale of OPL 245, were questionable.\n\nEtete, who was minister under the Sani Abacha regime, has been in the eye of the storm concerning the sale of the oil block which triggered a number of court cases in Nigeria and in Europe.\n\nA report yesterday by Bloomberg indicated that JPMorgan Chase & Co. was warned by its compliance team over the \u201cgreat risk\u201d of corruption just days before it made the last of three transfers that totalled $875 million to Etete.\n\nThe federal government, in a London lawsuit, is pushing that the internal memo sent by the compliance unit to the bank\u2019s managers should be scrutinised.\n\nThe U.S. bank is accused of ignoring the red flags when it transferred funds between 2011 and 2013 to Dan Etete, whose private jet was seized by the Buhari government.\n\nThe memo disclosed at a London court hearing last Wednesday showed what JPMorgan managers knew about the oil contract and when, lawyers for the Nigerian government said in court documents. A spokesperson for the investment bank declined to comment.\n\nAccording to court documents, by 2013, JPMorgan\u2019s internal concerns over payments to Malabu Oil and Gas were escalated to more senior members of the bank.\n\n\u201cIn light of Malabu\u2019s reported connection to the alleged Nigerian corruption scheme, there would be great risk presented if JPMC continues to process wires involving Malabu,\u201d a compliance officer based in the United States wrote in a memo dated Aug. 23, 2013 and quoted by Bloomberg.\n\nJust six days later, JPMorgan made a payment of $75.2 million to the Malabu account, according to the report.\n\nLawyers for the federal government said in court last Wednesday that they wanted to know how the memo was compiled and asked a judge for more emails and documents from the compliance team.\n\nThe lawyers are seeking details of how the US bank\u2019s compliance team monitored and placed controls over questionable payments including a so-called \u201cinterdiction list\u201d, a tool to prevent transfers from being automatically cleared. Malabu was placed on the list in November 2013.\n\nThe federal government had alleged that most of the $1.3 billion purchase price for the licence for the offshore oilfield known as OPL 245 was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen under previous administrations.\n\nIn 1998, the government awarded OPL 245 for $20 million to Malabu Oil and Gas, which was later found to be owned by Dan Etete, who was oil minister at the time, in collaboration with people close to former military ruler, Sani Abacha.\n\nThree years later, in July 2001, the then government under President Olusegun Obasanjo revoked OPL 245 licence, triggering legal disputes over its ownership that dragged on for years.\n\nBy 2006, Malabu reached a settlement with the federal government, agreeing to pay $218 million to Nigeria in return for the licence being fully reinstated, after it was given to Shell, which subsequently failed to pay.\n\nThe case became even more complex when Mohammed Abacha, son of the former ruler, launched a legal challenge arguing that Etete pushed him out of his partial ownership of Malabu.\n\nIn 2011, Malabu agreed to hand OPL 245 back to the government for $1.092 billion. In parallel, Shell and Eni agreed to pay the government $1.092 billion plus a signature bonus of $208 million, taking their payment for OPL 245 to $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the same year, $1.092 billion was placed in an escrow account opened by the Nigerian government with U.S. bank JP Morgan, from which $875 million was transferred to bank accounts in the name of Malabu.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria filed a case at a London High Court against the bank alleging negligence for its role in transferring the $875 million to Etete\u2019s Malabu, an allegation JP Morgan said it considered \u201cunsubstantiated and without merit\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, a Nigerian judge issued arrest warrants for Dan Etete, and an Eni manager over the sale of the oilfield.\n\nEuropean and Nigerian courts have been raking over the purchase by Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc of the oil license in Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, a decade ago.\n\nWhile the energy giants were recently acquitted of corruption charges in Milan, in a decision prosecutors could appeal, Nigeria\u2019s government is continuing to seek compensation from JPMorgan.\n\nThe Buhari administration claims Etete distributed a portion of the funds received via the bank from the oil majors to corrupt former and serving senior public officials.\n\nThe bank has denied any wrongdoing and says it is being held responsible for not protecting the Nigerian people from their own government.\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s oil minister in the last weeks of the corrupt Abacha military regime in 1998, Etete was said to have effectively awarded the prospecting rights of the huge OPL 245 block to the company he secretly controlled.\n\nAfter Abacha\u2019s sudden death, Etete retained the rights as a private citizen until he offloaded them to oil giants Shell and Eni in 2011, and they paid a combined $1.3 billion to the federal government.\n\nThe entire OPL245 deal was a subject of a corruption trial in Italy, where Etete was an accused, together with alleged middlemen, Eni and Shell, and several of their executives. The court recently acquitted the international oil executives.\n\nThe Nigerian authorities had also charged Etete and several others linked to Malabu with money laundering in connection with the onward flow of funds from the OPL245 deal.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the allegations as \u201cpolitical propaganda.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has written an open letter to the United States President, Joe Biden, asking him not to sell weapons or ammunition to Nigeria because of the several instances of mass killings and ethnoreligious violence under the Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nKanu added that the transfer of weapons or sales to the present Nigerian government would mean more attacks on the Christians, which goes against the \"Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden\n\nThe letter is dated May 1, 2021, and titled, \"Re: Request for US Military Assistance By President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria.\"\n\nIn the letter obtained by SaharaReporters, the IPOB leader said, \"President Buhari has made Nigeria the most dangerous country in the world for Christians, Jews and Nigeria's indigenous peoples, particularly those of the former Republic of Biafra. Hundreds of thousands are routinely plundered, tortured or killed with impunity by Nigerian security forces controlled and populated by Buhari's Fulani Islamic tribesmen, often in collaboration with Fulani herdsmen (Islamist terrorist group that has been internationally branded the 4th deadliest terrorist grouping in the world).\n\n\"These atrocities have been confirmed and published by US State Department in its various Human Rights Reports on Nigeria, by Amnesty International and other credible bodies. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom has recommended listing Nigeria as a country of concern because of its religious oppressions. United States sales or transfers of weapons to Nigeria to fight Boko Haram are diverted to killing and terrorising Christians and Jews.\n\n\"President Buhari is promoting radical Islam in secular Nigeria. He has endorsed Sharia law in twelve northern Nigerian states. He has treated Boko Haram with kid gloves, releasing from detention hundreds arrested by the previous administration.\n\n\"He recruited them into the Nigerian army and offered a generous foreign scholarship to hundreds of them. He has appointed radical Muslims to head every security agency in Nigeria, including Sheik Isa Pantami, whose profuse support for Al Qaeda and Taliban was widely published recently. Yet, Mr Buhari has refused to sack him from his sensitive position as Minister of Communication overseeing the biometric data of Nigerians. By defending Sheik Pantami, Mr Buhari is seemingly aligning with Mr Pantami's terrorist sympathies. Mr Buhari is a strong ally of the Islamic Republic of Iran and China, and he has generally pursued policies that put Nigeria at odds with US national interest since you came to office.\"\n\nKanu said his prayers include that \"we respectfully suggest that you consider, among other things, denying weapons sales or transfers to Nigeria under the Leahy Amendment; listing Nigeria complicit in persecuting Christian and Jews under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.\n\n\"We respectfully urge the President to invoke Section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) particularly, as amended, which prohibits the furnishing of assistance authorised by the FAA and the Arms Export Control Act to any foreign security force unit where there is credible information that the unit has committed a gross violation of human rights.\"",

Some got turned down. Majority never responded. I won't mention names to protect identity, after all, they owe me nothing. I wrote to the our VC via the registrar who said they hardly sent lecturers abroad, Advertisement \u2014 Adetunji Adeniran (@kingadetunji_) May 5, 2021\n\nThe entrepreneur said he eventually got his visa after his friends helped him with N30,000, adding that his travel was also approved by the German embassy, leaving him with how to get money for his flight ticket.\n\nHe said it was while pondering on the situation that the idea of visiting some airlines to see if he could use one of the unoccupied seats for his travel struck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne day while surfing the internet at Faj Cafe in OAU, an idea struck. When airlines travel out of Nigeria, they definitely should have empty seats. Not every time the seats are always full. Why can\u2019t one of the airlines give me one of these empty seats to support my travel?\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdeniran said he had written proposals to different airlines but got rejected by some of them while others ignored his request.\n\nHe noted that amid the rejections, he had decided to try Lufthansa, which is a German airline.\n\nAdeniran said he had sent his proposal to Adenike Macaulay, the company\u2019s marketing head at the time, but got no response two weeks after.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe businessman said he, therefore, decided to brace the odds and visit the airline\u2019s office in Lagos with his last N10,000 to meet Macaulay, who is now the company\u2019s general manager of sales.\n\nHe said to his surprise, he was told that his proposal was accepted and was given some documents to fill in to finalise the process.\n\nBehold, the airline not only offered me a free return seat to Frankfurt, they also gave me a free train ticket from Frankfurt to Cologne. This was how I became the only African sponsored by an airline to the World Business Dialogue. Advertisement \u2014 Adetunji Adeniran (@kingadetunji_) May 5, 2021\n\nHe added that he was shocked that the airline did not only offer him a free return seat to Frankfurt but also a free train ticket from Frankfurt to Cologne.\n\n\u201cBehold, the airline not only offered me a free return seat to Frankfurt, they also gave me a free train ticket from Frankfurt to Cologne.

          "text": "Nigerian youths on Twitter are the best fans anyone can have. They will support one on unimaginative pedestals and fan the flame of one\u2019s moderate success till it appears as though it\u2019s an inferno. They will also frustrate one\u2019s perceived detractors with endless tweets of \u201cE choke,\u201d encourage one\u2019s efforts with \u201cKo po ke,\u201d and even \u201cstan\u201d to the level of obsession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut make no mistake, they are just as fierce when one falls in the crosshairs of their fury. If they are against you, they will do everything to drag you to the mud.\n\nThis may include twisting the meanings of all of one\u2019s tweets or blaming the person for everything that goes wrong \u2014 even when such has nothing to do with them.\n\nDesmond Elliot\u2019s instance is a glaring example of having Nigeria\u2019s Twitter mob in the opposition camp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past few months, the lawmaker representing Surulere at the Lagos state house of assembly has been getting constant flakes from Nigerian youths on Twitter. From being accused of causing the divorce of Bill and Melinda Gates as well as facilitating Davido and Chioma\u2019s seemingly crumbling relationship; Elliot has become Twitter Nigeria\u2019s number one scapegoat.\n\nIn April, the actor-turned-politician took to his Facebook page to acknowledge the fact that he\u2019s being blamed for everything on Twitter with a post that read: \u201cWetin dem talk say I do again\u201d.\n\nBut how did the once-revered movie star end up being the one person blamed for the wrongdoings, mistakes, or faults of others on the microblogging platform?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a product of Godfatherism\u201d\n\nThe meltdown started in September 2020 before the Edo gubernatorial election.\n\nGodwin Obaseki, governor of the state, had decamped to the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to pursue his second term bid in office at the time.\n\nHe had launched \u201cEdo no be Lagos\u201d as his campaign mantra \u2014 referencing the perceived hegemony Bola Tinubu, a national leader of the APC, seemed to have in the southwest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObaseki was also determined to topple the influence of Adams Oshiomhole, a former governor of the state, after the pair fell out.\n\nElliot perceived this as an insult on the institute of governance of Lagos, plainly stating that \u201che is a product of godfatherism\u201d \u2014 to the chagrin of several Nigerian youths on Twitter.\n\n\u201cA godfather always tries to look after the interest of his people. I\u2019m a product of godfatherism but Tinubu has never for one day asked me to do something you know would be detrimental,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s progressive. So, let him (Obaseki) not castigate the whole thing. If not for godfatherism, would he be where he is today? My point isn\u2019t even about him; it\u2019s that I want to talk about my candidate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliot\u2019s comment had provoked a plethora of negative reactions on the microblogging platform with some users accusing him of \u201cdestroying the process that cemented the \u2018not too young to run\u2019 agenda.\u201d\n\n#EndSARS \u201cChildren\u201d\n\nObaseki eventually won the election and the controversy over the aforementioned drama dwindled. But shortly after, the ordeals of Nigerian youths at the hands of the now-disbanded special anti-robbery squad (SARS) operatives took centre stage and stirred nationwide protests.\n\nThe two-week-long demonstration took a severe dimension on October 20 when men of the Nigerian army shot at protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos. Violence erupted from there on, dealing the state several human and property casualties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the state assembly\u2019s first meeting after the turmoil, a video surfaced wherein Elliot, expected by many to back the young protesters, referred to those who reacted hysterically to the toll gate incident as \u201cchildren.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me first thank you for condemning the wanton killings and carnage that happened at Lekki. When I went through the comments, I could not believe it, Mr. Speaker. Curses, the abuses from children,\u201d he said in the video.\n\n\u201cAnd I asked myself, \u2018Is this Nigeria? What is going on? Children cursing. People having the effrontery to enter an Oba\u2019s palace and hold his staff of office? Culture is gone!\u201d\n\nThis had opened the floodgates of another round of backlashes for Elliot on social media while also deepening the cracks between the actor and Nigerian youths on Twitter.\n\nSupporting social media bill\n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the part of the video where the lawmaker called for regulation of social media.\n\n\u201cWe need to address certain things: Nigerian youth; social media; social influencers. These make the narrative that we\u2019re seeing today. Except we\u2019re joking with ourselves, social media has its negative impacts,\u201d he had said.\n\nThis had aroused widespread outrage on the microblogging platform with some youths accusing the actor of \u201chypocrisy\u201d. Elliot was also accused of attempting to destroy the platform that brought him into office in the first place.\n\nNigerians on Twitter thereafter dug out a video from 2015 wherein Elliot admitted that social media was instrumental to his emergence as a lawmaker.\n\nThey agreed \u201che\u2019s a leaf that has been mixed with soap for too long hence he\u2019s decomposed into the same.\u201d\n\nAlthough the lawmaker apologised for all \u201cthese sins,\u201d his apology has proven inadequate to mend the shattered relationship with the youths of the country.\n\nOne can\u2019t tell for how long \u201cI blame Desmond Elliot\u201d will follow anything unsavory on social media.\n\nThe lesson from the ongoing drama, however, is clear.\n\nWhen you have Nigerian youths on Twitter against you, they can make you feel like you\u2019re napping on a pillow of clouds or you\u2019re smeared all over in faeces.\n\nJust ask Elliot for his experience so far.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Enabled users can then pick one of the payments services offered.\n\nCurrently, the new feature supports Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo. Android users can also send payments through the recently expanded Spaces announced on Twitter\u2019s blog.\n\nAccording to the blog post, \u201cTip Jar is an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation on Twitter. This is a first step in our work to create new ways for people to receive and show support on Twitter \u2013 with money.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the platform has been devising ways to generate revenue following a $260 million drop from its revenue in Q4 2020. In the platform\u2019s Q4 2020 report, it reported revenue of $1.3 billion. In Q1 2021, the report read a total revenue of $1.04 billion.\n\nWhile the Tip Jar feature is to show support on Twitter, it might eventually be a source of revenue for Twitter\n\nIn February, we predicted that Twitter would explore a tipping feature among other non-ad related prospects to increase revenue. At the moment, the platform has introduced other features such as Super Follows and might introduce Undo Tweets.\n\nThough Twitter isn\u2019t taking any cut from Tip Jar now, it is likely to do so when the feature is available to more people.\n\nWhile some users like Austin Rief, Morning Brew CEO, are excited about the feature, some privacy issues have been raised. Rachel Tobac, a user who tested the feature, tweeted that the PayPal receipt contained the sender\u2019s address. However, Twitter support has taken action on the issue in a tweet that read, \u201cWe\u2019re updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.\u201d\n\nLimited to only journalists, creators, experts, and non-profits, Twitter promises that more people will be able to add Tip Jar to their profiles.\n\nHowever, it is not clear the criteria Twitter will use to identify users with access to the feature.

We have been in touch with the police headquarters and agreed that Edo State Government will intervene in upgrading and improving the training facility and make it available for training the policemen and other members of the security architecture in the State.\n\n\u201cWe are redesigning the security architecture for the state and it will enable us to have a permanent training facility for about five or six squads at a time, made up of fifty men in each squad.\n\n\u201cThey will be equipped with introductory training in security, intermediate and advanced training as well in different levels. It can\u2019t happen with the facility in a state of disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come in to do an evaluation and assessment ourselves. The clinic needs to be rehabilitated and re-equipped and the hostels need to be rebuilt and re-equipped for decent habitation. The classroom needs to be rebuilt and the training ground and the obstacles need to be upgraded and repaired,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor further noted that \u201cthe state government is concerned about the state of the security system and cannot leave it for the Federal Government alone. Security is everybody\u2019s concern and as a state government, we have decided to put our money where our mouth is and use what we have to try and solve our problem\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Police Commissioner said that \u201cas a Force, we are happy that this facility is going to be upgraded by the Edo State Government.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state. I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "text": "Since the beginning of the year, the management of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, have \u2018short-changed\u2019 their medical interns in the payment of their monthly remuneration, the students have said.\n\nThe graduate interns, who are not pleased with the development, responded by protesting for the past three weeks.\n\nThe affected medical interns include dieticians, radiographers, pharmacists, nurses, and physiotherapists.\n\nAccording to the standard pay slip obtained by our correspondent, intern pharmacists are entitled to a monthly pay of N128, 000; nurses and dieticians should get N99,000; @ radiographer is expected to take N127, 000 and physiotherapists should get the same.\n\nMedical interns in other hospitals across the country also confirmed this to our correspondent in separate interviews.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES, however, understands that the interns have been getting \u2018part-payments\u2019 of their entitlements from January till date.\n\nInterns\u2019 ordeals\n\nFolashade Hamzat, an intern pharmacist who narrated her ordeal to PREMIUM TIMES, said UCH authorities have failed to address their plight despite repeated appeals.\n\n\u201cAll is not well with medical interns at UCH following the wicked actions of the management,\u201d said Ms Hamzat.\n\n\u201cThey have been deducting our salary since January and this is not happening in other hospitals. In January, we got N74,000, we got N81,000 for February. We were paid N39,000 in March and they paid N69,000 April. We are not happy with this because we are being cheated.\n\n\u201cAmidst of this, I was tested positive for COVID-19 and nothing from the authority to even appreciate our efforts. The reward for hardwork in UCH is reduction of one\u2019s entitlement.\u201d\n\nAlso, an intern physiotherapist, Ezekiel Andrew, said: \u201csince the beginning of this year, salaries have been epileptic and it is a sad thing for us here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey paid us January and February half payment towards the ending of March. We just received alerts for March and April earlier this week and what we got was not even up to half of salary.\u201d\n\nA nurse intern, who did not want to be named for fear of being victimised, told PREMIUM TIMES that authorities have shown no concern to their plights.\n\n\u201cThey are not considering us. Our colleagues are not being treated like this in other hospitals. We are crying for help so that this cheating would stop.\u201d\n\nAfter repeatedly expressing their displeasures, the interns launched a hashtag, #PayUCHinterns on Twitter, yet no result.\n\nActions, inactions\n\nAfter weeks of protests, the management of UCH in a letter dated April 26, to all heads of department \u201cappealed to intern officers and contract staff in the Hospital for the shortfall in their monthly remunerations for the months of January, February and March, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe management in the letter signed by its Director of Administration, S.O.Oladejo, said the shortfall \u201cis as a result of the inadequate funds released for personnel remuneration in comparison with the actual number of Intern Officers and Contract Staff in the Hospital, thus making it impossible to fully pay up the remuneration of these categories of staff for the months of January-March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Management deeply understands the discomfort that this brings to the concerned members of staff to which end, efforts are being intensified to ensure that adequate funds are released to complete the payment of these personnel for the said months and to avert the recurrence of this situation in the future.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018Not satisfied, threatened\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the interns, PREMIUM TIMES learnt did not welcome the defence of the management as they continued with their agitation for full payments like their other colleagues in other hospitals across the country.\n\nA meeting was later held with the management team on May 4 but this ended in a stalemate as the interns proceeded with their protests.\n\nRather than pacify the medical interns, UCH\u2019s Director of Pharmaceutical Services, Adeyinka Ishola, who was \u201cnot pleased with their agitations\u201d reportedly threatened the health workers with sanctions via a 13-minute audio message PREMIUM TIMES is yet to authenticate.\n\n\u2018Why we are paying half salary\u2019\n\nPREMIUM TIMES on Saturday morning spoke with the spokesperson of the hospital, Toye Akinrinola, on why the interns are being denied their full salaries.\n\n\u201cThe interns before now are not on IPPIS but the problem started when they got them enrolled on it like every federal government staff. The problem is that what the government is sending is not enough to cater for the interns.\n\n\u201cWe are not oblivious of the fact that we are owing them. We will take every measure to ensure that we cater for their welfare. It is just a matter of time,\u201d he told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nAsked why the interns were \u2018threatened\u2019, he simply responded saying: \u201cthey are our children. We are appealing to them and we plead they understand.\u201d",

          "title": "Fitch affirms FBN Holdings\u2019 Ratings at \u2018B-\u2018/Negative after board removal by CBN",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nInternational ratings agency, Fitch, has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) and its primary operating subsidiary, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd (FBN), at \u2018B-\u2018 with a Negative Outlook, after the change of the bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe affirmation, Fitch said in an article on Friday, reflects is view that the impact of the CBN replacement of FBNH and FBN\u2019s boards, the identification of corporate governance failings and the imposition of corrective measures are tolerable at the rating level.\n\n\u201cWe have assessed the near-term financial impact of these actions on FBNH and FBN and believe this is tolerable at the rating level, even though the final outcome is uncertain. In our view, any remedial actions imposed by the CBN, including a potential reclassification of related-party exposures as impaired, will not have a material effect on the group\u2019s asset quality, profitability and capitalisation,\u201d Fitch said in the article published on its website.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not consider any possible additional actions by the CBN, especially if FBN fails to implement the regulator\u2019s corrective measures or if there were any further uncovering of corporate governance irregularities.\u201d\n\nFitch said, the Outlook remains Negative, reflecting FBNH\u2019s pre-existing asset quality and capitalisation weaknesses as well as the group\u2019s corporate governance weaknesses highlighted by the CBN. These could put pressure on the ratings.\n\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nAccording to Fitch, FBNH is the non-operating holding company that owns FBN. FBNH\u2019s ratings are aligned with those of FBN (which represents around 90% of consolidated group assets) due to high capital and liquidity fungibility within the group, and low double leverage (at 95% at end-1H20) at the holding company level.\n\nFBNH\u2019s IDR is driven by its intrinsic creditworthiness, as defined by its \u2018b-\u2018 Viability Rating (VR). The rating considers the group\u2019s exposure to Nigeria\u2019s volatile operating environment and also factors in vulnerability in its capital position in the context of moderate earnings generation and asset-quality pressures, where headroom above the minimum regulatory capital requirements is also moderate. Capitalisation is a factor of high importance to the VR.\n\nThe new boards appointed to FBNH and FBN comprise individuals with sufficient experience and expertise. However, we view such major change as hugely disruptive. There are no changes in FBNH and FBN\u2019s executive management team.\n\nWe believe the governance shortcomings cited by the CBN reflect poorly on FBNH\u2019s reputation and on the group\u2019s governance and control practices. As a result, we have revised down our assessment of FBNH\u2019s Management and Strategy score to \u2018b-\u2018 from \u2018b\u2019.\n\nWe also assigned a negative outlook to this factor, which reflects the uncertainty surrounding additional remedial actions that the CBN may impose due to these related party exposures as well as the potential for further uncovering of governance irregularities. It also captures the lack of track record of the new board and its ability to restore confidence in FBNH and FBN.\n\nAsset quality remains a rating weakness. FBNH reported an improved impaired loan ratio of 7.9% at end-1Q21 (end-2020: 7.7%). However, FBNH\u2019s reported reserve coverage of 54.5% at end-1Q21 (end-2020: 48%) remains significantly weaker than domestic peers\u2019. Our assessment indicates that if the related-party loan highlighted by the CBN were classified as impaired, the ratio would be unlikely to be above 10% (excluding any new impaired loan generation from ordinary business).\n\nCapitalisation remains a rating weakness and has a high influence on the ratings. FBN reported a capital adequacy ratio of 16.6% at end-1Q21 (excluding interim profits), which provides limited headroom above its 15% minimum regulatory requirement. In addition, FBNH\u2019s capitalisation metrics remain vulnerable to asset-quality risks given significant capital encumbrance by unreserved impaired loans.\n\nFBNH\u2019s profitability metrics typically lag behind those of the other large banks, mainly due to high loan impairment charges. In our view, the corrective measures, including higher provisioning on related-party loans or the sale of \u2018non-permissible\u2019 equity investments, would not materially affect profitability in the near term.\n\nOur conversations with FBNH give us to understand there has been no adverse effect from recent events on its funding and liquidity profile, which remains healthy. FBNH\u2019s funding profile continues to benefit from a substantial customer deposit base, which provides around 75% of its non-equity funding.\n\nSENIOR DEBT\n\nFBN\u2019s senior debt issued by FBN Finance Company BV is rated in line with the bank\u2019s Long-Term IDR, as the notes ultimately represent unconditional, senior unsecured obligations of the bank, which rank pari passu with its other senior unsecured obligations.\n\nUnless otherwise stated above, the key drivers of FBNH\u2019s other ratings and the ratings of its subsidiaries are in line with our most recent Rating Action Commentary (See \u201cFitch Affirms FBN Holdings Plc at \u2018B-\u2018; off RWN; Outlook Negative\u201d published on 5 October 2020).\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\nThe ratings of FBNH would be downgraded if the corporate governance shortcomings highlighted by the CBN persist and if any further weaknesses are uncovered, potentially leading to a greater financial impact.\n\nReputational repercussions that would make it harder for FBNH to meet its pre-tax profit growth ambitions, or significant adjustments to the group\u2019s management and strategy, could also contribute to rating pressure.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\nUpside to the ratings is unlikely at present.\n\nBEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from \u2018AAA\u2019 to \u2018D\u2019. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.",

When President Muhammad was contesting we thought the Nation\u2019s messiah was coming to liberate the country not knowing he would compound the problems already on ground.\u201d\n\nHe said the Nigerian leaders have failed in thier leadership responsibilities, this according to him had led to varieties of crises currently bedeviling the country.\n\nHe cited problem of insecurity, bad economy, unemployment among the youths, among others issues, urging the people of the country to go back to God and seek His intervention.\n\nThe renowned Islamic Scholar , however, commended Governor of Osun, Mr Gboyega Oyetola for his laudable achievements within the space of two years despite meager resources of the state .\n\nHe described the Governor as a silent achiever who he said had done tremendously well in the area of infrastructure, workers welfare among , provision of good health cares, good education policies among others.\n\nEchoing a similar view, Alhaji Adekilekun, who is the Chief Imam, Ansarudeen Muslim Society, Ede, said unconscionable acts of banditry, kidnapping and other forms of terrorism stem from poor governance.\n\n\u201cWe have enormous resources, human and natural. We have no business being where we are today as a nation. We have brilliant and patriotic Nigerians that can drive the process of the nation\u2019s renaissance, and they cut across the divide.\u201d\n\nAlhaji Adekilekun , however, urged parents on the need to take better responsibility of their children saying most of these issues are caused by bad youths who lack parental care while in their adolescent ages.\n\nSpeaking, the National Coordinator of Yoruba Progressive Forum, Alhaji Olalekan Lateef popularly known as Asiri Ede said that the maiden edition of annual Ramadan Lecture was organized in honour of the state Governor of Osun, Mr Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nLateef appreciated the guest lecturers and other invited guests who deemed it fit to attend the programme, Praying God to continue to provide for their needs.",

They just came and demolished our shops.\n\n\u201cWhile we were still complaining about our shops that were demolished, some hoodlums attacked us with daggers and other weapons and made away with our property.\n\n\u201cThey carried my washing machine, pressing iron and plastic buckets. They also carried my demolished container,\u201d he lamented.\n\nMadam Grace Abimbola, a seamstress, whose shop was also demolished, said that the hoodlums detached the roof of her shop and made away with her sewing machine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in pains. These \u2018maibola people\u2019 removed the roof of my shop and carried my sewing machine. We lost a lot of money.

          "text": "By Michael Adesina\n\nBenue State Governor Samuel Ortom has described Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna as a religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him.\n\nOrtom added that the Kaduna governor was one of the \u201cvery few persons\u201d who misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOrtom stated this on Saturday while reacting to the statement credited to El-Rufai, where the latter reportedly accused the Benue Governor of attacking the federal government to cover for his failure to secure Benue state.\n\nThe statement signed by Ortom\u2019s spokesman, Terver Akase, further said El-Rufai made such a comment to get back into the good books of the president.\n\nThe statement added that El-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to make such a comment owing to the insecurity and other challenges in Kaduna.\n\nPlease read Ortom\u2019s full statement on El-Rufai below:\n\nEL-RUFAI IS ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE MISLED PRESIDENT BUHARI\n\nWe read the statement credited to Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai in which he accused Governor Samuel Ortom of using the insecurity in his state to attack the Federal Government in order to cover up what he termed as the Benue State Governor\u2019s failure.\n\nWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\nA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launchpad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to the limelight.\n\nNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\nIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\n\nEl-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\nKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less that 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\nTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\nNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari. El-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\n\nNasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a Governor who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015?\n\nThe Kaduna Governor should know that only two days ago, the people of Benue State met at a stakeholders meeting in Makurdi and unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Ortom in recognition of his performance. That meeting was attended across party lines with leaders of All Progressives Congress, APC also present.\n\nEl-Rufai and his conspirators must note that Benue State will not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats they wage against Governor Ortom.\n\nWe advise the Kaduna State Governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace.\n\nTerver Akase\n\nChief Press Secretary\n\nMay 08, 2021.",

A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\nA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launchpad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to the limelight.\n\nNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\nIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\n\nEl-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\nKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less that 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\nTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\nNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari. El-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\n\nNasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a Governor who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015?\n\nThe Kaduna Governor should know that only two days ago, the people of Benue State met at a stakeholders meeting in Makurdi and unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Ortom in recognition of his performance. That meeting was attended across party lines with leaders of All Progressives Congress, APC also present.",

          "title": "How the US Locked Up Vaccine Materials Other Nations Urgently Need",
          "text": "To fight the pandemic at home, the United States gave its own vaccine manufacturers priority access to American-made materials needed to make the shots.\n\nAs a result, the US government laid claim not only to vast quantities of finished Covid-19 vaccines but also to vaccine components and equipment all along the supply chain, according to a Reuters review of more than a dozen contracts involving some major suppliers.\n\nThat has left some countries desperately in need of those supplies to scramble for substitutes, exacerbating international disparities in vaccine access, according to interviews with suppliers, foreign manufacturers and vaccine market experts.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden threw his support behind waiving patents for COVID-19 vaccines, thrilling those who have been pressuring his administration to help speed production of doses worldwide. If adopted by the World Trade Organization, the move would let other countries make their own copies of the much-coveted shots.\n\nBut the waiver would not address a less conspicuous but equally pressing problem: the growing worldwide shortage of vaccine ingredients and manufacturing equipment. The United States has a tight grip on a significant amount of those materials, such as filters, tubing and specialized disposable bags essential to making vaccines.\n\nCountries ravaged by the virus \u2013 including India, where a catastrophic explosion of cases has filled hospitals and morgues \u2013 cannot make vaccines without such supplies, even with access to manufacturers\u2019 cookbooks.\n\nThe problem stems from the U.S. reliance on a law dating to the Korean War in the 1950s, called the Defence Production Act (DPA), which gives federal agencies the power to prioritize procurement orders related to national defense. For decades, the law was used to supply the military as well as respond to everything from natural disasters to roadblocks in the decennial U.S. census.\n\nThe administration of former President Donald Trump invoked the act to put the U.S. government first in line to buy American-made vaccines as well as other products needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. In turn, vaccine makers have priority access to any supplies needed to fill U.S. orders.\n\nGavi \u2013 a vaccine alliance comprising international organizations, governments, drug companies and others \u2013 lauded the Biden administration\u2019s moves to increase global access to vaccines. Among other things, it cited the country\u2019s $4 billion commitment to COVAX, a global vaccine buying consortium Gavi co-leads with the World Health Organization.\n\nBut in response to questions about the DPA, Gavi said: \u201cThe greatest challenge to COVAX\u2019s goal of equitable access to vaccines is constrained global supply. Export controls on raw materials is a considerable contributor to this and ultimately only serve to prolong the pandemic.\u201d\n\nA senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there is no export ban, and all U.S.-based suppliers continue to ship products abroad after giving priority to U.S. manufacturers. The official said the DPA has not caused the global shortages of vaccine materials, and the problems stem instead from overwhelming demand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not enough to go around,\u201d the official said, noting that the administration is investing in increased raw material production.\n\nOn Wednesday, Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, briefly mentioned in her statement about Biden\u2019s patent decision that the administration would \u201cwork to increase the raw materials needed\u201d to make vaccines. She did not elaborate.\n\nVaccine components are produced all over the globe \u2013 in countries including the United Kingdom and China. But some leading suppliers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N), and the Danaher Corp (DHR.N) units Cytiva and Pall, are based in the United States. Reuters could not determine precisely what share of vaccine materials and equipment are made in America.\n\nThe DPA has helped the United States build a huge vaccine production system, ensuring reliable access to finished doses for Americans, and driving up revenue for U.S. pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAbout 45% of the US population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Dozens of other countries, from South Africa, to Guatemala, to Thailand, have vaccinated about 1% or less of their populations, according to data collected at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe DPA has drawn criticism from vaccine makers around the world, including the Serum Institute of India, the largest manufacturer globally.\n\nOn Twitter in late April, chief executive Adar Poonawalla requested \u201con behalf of the vaccine industry outside the United States\u201d that America lift its hold on raw materials \u201cif we are to truly unite in beating this virus.\u201d\n\nStarting this month, the company had planned to produce a billion doses annually of a vaccine developed by U.S.-based Novavax Inc (NVAX.O). But that output will be more than halved without American raw materials, according to a source familiar with the company\u2019s plans, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nSerum is also manufacturing COVISHIELD, a licensed version of the AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) vaccine.\n\nAfter weeks of public appeals from the Serum, the United States last month offered India filters needed to produce COVISHIELD. But India\u2019s need for vaccines and supplies remains vast. Serum is also meant to be a top supplier to other low- and middle-income countries. COVISHIELD and the Novavax shot form the backbone of the COVAX program.\n\nSerum, which declined to discuss the raw materials issue with Reuters, is not the only vaccine maker in need.\n\nThe South African vaccine maker Biovac Institute also relies on a U.S. company for bioreactor bags, needed for cell cultures. Biovac has been warned by its U.S. supplier that the usual lead time for bags may more than double to 14 months because of the U.S. DPA, chief executive Morena Makhoana told Reuters.\n\nManufacturers in some other countries say they are in better shape. Brazil\u2019s Butantan Institute has been able to buy supplies from both the United States and Europe, an executive told Reuters.\n\nFor instance, an order for supplies to make AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in the United States would be prioritized, even though the shot is not yet approved for use in the country. That could delay materials being sent to Serum, which is making the same vaccine for use in India and many other countries.\n\nFor now, three manufacturers\u2019 COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) \u2013 are approved for emergency use in the United States.\n\nAsked about the global consequences of getting priority on U.S. supplies, AstraZeneca did not comment and Moderna and J&J declined to comment. Pfizer did not directly address the U.S. DPA but said \u201cwe have gone to enormous efforts \u2026 as we seek to serve populations all over the world.\u201d\n\nSome suppliers say the industry would do a better job than governments at managing limited resources to maximize access globally.\n\n\u201cIf the end goal is, let\u2019s produce vaccines, then we\u2019re big believers that you need to let the industry connect the relevant parts so that we can deliver the end product,\u201d Thermo Fisher executive vice president Michel Lagarde told Reuters.\n\nThe Biden administration official said experts from various federal agencies discuss the use of the priority system during daily operations calls. Sometimes officials can change US delivery dates to avoid disrupting other vaccine projects abroad.\n\nBut suppliers are planning to get ahead of demand. Leading purveyors Cytiva, Pall and Thermo Fisher are expanding manufacturing space in the United States and abroad. Thermo Fisher has nudged customers to clarify which needs are urgent and which can wait days or weeks, and the company tries to find time to fill orders even if they are not rated as priorities, Lagarde said.\n\nCytiva said in a statement that it is expanding production, but is itself limited by some raw materials shortages.\n\n\u201cThe world is experiencing an unprecedented demand for biopharmaceutical products, technologies, and solutions,\u201d Cytiva said.\n\nReuters",
          "summary": "To fight the pandemic at home, the United States gave its own vaccine manufacturers priority access to American-made materials needed to make the shots.\nThe official said the DPA has not caused the global shortages of vaccine materials, and the problems stem instead from overwhelming demand.\nReuters could not determine precisely what share of vaccine materials and equipment are made in America.\nSerum, which declined to discuss the raw materials issue with Reuters, is not the only vaccine maker in need.\nCytiva said in a statement that it is expanding production, but is itself limited by some raw materials shortages.",
