But, however much you want someone, if there is no real spark forget it; though the fact you get on well with her means there is some hope.\n\nSo, explore the problem: what\u2019s making the relationship \u2018not easy\u2019, as she alleged? Would she be able to take things further if certain things were resolved? Ask what her difficulties are, then be prepared to change.\n\nIf there are some things you can do to improve your chances, then ask her what she needs from you \u2013 is it to see that you will get on well with her children? Give her some space too. Occasionally, someone says no because the timing isn\u2019t right but they will be glad to be asked later.\n\nPut the ball in her court, saying: \u201cIf you ever feel differently, please tell me.\u201d This gives her room to change her mind. If you have worked your way through all these and you are still getting a \u2018no\u2019, then it is time to call it off.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Apart from that, these extramarital games usually have little emotional value and do not provide romance let alone a happy new beginning.\n\nThe consequences of being found out are often immensely painful for everyone involved.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt you have feelings for this adulterer \u2013 there\u2019s always a feeling of lust between attractive partners when they have sex \u2013 it is elementary chemistry. Your husband\u2019s friend is obviously using you for sex and he\u2019s quite happy with the way things are.

Apostle Essien Ayi has faulted the Federal Government for not inaugurating the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nAccording to Ayi, \u201cThe Presidency was aiding illegalities by not inaugurating the NDDC Board and the presidency was allowing the endless operation of the commission with a caretaker committee and a Sole Administrator.\n\n\u201cThe ACT setting up the NDDC says that there will be a Board with a Chairman rotating within the States in the region and same for the Managing Director position. There is no provision for any caretaker committee or Sole Administrator. It is an illegal thing. There is no provision for sole administrator. If challenged in court, it will be set aside.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta, is doing and refusing to inaugurate the Board of the Commission that has been screened by the National Assembly. Is it the Forensic audit? Nobody is against the audit and it cannot conflict with the work of a new board. You cannot stop the inauguration of the Board because you want to do forensic audit. Are the new Board members part and parcel of what happened in the commission?\u201d\n\nAyi who represents Akpabuyo, Bakassi and Calabar South Federal Constituency noted that the argument that the present arrangement was to clean the system in the commission does not stand because \u201cwe have heard of many financial scandals in the present arrangement in the commission: a lot of complaints and alleged fraud.\n\n\u201cDuring this COVID-19 relief implementation, there are claims that over N6billion was spent arbitrarily on COVID-19 relief.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that, \u201cThe presence of a full NDDC Board will not hamper the work of forensic audit. What is presently obtainable is illegal and the Presidency is condoning the illegality. There is no amended ACT of the National Assembly that permits what is going on. The National Assembly is quiet because it is APC controlled. And they can\u2019t challenge the illegality over the NDDC, being perpetrated by the APC government. If we have to vote, they will vote you out\u201d.\n\nThe PDP Reps member also frowned at the present security situation in the country alleging that there is a lot of compromise in the security of the nation. \u201cHow can they tell me that 300 students have been kidnapped and they don\u2019t know where they are? You need about six luxurious buses to carry 300 persons. Where did they pass into the \u2018thin air\u2019 and no security trail\u201d.\n\nAyi who spoke in Calabar shortly after handing over equipment of different trades and vocations to empower the last set of 130 beneficiaries in his federal constituency, blamed the presidency directly for the non-inauguration of the NDDC Board.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has come under attack over plans to cut salaries of civil servants in Nigeria.\n\nMinister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed on Tuesday said that President Buhari ordered the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to reduce the salaries of workers and employees of several agencies to save costs in order to help the government reduce the high cost of governance.\n\nThis did not go down well with Nigerians who slammed the government for inflicting more pains on the people despite the high cost of living.\n\nSome Nigerians took to Twitter demanding that the government should begin by slashing of salaries from Senators, House of Reps and other expenses of top government officials.\n\nHere are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter:\n\n@Franklinbayo \u201cThe common will still bear the brunt. Why start the slash from the NASS. Why must the ordinary people suffer while the govt officials feed fat. This is why we need to get it right come 2023.\u201d\n\n@NdibuezeMonday \u201cThis Government is the worst instead of cutting their own salary to help this nation. If all of them cut 50% of their salaries from president to Chancellor then we will become a developed country.\u201d\n\n@Seunade \u201cWhy e be say na civil servant\u2019s de suffer,why not the senators,the house of reps,lg chairmen,councillor, governors salaries? Wetin civil servant\u2019s no go see for this Nigeria?\n\n@Irikefe12 \u201cOne of the characteristics of a clueless government, when the 30k minimum wages is not enough, but theirs almost 50m a month is not a problem.\u201d\n\n@Eye_hear_say, \u201cCivil servants, though am not one,work for their pay packets. The salary cut should start from the National Assembly down to the Executive arm of govt. The financial burden has ran the country aground without any commensurate gains. Politics should have less pecuniary incentives.\u201d\n\n@Ekwe_nsu \u201cOne person is a former governor, house of assembly, local government chairman and currently a senator and he or she receive money every month from all this yet civil servants\u2019 salary is the problem.

          "text": "The Chairman of the Niger Delta Affairs committee in the House of Representative, Hon. Apostle Essien Ayi has faulted the Federal Government for not inaugurating the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nAccording to Ayi, \u201cThe Presidency was aiding illegalities by not inaugurating the NDDC Board and the presidency was allowing the endless operation of the commission with a caretaker committee and a Sole Administrator.\n\n\u201cThe ACT setting up the NDDC says that there will be a Board with a Chairman rotating within the States in the region and same for the Managing Director position. There is no provision for any caretaker committee or Sole Administrator. It is an illegal thing. There is no provision for sole administrator. If challenged in court, it will be set aside.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta, is doing and refusing to inaugurate the Board of the Commission that has been screened by the National Assembly. Is it the Forensic audit? Nobody is against the audit and it cannot conflict with the work of a new board. You cannot stop the inauguration of the Board because you want to do forensic audit. Are the new Board members part and parcel of what happened in the commission?\u201d\n\nAyi who represents Akpabuyo, Bakassi and Calabar South Federal Constituency noted that the argument that the present arrangement was to clean the system in the commission does not stand because \u201cwe have heard of many financial scandals in the present arrangement in the commission: a lot of complaints and alleged fraud.\n\n\u201cDuring this COVID-19 relief implementation, there are claims that over N6billion was spent arbitrarily on COVID-19 relief.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that, \u201cThe presence of a full NDDC Board will not hamper the work of forensic audit. What is presently obtainable is illegal and the Presidency is condoning the illegality. There is no amended ACT of the National Assembly that permits what is going on. The National Assembly is quiet because it is APC controlled. And they can\u2019t challenge the illegality over the NDDC, being perpetrated by the APC government. If we have to vote, they will vote you out\u201d.\n\nThe PDP Reps member also frowned at the present security situation in the country alleging that there is a lot of compromise in the security of the nation. \u201cHow can they tell me that 300 students have been kidnapped and they don\u2019t know where they are? You need about six luxurious buses to carry 300 persons. Where did they pass into the \u2018thin air\u2019 and no security trail\u201d.\n\nAyi who spoke in Calabar shortly after handing over equipment of different trades and vocations to empower the last set of 130 beneficiaries in his federal constituency, blamed the presidency directly for the non-inauguration of the NDDC Board.",

          "title": "Oyetola is not an award freak",
          "text": "By Ismail Omipidan\n\nTwo years ago, on September 5, 2019, to be precise, an NGO, by name Nigeria Africa Development Indicators Monitoring Foundation (NADIM), visited the State to inform Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola that Osun had bagged overall best State in Nigeria in terms of development.\n\nAccording to NADIM, Osun came first because it scored over 50 percent in 12 out of the 18 Development Performance Indicators used for the assessment.\n\nHowever, Mr. Governor was sceptical and reluctant over the award; and he did not hide it. Once the team left, ahead of the ceremony the next day, Mr. Governor called me into his office. I was barely a month old in office at the time and said: \u201cI know we are doing our best. But I am not convinced we deserve the award. Most of the things we intend doing are just coming up.\u201d\n\nBased on our discussion that night, I returned to my office to rejig his speech to convey his true feelings about the award. And in the end, we came up with the following lines: \u201cWhen I was told our state was due for an award, I was sceptical. How can a government that is less than a year old be adjudged the overall best in the country, beating states like Lagos, Edo, Anambra and even the FCT among others, I asked. What were the indices used? All these were some of the questions that ran through my mind.\n\n\u201cAs a government, I know we are doing our best to provide good governance by continuing the transformation of Osun from where the last administration left off. But even at that I felt it was too early to begin to recognise us as the best-performing state in the country.\u201d\n\nOnce he read the first six paragraphs, Mr. Governor said: \u201cYou have indeed captured my mind. This is exactly the way I felt about the award.\u201d\n\nThat night, we left the office late, precisely by 1am. But I left fulfilled, seeing my Principal giving a pass mark.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut that is not the crux of this piece. The point I am making is, we are not award freak. We don\u2019t solicit for them. Are we deserving of the awards we have received in recent times? The answer is yes, especially based on the indices deployed to adjudge us. We took on 332 PHCs at a go, when others do between 20 and 100 at a go. We are not among 10 top states in terms of financial buoyancy, yet we are among the states paying minimum wage today. In spite of the state of the nation\u2019s economy, we have never defaulted in payment of salaries, pensions and gratuities, just as we are equally building new roads and work is ongoing on the ones we inherited. Interestingly, most of the roads we have done and the ones we are doing are those ones that had been touched in the last 30 years.\n\nWe run an all-inclusive government by ensuring that as a responsible and responsive government, we make people\u2019s demands the basis of our policies and implementation. We are very conscious of our diversification agenda. We believe that in no distant future, the state will begin to reap the gains of our diversification efforts in Agriculture, Culture and Tourism and Mining. If we can do all that we have done in just two years plus, it means there are better days, months, and years ahead for the State of the Virtuous.\n\nOmipidan is Chief Press Secretary to Gov Oyetola.",

          "text": "By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna; Tony Akowe and Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nThere was anxiety last night on the fate of 16 abducted students of Greenfield University \u2013 a private institution in Kaduna.\n\nThe kidnappers on Monday gave Tuesday\u2019s deadline for the payment of N100 million ransom or they would kill the students in their custody.\n\nThe parents said they had collectively paid N55 million and had no other money to pay.\n\nWhat further heightened the parents\u2019 fear is the release of one of the 17 students being held on to after killing five of the 22 students they kidnapped on April 20.\n\nIt was learnt on Tuesday that before they asked for the N100 million ransom, as announced by their spokesman who identified himself as Sani Jalingo during an interview with Voice of America (VOA) Hausa Service, the abductors had requested individual parents to pay N20 million.\n\nMrs. Lauretta Attahiru, mother of the freed student confirmed the release of her child, but did not give the conditions that led to his release.\n\nSome of the parents told reporters that Mrs Attahiru is the wife of a retired Army officer.\n\nA parent said last night: \u201cWe don\u2019t know their health situation; we don\u2019t know whether they are eating or they are not eating. We don\u2019t know the treatment or maltreatment they are going through.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cThey (bandits) have not changed their stand from what they said on VOA. They are still insisting on N100 million ransom.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, we don\u2019t know what to do, because we cannot raise such money as parents. We are calling on the government, particularly the Federal Government; we are begging that they should do whatever it takes to rescue our children from the forest or bush where they have been for so many days now.\u201d\n\nIn Abuja yesterday, parents of the 29 abducted College of Forestry Mechanisation students also in Kaduna State protested the non-release of their chairman.\n\nOn March 11, gunmen abducted 39 students of the college but later freed 10.\n\nThe parents appealed for the intervention of the National Assembly members to facilitate the release of their children.\n\nDressed mainly in black, the parents arrived at the National Assembly gate accompanied by leaders of the school\u2019s students\u2019 union and civil society groups. They accused the school management of not doing anything to secure the students\u2019 freedom.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey blocked the entrance to the Federal Secretariat axis of the complex when they were not allowed entry through the one-kilometre driveway leading to the main gate of the National Assembly complex.\n\nAfter waiting for a while, they headed to the Unity Fountain, opposite the Transcorp Hilton Hotel where representatives of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila , listened to their complaints.\n\nIt was a sober atmosphere as the parents wept while appealing for help.\n\nLeader of the parents, Abdullahi Usman, said, \u201cWe are here to appeal to the National Assembly to help us intervene and ensure the release of our children by the kidnappers.

The main opposition party said it was dropping the toga of politics in the national interest.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the PDP did not respect its own words, as it played cheap politics while playing the Ostrich. The party went ahead to make wild accusations against the president and his government. For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a \u2018government of exclusion\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe opposition party then went ahead to reel out a number of suggestions as a way out of the current challenges facing the nation. Unfortunately, the recommendations by the PDP have exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry and the fact that it was merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\n\u201cHad it not been so, and had it done its home work properly, the PDP would have known that most of those same recommendations were already contained in the outcome of the Federal Government\u2019s town hall meeting on national security in Kaduna on April 8.\n\n\u201cThe PDP accused this government of not engaging and of running a government of exclusion, forgetting, conveniently, that this Federal Government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Threatens to \u2018ruffle unruly feathers\u2019\n\n\u2022Accusation baseless, PDP, Afenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN fire back\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe presidency yesterday accused some religious and political leaders of plotting to forcibly remove President Muhammadu Buhari from office, warning that it would thwart the moves and ruffle some unruly feathers in the process.\n\nThe presidency, however, came under fire as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); the pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere; the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in separate reactions dismissed the allegation.\n\nThe main opposition party described the allegation as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nAfenifere said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said in a statement that available evidence indicated that some disgruntled religious and past political leaders are poised to throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel an undemocratic change of leadership.\n\nAdesina\u2019s statement came a day after the Department of State Services (DSS) alleged that some \u201cmisguided elements\u201d were threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nDSS spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Monday, had said that among those threatening the federal government and Nigeria\u2019s unity are \u201csome religious and past political leaders who have either called for a forceful change of government or mass action against it.\u201d\n\nThe presidency in a reaction to the DSS yesterday said there is proof that the disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of a conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed on the president, thus throwing the land into turmoil.\n\nIt stated: \u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country. The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nIt added that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999 and the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\u201d\n\nThe presidency also accused external forces of collaborating with some individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such moves.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country. But the presidency, already vested with mandate and authority by Nigerians till 2023, pledges to keep the country together, even if some unruly feathers would be ruffled in the process,\u201d it said.\n\nBut some analysts told THISDAY last night that the presidency might have been reacting to a grand move by some past leaders of the country to hold a conference to discuss the state of the nation, which they said had been hemmed by massive violence from non-state actors, including bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and separatist elements.\n\nThe conference being facilitated by a former head of state is expected to be attended by leaders of prominent regional political groups, civil society organisations, religious leaders and past political office holders.\n\nThe groundwork had reached an advanced stage and state intelligence agencies and the presidency, the analysts, said may have panicked in the fear that the conference in dissecting the litany of woes that have befallen the country may throw up conversations and conclusions that are certain to embarrass the Buhari administration.\n\nThis is Blackmail, PDP Fires Back\n\nReacting to the allegation, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) dismissed it, describing it as a resort to blackmail in the face of the failure of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe PDP said rather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing the nation, the presidency was engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that the Buhari presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically-elected government.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cThe presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically-elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood.\n\n\u201cEven in 2019, Nigerians will be quick to remember how the APC imported bandits, vandals and thugs from neighbouring countries, as political mercenaries, to unleash violence, disrupt our voting processes and muscle itself into power.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the presidency and the APC to look inwards for those allegedly plotting to upturn democracy.\n\n\u201cOur party believes that the statement by the Buhari presidency is an attempt by the APC to heighten political tension in our country ahead of the 2023 election, having realised that they cannot face the people at the polls,\u201d it added.\n\nThe PDP, however, advised the APC to know that such blackmail against Nigerians cannot work.\n\n\u201cFor us in the PDP, our party will remain undeterred, alongside other patriotic Nigerians, in our commitment towards the sustenance and stability of our democracy as well as the unity and corporate existence of our country, Nigeria,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF, CAN Dismiss allegation\n\nAfenifere, ACF, PANDEF and the CAN also dismissed the allegation by the presidency that some religious and political leaders are part of a plot to overthrow Buhari.\n\nThe leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said Buhari had lost control of the country\u2019s leadership, adding that nobody needs to pass a vote of no confidence in him before the whole world knows that he has failed Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that given Buhari\u2019s poor performance, there is no need for any group to \u201cgather anywhere to pass a vote of no confidence in him.\u201d\n\nAdebanjo, who described the 1999 Constitution as a fraud, also urged the president to, as a matter of urgency, return the 1964 Constitution agreed on by the founding fathers of Nigeria, including the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho is interested in passing vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him? That is not the issue. The main thing is to restructure the country back to federalism and forget all these gossips by Adesina. We don\u2019t have to pass a vote of no confidence for the world to know we don\u2019t have any confidence in Buhari.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any group who wants to take over the government, but I know those of us who want the country to be restructured in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cThose of us in Afenifere and all other groups in the South who are agitating for restructuring are the friends of Nigeria, are the friends of Buhari. I hope it is not too late for Buhari to realise this.\u201d\n\nACF also said it was wrong for the presidency to see all its critics as disgruntled people with ulterior motives.\n\nThe spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, told THISDAY that the presidency should be broad-minded and tolerate all shades of opinions.\n\nAccording to him, many criticisms against the government are done in good faith to help improve the situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany criticisms are done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of CAN, Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the president and his team were becoming confused.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president and his team have gone blind and confused since in their world view, Rev. Father Mbaka and others who are telling them the truth about what is happening in the country have now become enemies.\n\n\u201cYou should know they have run out of excuses and have turned to blackmail even those who love them and want them to do what is good for the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEvery religious leader who chooses to stand with the people and is demanding good governance is now disgruntled.\u201d\n\nThe CAN chairman said the presidency needed \u201cto pause a little and remember that these people whom they are calling names today stood with them and for them when those who think they know them more warned against it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians have since passed their vote on Buhari and his government after watching helplessly how bandits have taken over the country; our young university students are being killed and destroyed.\u201d\n\nHayab appealed to those who are making statements on behalf of the presidency to be careful with their poor words and strive to win the support and confidence of the people with love and facts, not blackmail.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the CAN President on Media and Communications, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said beyond praying for things to get better, religious leaders reserved the right to criticise the authorities if they were not doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf the government accused some religious and past political leaders of planning to remove President Muhammadu Buhari, in what ways has that concerned the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)? The biblical responsibilities of the church include but not limited to praying for those who are in the position of authority but to criticise when doing wrongs or performing below the average. Check the Bible; there was never a time a bad ruler was spared from criticism,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the government should pre-occupy itself with how best to tackle insecurity and ensure the wellbeing of the people.\n\n\u201cOur candid advice to the government is to find an answer to the menace of insecurity occasioned by the bandits, kidnappers and terrorists. The country is approaching the precipice and President Muhammadu Buhari is in the position of rescuing the country by stopping the unprecedented bloodshed.\n\n\u201cIt is only the fool that goes to bed when his roof is on fire. Our members and non-members are being kidnapped and killed while the government appears helpless,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, fixing the security challenges is beyond issuing press releases or threatening to deal with the criminals.\n\nHe stated that 24 hours after Buhari vowed never to tolerate any banditry attack on schools, the bandits struck, adding that the victims are still in captivity.\n\n\u201cWhat is the government doing to rescue the victims? Some university students who were kidnapped in Kaduna are being killed but the government is too busy threatening the critics. We advise the presidency to recall all the promises made by Buhari during the electioneering and what is happening under his watch. Until his government wakes up to its responsibilities, the church will not keep quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a reaction, PANDEF National Publicity Secretary, Hon Ken Robinson, expressed shock that the presidency would under the prevailing situation of disastrous insecurity tag religious leaders and past political leaders \u201cdisgruntled.\u201d\n\nHe said such a statement was the least expected from government.\n\nThe group urged the presidency to stop chasing shadows, stressing that Nigerians are anxious, troubled and many are becoming hopeless over the worsening insecurity, while the security agencies appear helpless and vulnerable.\n\nPANDEF asked Buhari to involve all critical stakeholders nationwide in efforts at finding solutions to the problems facing the nation.\n\nIt said: \u201cWhat we expect from President Muhammadu Buhari, at this time, is to rally all critical stakeholders, from all sectors and sections of the country, to build national consensus and fashion out collective and holistic ways to address the hybrid problems confronting the country.

          "text": "\u2022Abductors free one more captive\n\n\u2022Security council meeting continues today\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe federal government yesterday expressed its commitment to do all it could to save the remaining 16 students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, whose abductors have threatened to kill for the delay in ransoming them.\n\nAt a press conference in Abuja where he faulted the recommendations by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in resolving the growing insecurity in the country, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the federal government, in line with its constitutional responsibility of protecting all Nigerians, would not fold its arms and allow the bandits who kidnapped the students execute them.\n\nThe bandits had on Monday threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom was not met by yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by yesterday, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nOf the about 22 students abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm, the bandits have killed five.\n\nHowever, the bandits might have reconsidered their decision to kill the remaining students yesterday as one of them was freed under a yet-to-be-clear circumstances. Their parents also appealed to the bandits to spare the lives of the students.\n\nAt the press conference in Abuja, Mohammad also spoke on efforts by the federal government to combat the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHowever, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the three service chiefs will tomorrow brief the Senate on their efforts so far to address the security problems.\n\nMohammed also faulted the recommendations by the PDP in resolving the security crisis, saying the contents of its recent press conference had exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of Monday\u2019s press briefing by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, in which he canvassed, among others, state police, devolution of powers and the establishment of border protection council, as part of steps to combat insecurity.\n\nMohammed accused PDP of merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\nThe minister also threatened to expose the forces behind the current security challenges at the \u2018\u2019appropriate time\u2019\u2019 and deal with them.\n\nHe stated that the alarm raised by the Department of State Services (DSS) on the plot by some powerful forces to destabilise the government only confirmed the consistent position of the federal government that there were plots by some political forces to make the country ungovernable.\n\nHe said the federal government was shocked that \u2018\u2019a party that ruled the country for all of 16 years does not know that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offences.\u201d\n\nIt advised the PDP to call out the states, including those being controlled by it, to ensure a rigorous prosecution of arrested kidnappers and bandits.\n\n\u2018\u2019PDP conveniently forgot that as far as terrorism, a federal offence, is concerned, this federal government has successfully prosecuted thousands of Boko Haram members in Kainji, as part of a continuing exercise. We are now seeking the cooperation of the judiciary to continue with the trial of arrested terrorists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister explained that while PDP claimed to have ostensibly offered suggestions to the federal government on some topical issues, especially national security by dropping the toga of politics in the national interest, the party played cheap politics.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019The party went ahead to make wild accusations against the president and his government. For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a government of exclusion.\n\n\u2018\u2019The opposition party then went ahead to reel out a number of suggestions as a way out of the current challenges facing the nation. Unfortunately, the recommendations by the PDP have exposed the opposition party\u2019s gimmickry, and the fact that it was merely playing politics with serious national issues, especially security.\n\n\u2018\u2019Had it not been so, and had it done its homework properly, the PDP would have known that most of those same recommendations were already contained in the outcome of the federal government\u2019s town hall meeting on national security, which was held in Kaduna on April 8, 2021,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.\n\nAbductors Free One More Kaduna Student\n\nMeanwhile, one of the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, has been released.\n\nThe mother of the released student, Mrs. Lauretta Attahiru, confirmed this yesterday to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nShe, however, declined to make further comments on how her son was released.\n\nThe police could not also be reached to confirm the release of the student as Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police command, did not respond to telephone calls and a text message.\n\nThe parents had earlier said the bandits had been negotiating with them individually, asking each of them to pay as high as N20 million, before they eventually demanded a bulk of N100 million and 10 motorcycles on Monday.\n\nWith the release of the student, the fate of the remaining 16 students remained uncertain yesterday, especially given the bandits\u2019 threat to kill them over the inability to ransom them.\n\nAlso yesterday, the President of the National Association of Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTA), Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, pleaded with the bandits to spare the lives of their victims.\n\nDanjuma told journalists in Kaduna that the parents of the affected students and Nigerians had been gripped by fear and tension following the threat by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cWe are simply begging them not to kill any other student in view of the fact that they are innocent.\n\n\u201cThe deadline is really worrisome and we as parents, are concerned and worried over the lives of our students and teachers of the university,\u201d he said.\n\nA former senator who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, also appealed to Fulani socio-cultural groups to intercede to secure the release of the students.\n\nSani tweeted that he had privately appealed to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore to help secure the release of the students.\n\nSecurity Council Meeting Continues Today\n\nMeanwhile, the National Security Council (NSC) meeting held yesterday at the State House, Abuja, to deliberate on the security challenges facing the nation will continue today at the same venue.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting, which will be the third in less than a week, will as usual be presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIndications that the meeting will continue today was emerged when yesterday\u2019s meeting ended without any media briefing or press statement issued.\n\nAlso, the President of the Senate, Dr .Ahmad Lawan, at Senate plenary on why the CDS and the service chiefs could not appear before the senators yesterday, said at the commencement of plenary that the military top brass could not honour invitation due to the National Security Council meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, the National Security Council is continuing its meeting that it started last week. Therefore the invited security heads will not be able to come for the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure if they will finish their meeting today (Tuesday). We assume it could spill to Wednesday too,\u201d he added.\n\nLawan, however, said the CDS and the service chiefs would brief the Senate tomorrow on the security situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have now fixed the date for the briefing to be Thursday, May 6,\u201d adding that the briefing will enrich the knowledge of his colleagues about security issues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Mergers of MDAs, budget review on the card\n\n\u2022Akabueze proposes six-region structure\n\nNdubuisi Francis, Olawale Ajimotokan and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has initiated a raft of measures to cut the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue occasioned by the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant global economic tailspin.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said yesterday in Abuja that the measures were targeted at reducing recurrent expenditure, which is projected to gulp about 41.5 per cent of the total provisions of N13.588 trillion in the 2021 budget, amounting to N5.64 trillion.\n\nShe stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the salaries and wages committee to review the payroll of public servants as well as consider the merger of some agencies.\n\nBesides, the government will also remove some unnecessary items from the budget as a move to cut the cost of governance.\n\nAhmed spoke at a policy dialogue on \u2018corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria,\u2019 organised by the Independent Corrupt Practice and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nAlso at the occasion, the Director-General, Budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, proposed a constitutional amendment to pave the way for the restructuring of the country into six regions instead of the present 36 states structure. This, he said, would help to reduce the rising cost of governance.\n\nAhmed stated that the proposed cost-saving measures was aimed at streamlining government expenditure with revenue.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue.\u201d\n\nShe urged all government agencies to come together to trim the cost amid the country\u2019s dwindling revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the nation\u2019s budgets are filled every year with projects that are recycled and that are also not necessary.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair, work together with the head of service and other members of the committee to review the government pay rolls in terms of stepping down on cost,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister said the federal government would also review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates, adding that the government will consider merging two agencies with the same mandate.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe need to work together; all agencies of the government to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures\u2013expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year-in-year out with projects that we see over and over again and also projects that are not necessary.\u201d\n\nAkabueze, in a paper titled: \u2018Reducing the Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u2019 described the country\u2019s current system of democratic governance as very expansive and expensive.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that mandated the president to appoint a minister from at least each of the 36 states, should be amended to reduce the number of federal cabinet members.\n\nHe cited the large federal structure to be one of the drivers of the high cost of governance and engendering public outcry that government spending is largely on recurrent activities at the expense of capital projects.\n\nWhile describing the subsisting fiscal policy as unsustainable, Akabueze said the persistent call for the reduction of governance cost had continued to gain momentum in view of its impact on government fiscal situation.\n\nHe stated that the cost of governance is considerably cheaper in the United States from where Nigeria copied the presidential system of government.\n\nAccording to him, the general cost of administration in the United States is less than 10 per cent of the total annual budgets while the United States, with a higher population than Nigeria, has only 15 secretaries and executive departments as against Nigeria, which has 27 ministers, 16 ministers of state and 27 ministries.\n\nHe lamented that the federal government is maintaining 943 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) with many of them having duplicated functions.\n\n\u201cThere are 541 federal government-owned public corporations and enterprises. We need to cut these in order to install efficiency in governance. Also, we have a bloated civil service. The current civil service structure and size is clearly unsustainable for Nigeria\u2019s economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe warned against the tendency where the civil service is accorded political, ethnic and religious patronage.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive staff auditing and job available is imperative to determine the right size of the federal civil service without having any adverse effect on the service. And to avoid duplication in the civil service, the staff rationalisation programme should be gradual,\u201d he added.\n\nAkabueze said the federal government\u2019s recurrent spending accounted for more than 75 per cent of the actual MDAs expenditure between 2011 and 2020, in addition to personnel cost which accounted for government significant spending.\n\nHe accused the MDAs of incurring excessive personnel costs and wilfully indulging in wide range of underhand practices that are driving governance cost out of the ordinary.\n\nAccording to him, in 2016, personnel cost was N1.87 trillion while at the moment the same cost has spiralled to over N3 trillion.\n\nThe effect of the rising cost of running government, Akabueze added, is the reason why only 30 per cent of the budget is available for capital project and the cause behind many abandoned capital projects nationwide.\n\nHe said: \u201cPersonnel cost accounted for 31 per cent and 63 per cent of the total spending and retained revenue in 2020. In the USA, the general administration cost is less than 10 per cent of total budget.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe challenged Nigerians to task themselves on governance, saying that the success story of the Asian Tiger was a product of sound leadership and determination.\n\nICPC Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, described the cost of governance as the driver of corruption in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government was committed to improving the country\u2019s revenue by focusing on new and existing sources and by streamlining payroll.\n\nHe added that the federal government would also ensure removal of subsidies and reduction in the cost of contracts and procurement are for the benefits of the vulnerable.\n\nHe listed critical area of concern to include payroll padding and the phenomenon of ghost workers.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s intended cost-cutting approach is coming amid a report by a public finance transparency advocacy firm, BudgIT that the 2021 federal budget contains over 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion.\n\nBudgIT, a public finance transparency advocacy firm, said in a report that the duplication of projects was just one among other loopholes for corruption in the budget.\n\nIt added that there were no audit records of N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\n\nIt said: \u201cOur investigations into the 2021 budget revealed at least 316 duplicated capital projects worth N39.5 billion, with 115 of those duplicate projects occurring in the Ministry of Health. This is very disturbing, especially considering the health infrastructure deficit and the raging COVID-19 pandemic affecting Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBudgIT also found zero audit records of the N10.02 trillion received by the security sector between 2015 and 2021.\u201d\n\nIt also alleged that budgetary provisions were made for agencies for projects that are beyond their execution. It added: \u201cEven worse, agencies now receive allocations for capital projects they cannot execute. For example, the National Agriculture Seed Council has an allocation for N400m to construct solar street lights across all six geopolitical zones, while the Federal College of Forestry in Ibadan in Oyo State got N50m for the construction of street lights in Edo State.\n\n\u201cThese are aberrations that need to be corrected.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Presidency emphasised that Nigerians have opted for democratic rule since 1999, adding that the only accepted way to change a democratically elected government is through elections, \u201cwhich hold at prescribed times in the country as any other way is patently illegal, and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences\u201d.\n\nIt also accused external forces of collaborating with the mischievous individuals and groups to cause crisis in the country and warned that it will not take kindly to such move.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country. But the Presidency, already vested with mandate and authority by Nigerians till 2023, pledges to keep the country together, even if some unruly feathers would be ruffled in the process,\u201d the release added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

If he can be trusted enough by Boko Haram, he should trust himself enough to lead negotiation to release the Afaka and Greenfield students.\n\n\u201cThey love it when people are suffering; they love it when there is pain.

          "text": "Tony Elumelu, chairman of Heirs Holdings, says the United Bank for Africa (UBA) did not fund the acquisition of oil mining licence 17 (OML 17).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, Heirs Holdings, in partnership with Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, announced the unconditional acquisition of a 45 per cent participating interest in OML 17 through TNOG Oil and Gas Limited, their associated company.\n\nThe acquisition included all assets of the previous owners \u2014 Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) (30 per cent), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (10 per cent) and ENI (five per cent) \u2014 in the lease.\n\nElumelu serves as chairman of UBA, Transcorp and Heirs Holdings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview on Arise TV on Wednesday, Elumelu said UBA did not participate in the acquisition of OML 17.\n\nHe said the fund was obtained from other international and local lenders including African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), Absa in South Africa, Fidelity Bank and Union Bank.\n\n\u201cOn the oil and gas acquisition we just made, UBA did not even participate in the funding. It is a club of international and local lenders,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe local receiving bank for our proceeds is Union Bank of Nigeria, the international receiving bank for the proceed of our oil sales is Standard Chartered Bank London.\n\n\u201cThe transaction, if people read, was funded by consortium of banks including Afrexim, Absa in South Africa, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank and a host of other internationals.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful of all these issues and we are very prudent in making sure we do not put pressure on the banks. We go out to seek funds to support our operations, we also put in equity in our investment but when we need to get funding we try not to put pressure on the institution.\u201d\n\nElumelu said OML 17 currently produces 31,000 barrels of oil daily. He said the company targets a daily production of 100,000 barrels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group chairman said the acquisition of the oil field portrays the organisation\u2019s commitment in the energy sector.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of investment in oil and gas is one that speaks to our overall energy strategy. Our energy strategy is integrated. It is to make sure we help Nigerian citizens and Africans to have access to electricity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe acquired OML 17 and we made a case to NNPC by justifying that we have the capacity and capability to operate the asset and they approved for us to operate.\n\n\u201cI am happy to say that it is a truly indigenous oil and gas company owned and operated by Nigerians. Today, we produce about 31,000 barrels of oil per day which is a slight improvement. Our ambition is to do over 100,000 barrels of oil per day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElumelu also called for the development of Nigeria\u2019s power sector, saying 100,000 megawatts of power is needed daily to drive the economy.\n\nHe identified efforts made by The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), a non-governmental organisation headed by him, in supporting African entrepreneurs.\n\nThe philanthropist noted that about 10,000 African entrepreneurs have benefit from TEF, but added that some beneficiaries in Nigeria may not succeed due to poor power supply.",

It\u2019s a word of prophecy. To let you know, that this King Saul was not his choice. That King Saul was imposed upon him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGod said Saul was imposed upon him, it was not his choice. It was the church that imposed King Saul on God. The Lord warned us and said, this is what he (Saul) would do\u2026he would take your daughters and make them into his confectionaries. He would take your sons to run ahead of his chariots. He would make them servants.\n\n\u201cThe one that caught my attention the most is when he said he would take your choice land and give it to his kinsmen. That is exactly what is playing out in our nation. I took time to really plead before the Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually for months, I kept crying, it went into years. The error started in 2014 when we said this man is the most righteous man, the only righteous man. How can you give the title of Jesus Christ to a man? So, from 2015, we started crying after realising our errors.\u201d\n\nPaul, however, said God told him that he has already prepared a David to restore normalcy to the country again.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, those who stood up loud to say this is the man haven\u2019t publicly apologise for their mistake. But I said to the Lord, if I am the David of the last days, then I am here pleading before you. I said Lord, I have been calling upon you from 2015 to 2020 and said to him out of anger, does it take you this long to forgive? I thought he (God) was going to say, it\u2019s okay, I have changed my mind,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut he simply said to me\u2026David is coming. Then I said to the Lord, what then happens to Saul, he replied, I have rejected him from ruling my people. I have found a new king after my own heart, he also told me whatever happened in the time of Saul is what is happening now. Then I asked him what?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe said what qualification does Saul have to become a king? He was not intelligent; he could not even tell the footprints of donkeys. This one (Buhari) is also the same. The Lord said to me, the only qualification Saul had was his height. Only height, no qualification.\n\n\u201cThis one (Buhari) also has no primary school certificate, no secondary. None. Everybody has checked everywhere for his certificates; he does not have any\u2026only height. So, I asked the Lord what would happen, he told me he is going to take them out. I said if you take them out, what about their sons, then he said what happened to Saul, did he die alone?\n\n\u201cThe Lord said to me, for the next 40 years, these people will struggle, they will try everything to come back, and they will not succeed. I calculated 40 years from now; I will be 110. After 40 years, there will not be a remembrance of them anymore, forever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "text": "Lami, a Kenyan insurtech company democratizing insurance products and services for low-income Kenyans, has raised $1.8 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Accion Venture Lab.\n\nFounded by Jihan Abass in 2018, Lami is a digital insurance platform that enables partner businesses \u2013 including banks, tech companies, and other entities to easily and seamlessly offer digital insurance products to their users via its API.\n\nLami can also be used by partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs. Through its API, users can get a quotation for motor, medical, or other tailored insurance products in seconds, then customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit their needs. They get their policy documents instantly and claims are paid in record time.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal Abass said, \u201cSimilar to a payment API/gateway, we process insurance KYC, pricing of products, underwriting of products and claims processing in real time. Let me give you an example, Jumia wanted to launch an insurance marketplace but they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of integrating with every single insurance company and they didn\u2019t want to manage the process of issuing policies. Using our API because we have 20 insurance companies on our platform, they were able to launch this marketplace with a large number of products.\u201d\n\nJulian Abbas Founder & CEO\n\nThe Insurance space in Africa\n\nWith a 3% penetration rate (except for South Africa), Africa\u2019s insurance market is lagging behind. In Kenya where Lami is based less than 20% of the population has access to health insurance.\n\nThe major cause of the low adoption is that most insurance providers on the continent fail to offer flexible, affordable and tailored insurance coverage that can provide a safety net for the African consumer. For example, under most health policies customers face restrictions on what facilities and treatments are covered, they struggle to understand coverage terms and face complicated and lengthy claims processes. This results in a longer processing cycle, poor customer satisfaction, and higher distribution costs.\n\nLami\u2019s services are enabled by its flexible insurance rating engine and direct integration with several parties and insurance companies. Lami co-designs innovative products with its underwriting partners to enable businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base, with flexible options that meet their needs and cash flows, such as monthly medical policies for startup employees.\n\nLami\u2019s CEO Jihan Abass said, \u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more people, improving our technology, and growing our presence across Africa as we can continue to address the persistent insurance gap. At Lami, our vision is to help improve the financial resilience of millions by making insurance products more accessible and affordable for underserved populations. By enabling our business partners to offer customized insurance solutions, we are helping them provide more value to their customers, while enabling large volumes of users to access insurance, often for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe Lami team at work\n\nSince its inception, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies and has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer, and Madison Insurance, distributing more than 30 products available including medical, motor, employee benefits, and device insurance. As an innovator in the digital insurance space, Lami aims to continue diversifying its business by looking for new partners and building on its core technology.\n\nMichael Schlein, President and CEO, Accion Venture Lab, said, \u201cNinety-seven percent of Africans lack access to insurance \u2013 a financial safety net that can help them build resilience against economic shocks. Lami helps address this need for consumers across Africa through its innovative approach that leverages technology and partnerships to help any business develop and sell insurance.\u201d\n\nWithin the past month Malian insurtech OKO and Nigerian insurtech Curacel raised a combined amount of $1.6 million, Lami\u2019s funding news is a reminder that there\u2019s some activity in the African insurtech space. Also, with less than 5% of venture capital going to female-led startups in 2019, it\u2019s positive news to see another female-led company being funded.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fourth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

          "title": "Microtraction\u2019s novel approach to early-stage investments in Africa is paying off",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on conversations with investors in Africa \u2013 investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, private equities, venture capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nYele Bademosi didn\u2019t start out in the tech space. Being born to parents in the medical field, he attempted to toe that same line. When he gained admission to study medicine at King\u2019s College London, it seemed like his path had been charted, until a few years later when he dropped out. Medicine just wasn\u2019t his passion.\n\nAfter leaving medical school, he launched his first startup in the UK \u2013 Purple, a social app that let university students with shared interests in the UK find and connect with each other. After efforts to scale the social media app proved abortive, he shut down the project and flew back to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, he got a job as a general manager of Starta \u2013 an online community and resource platform for African startup entrepreneurs. He helped Starta reach over 24,000 subscribers in eight months before it was acquired in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, after developing a taste for helping startups get off the ground, he founded Microtraction, an early-stage venture capital fund that has gone on to invest in over 15 startups.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed Director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of crypto platform, Binance. He was charged with developing Africa\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. He held this role until April 2020.\n\nIn August 2019, he founded Bundle, a social payments app for cash and cryptocurrency.\n\nOur conversation began with trying to understand what spurred Badamosi to hop on the venture capital train earlier than most people.\n\nYele Bademosi: I think the ecosystem is a lot different today than it was five years ago when I initially began thinking about the idea for Microtraction (MT).\n\nFor context, I spent about nine months working with Dotun, who is also a VC at Novastar. One of the things that we were doing was trying to help entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses through knowledge and networks. I realized from that experience that it was difficult for founders to raise money.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t really have any other avenue if they didn\u2019t have a network or a rich relative. That was what really drove this idea. How do we create an easier way for founders to raise money?\n\nAnother thing was the incubation model, which was also popular in Nigeria at the time, wasn\u2019t really a good fit for the market. We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\n\nI wanted to find an alternative means to invest and support entrepreneurs. This birthed the MT model. This idea of an open application for funding with fixed check sizes without a program or a demo day was something that was unique at the time and MT was the first vehicle to do something like that.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What did Micro traction think was missing?\n\nYB: For us, it was more about streamlining. People went into a physical space with a batch of other companies and at the end, there was a demo day. That was the norm \u2013 the YC model. Interestingly, we raised capital from a bunch of limited partners, including Michael Siebel (YC\u2019s CEO).\n\nWe didn\u2019t do programs because we felt that the materials that were being taught weren\u2019t entirely applicable to Nigeria and Africa at large. We also felt that that drove up the costs of running this program. You would spend anything from 60-80% on programs and only deploy maybe 20%. So from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\n\nThe second critical part was the batch model. You can\u2019t predict the timeline of the creation of quality companies. We felt that when you invest in batches, you end up investing in companies that may not be ready to take on external capital yet, or might not be venture backable. What we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\n\nThe third thing was this idea of demo days. I\u2019ve been to a number of demo days. Some of them were very well prepared, presented, and executed, but when you looked at the amount of funding that was picked up by these companies, it was quite low.\n\nWe prefer investor intros, building networks of investors, connecting our founders to investors who will invest in them.\n\nSo those three things: No batches, no programs, no demo days. That\u2019s what made the MT model unique.\n\nThe Microtraction Team\n\nDA: Interesting, I always thought MT was like YC. So what does your support look like?\n\nYB: It varies, there are a bunch of partners now at MT. My strength really is in product and business strategy. Chidinma, one of our partners, is very strong at financial operations for business and governance. Dayo is an ex-founder, he is able to provide first-hand experience of getting a business off the ground and what not to do or do. Ife is probably one of the best recruiters in the world. Antonia is our communications chief. Each person brings a unique set of skills that can help our companies.\n\nI think one thing we always tell founders, and I believe now more than ever especially since I\u2019ve started a startup is that a founder is what makes a company successful. We actually believe that our job is not to make \u2018okay\u2019 founders good, but to find great founders and cut the red tape or barriers that hinder them from building great companies.\n\nWe have a ton of various individuals and companies that are able to help our companies across hiring, fundraising, talent, business strategy, growth, regulatory and PR. A rolodex that you can go to get support and grow your company is very key. Now as the number of portfolio companies continues to scale, we also have a network of founders who are working in complementary spaces and they can learn from each other and connect with each other and open up their networks to each other.\n\nDA: What does a day look like at MT?\n\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies. Obviously, we spend more time with companies we\u2019ve just invested in versus a company that has been in our portfolio for three years.\n\nWe are also very honest with ourselves. We are a pre-seed fund. Our biggest impact is when you\u2019re getting off the ground; just having a listening ear and being able to help you think through the decisions that you want to make as a business.\n\nAnd as founders/ex-founders there\u2019s a very high level of empathy. We spend maybe 20% of our time networking with other investors and other players in the space or non-investors just building your network because your network is your capital as an investor. That\u2019s how we help our companies recruit or raise the next round of capital. 20% or 25% is spent talking to companies in our pipeline. The last 55% is spent on our portfolio companies.\n\nMT Partners, Dayo koleowo and Chidinma Iwueke\n\nDA: MT has a bias to invest in startups with technical founders/co-founders, why?\n\nYB: I think that really comes from my own experience as a founder. When I started my first company right out of leaving medical school, I tried without a technical founder and it was incredibly difficult.\n\nI raised money and spent money on outsourcing. Actually, I think I was fortunate with the developer I got because he actually built the product, but it took a long time because it wasn\u2019t the only thing he was working on. And it cost a lot of money. When I needed to make changes, I didn\u2019t have the capital to make the changes and I was extremely slow. It took about six, seven months to get to market.\n\nWhile this was going on, I had a friend in the UK who we used to build stuff together. He was technical, I was a product designer. We would have an idea on Thursday, meetup on Friday or Saturday, by Sunday evening we built something and it was on Play Store and App Store. It really confirmed to me the importance of having people on the team who have some kind of technical skill, because at the end of the day what gives a startup a high valuation is growth and what gives you the leverage for growth is the fact that your business is either software-based or tech-enabled in some way.\n\nIf we give you money and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders. We\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\n\nDA: MT offers only $25,000 for 7% equity to every company, why?\n\nYB: Essentially, it is more around standardisation. If we had to negotiate every single deal that we were going into, then it would be quite challenging. We\u2019re having numerous conversations because every investment we make, we\u2019re talking to another five or six companies. That\u2019s even at the investment committee level, at the second or third phone call or team call it\u2019s another 20 companies for every single investment. We think it\u2019s fair for these companies with little or no revenue but we also review our deal structure from time to time.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your due diligence process like and what\u2019s the time frame?\n\nYB: We have a due diligence checklist, essentially a lot of which is more around governance. Governance because we invest early in these companies, we make sure that the company has the right documents and structure to make them investible. We literally spend a lot of time actually getting documents like incorporation, founder vesting agreements, also reference calls \u2013 just things that show the company has good governance.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the areas that I think we can actually improve upon, which is saying, how much should you and can you fund an early-stage company that has not been in existence for a very long time. There are some that are less than a week because the company is prepared or usually it takes weeks, it depends on how prepared the company is.\n\nDayo Koleowo at TechCabal\u2019s Edtech Townhall\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nYB: When I think of what will make me not invest in this company, the first thing is market opportunity. How big can this business be? Venture capital is extremely skewed. It\u2019s really about maximum upside as opposed to protecting your downside. What I mean by that is when we invest in companies we try to project the best possible outcome for the company.\n\nSo if the maximum upside is still looking like a small company, then we won\u2019t invest. That\u2019s probably why we say no to the vast majority of companies.\n\nNumber two is the progress made over time. I ask myself, am I impressed with how fast the company has moved within a particular time period? For a lot of companies, their progress over time isn\u2019t impressive especially when there are other companies to benchmark in that space.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the team. How good is the team? I don\u2019t do this as much anymore, but when I first started, I used to ask myself a question \u2018would I work for this founder?\u2019\n\nIf I had just moved back, starting off my career in the Nigerian or African tech ecosystem, and I saw this company, would I want to join them? Obviously, after five years, it\u2019s not the same so I can\u2019t really use that same benchmark because things are a lot different. But I still ask would I love to work for this founder? A lot of times when the answer is yes, the team is usually very strong.\n\nThe intersection of team, market and progress over time is what we look at. When a company fails those things, I\u2019m typically not interested in investing.\n\nDA: How has Covid-19 affected MT?\n\nYB: We actually continued investing during the pandemic. COVID had a bigger effect on startups than investors because investors have already collected money upfront. As an investor, you\u2019re not directly affected, it will affect your portfolio companies. I think COVID-19 impacted the quantity and quality of deal flow \u2013 the rate at which we receive investment offers.\n\nDA: Any exits from your end?\n\nYB: At MT, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to exit some of our positions, but we\u2019ve not taken those offers primarily because we still believe that there are significant opportunities for these companies to grow. The beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments. Most people when they hear exits they think about exits like the Paystack exit but the less popular/more common exit is usually a secondary exit where an investor exits or sells some of its shares to an existing investor or incoming investor. What we\u2019ll learn with this ecosystem is that exits are just a matter of time and we\u2019ll definitely see more exits in the future.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the tech space?\n\nYB: We\u2019re going to see a lot of investments going into fintech. I think we are going to see larger rounds coming into the industry. They\u2019ll stimulate a lot more stuff up in crypto, but they will move beyond the exchanges. I think crypto will probably be the second or at least in the top five sectors. Recently, I was looking at deals I did at Binance labs. I think from a fundraising perspective those deals probably outperformed any group of recent investments given the time that they took to raise over a million within a year to 18 months.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see some innovations in real money gaming, not just sports betting, but through playing games where you can win/ lose some money or some prizes.\n\nI think there\u2019ll be some moves in what I call export services, or export software services, which are essentially entrepreneurs that build products offered to global markets. I would definitely love to invest in anyone that is building anything around those ideas \u2013 crypto, gaming and export services.",
          "summary": "We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\nSo from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\nWhat we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies.\nThe beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments.",

The conference\u2019s overarching theme is re-asserting Africa\u2019s story and creating opportunities from the prevalent challenges, rather than only discussing them.\n\nIn line with this objective, the conference\u2019s Innovation Fair, a five-year-old initiative within the Oxford Africa Conference, will take place on May 28th and 29th, 2021. This year, a cohort of 11 early-stage ventures from over 150 applications have been selected for the Fair.\n\nThese ventures operate in African countries across four sectors critical to the continent\u2019s post-pandemic future: creative (art, fashion, film etc.), education, healthcare, and sustainability. Prior to the Fair, the ventures will conduct strategy with the MBA cohort at Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. For the two days, the companies will receive networking opportunities, masterclasses, and mentorship. The Fair will culminate in a pitch competition where cash prizes will be awarded to the winners.\n\nThis pitch competition will be live streamed for conference attendees on Saturday, May 29, from 2 to 5 pm. Each pitch will include a 5-minute Q&A session with a judging panel made up of academics and investors connected to the University of Oxford.\n\nTo be part of these impactful programs, you can purchase a ticket to the conference here and gain access to world-class speakers and view exciting start-ups reshaping Africa\u2019s future.",

          "text": "Texas, Lagos, and Mexico City; 29 April 2021: Platform Capital (\u201cPlatform\u201d), a leading growth markets investor, is pleased to announce it led a $1.3 million investment round into STRAP Technologies (\u201cSTRAP\u201d), an innovative company that has developed the world\u2019s first total technology replacement of the white cane for the blind & visually impaired.\n\nGlobally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindless, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden with the associated annual productivity losses estimated to be over $25.4 billion. The leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.\n\nSTRAP has developed a range of hardware and software solutions that address the mobility challenges that the blind and visually impaired encounter daily. After years of R&D and extensive testing, STRAP has integrated its solutions into a lightweight, chest-worn device that guides the blind and visually impaired by calculating the proximity of physical environments, allowing them to move unaided. This hands-free wearable harness uses haptic language to warn of hazards like an oncoming passer-by, walls, steps, and even changing elevations on sidewalks and other pathways. The company has received significant pre-orders from over 6,000 customers across North & Latin America and will ship its devices in Q4 2021. For a video overview of STRAP\u2019s technology in action, click here.\n\nThe company is also backed by International Accelerator and a group of Angel Investors. As part of Platform Capital\u2019s investment, Dr. Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Platform Capital, joins the Board of STRAP.\n\nDiego Roel, Founder and CEO of STRAP Technologies said \u201cSTRAP is the first assistive technology on the market that replaces the white cane that\u2019s been in use for over 100 years. I am inspired and excited by this recent investment and support in what STRAP is doing. The investment represents the belief in what we have accomplished and what we have been passionately working on these last three years in research and development. We appreciate the confidence of our investors in STRAP and strengthening our position for the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Ponmile Osibo, Partner at Platform Capital said \u201cWe are proud to partner with STRAP Technologies. Their innovative solution provides an exciting alternative for the white cane. We believe that this technology will impact millions of lives globally. We look forward to working with the STRAP team to scale and to ensure that visually impaired people can live dignified & independent lives without guides or the white cane.\u201d\n\nAbout STRAP Technologies\n\nSTRAP Technologies mission is to bring increased independence and autonomy to the visually impaired through the development of the world\u2019s first substitute for the white cane. Their featured product, STRAP, is a state-of-the-art wearable device that enables blind and visually impaired people to detect and respond to any type of obstacle and notify them of possible collisions.\n\nThe device is now available for pre-order with a limited promotional price of $500 USD. With a $50 USD deposit now, the remainder is due prior to shipping later this year.\n\nwww.strap.tech\n\nAbout Platform Capital\n\nPlatform Capital is a growth markets focused, sector agnostic, principal investment and advisory firm. We deploy patient, value accretive capital alongside international and local value investors to create champion businesses with the potential for regional or global scale.

The lawlessness, indiscipline by the ruling party has brought us to where we are.\n\n\u201cWe should not lose hope in Nigeria but focus on how to create confidence to give our people hope by managing the country well. The challenges of insecurity just show the dysfunctionality of our federal system.\n\n\u201cWe run a federation; we have three tiers of government: Federal, State and Local Governments. Why should security be exclusive to the federal level? What happened to the other two? Until we address that structural imbalance, we are not going to be able to deal with security at its core.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe country has a major problem and it\u2019s only the PDP that can help the President solve the problem but not his party. Let us as party men and Nigerians help rescue the nation and call on those that have the capacity to rescue Nigeria. Security is local and we can rescue this nation; that is why Edo is relatively peaceful.\n\n\u201cIn the South-South, we must stand up to defend ourselves economically, politically and security wise. We have pretenders in the region who try to exploit the region and we must stop them.\n\n\u201cWhen you concentrate resources at the centre, you can\u2019t get results. The security structure that we have in Nigeria has expired; we need a new security arrangement. The system that we operated till now is not tenable,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile addressing the governor earlier, Orbih said: \u201cThe South-West and South-East have both formed a security network to protect its people. As South-South, we need to look for a way to check insecurity and protect our people in the region.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to you to lead the stand for state policing. It\u2019s time to rejig the security architecture of Nigeria. We urge you to lend your voice to the struggle to make the country safe for all.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "#EndSARS: Woman, whose leg was run over by policeman, risks amputation \u2013 Surgeon",
          "text": "A surgeon at the National Orthopedic Hospital, Igbobi, Chungjoe Christopher, has told the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry that a petitioner before it stands the risk of leg cancer and amputation after her experience in the hands of the Nigerian Police.\n\nMr Christopher, who is a consultant orthopaedic and trauma surgeon, explained this to the panel on Tuesday while testifying in the case of Gloria Ezeh, a victim of police brutality.\n\nMrs Ezeh, a middle-aged woman, had earlier approached the panel and narrated how a police officer ran over her leg with a van because she could not pay N100,000 bribe demanded by the police.\n\nShe was led in evidence by her lawyer, John Nwoku, who prayed the panel to summon the orthopaedic surgeon as a witness in the matter.\n\n\u201cShe sustained a roll-over injury on the foot, there was missing bone, compromised soft tissue envelope. The tendons had to be removed,\u201d the doctor said, showing the panel pictures from a flash drive and the scan.\n\nThe petitioner, who experienced the police brutality 15 years ago, still suffers the pain of an infected leg and unequal limb because she had not accessed quality health care, the doctor explained.\n\nBackground\n\nNarrating her ordeal to the panel earlier, Mrs Ezeh said she met with the \u201cbrutal\u201d police officers on June 23, 2006, on her way back from Okokomaiko where she went to purchase products for her business.\n\nThe petitioner said she had a shop at Agric bus stop, Ikorodu, and she is a wholesaler dealing in cooking products, majorly groundnut oil.\n\n\u201cOn June 23, 2006, I was coming back from Okokomaiko where I went to buy groundnut oil for my shop. It was already late and getting to Mile 2, police arrest the driver that carried my goods and demand money from him.\u201d\n\nMrs Ezeh explained that the driver told the police he didn\u2019t have money and pleaded with the police from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m., but the officers did not listen.\n\n\u201cThe driver told me the police want to collect N100,000. I said N100,000 for what. They collected the key from the driver and said I should come out and enter their van. As I enter their van, I asked the police what is the problem and he said when I get to the station, I will know what the problem was,\u201d she said.\n\nThe petitioner said on getting to the Olodi Apapa station, the patrol officers that took them drove off and handed her to another officer, called Inspector Ayeni.\n\n\u201cThe officer still asked for N100,000. I said it is only N5,000 I have with me and he said no. I said we are going to Ikorodu and the place is far.\n\n\u201cThey said I should go away from the police station, I said it is already 12 midnight, and that they should put me inside cell to pass the night. So that I call my people to bring money in the morning.\n\nMrs Ezeh said the officer insisted that she leaves the station that midnight and she knelt down begging Mr Ayeni that Ikorodu was a far distance.\n\n\u201cWhat I just saw is that the man started the vehicle, that if I don\u2019t go away from there he will kill me. I was still pleading that he should lock me inside the cell, before I know it, he crushed my leg with the vehicle. The other man (driver) jumped, I didn\u2019t know the vehicle was near me, that was how he \u2018pieces\u2019 my leg and I was shouting,\u201d she narrated.\n\nMrs Ezeh said she was rushed to a nearby hospital but there was no one to attend to her before she was taken to another hospital where she was treated and later discharged before she went to Igbobi.\n\nDoctor explains\n\nWhile testifying in the petitioner\u2019s case on Tuesday, Mr Christopher said she was presented at Igbobi Hospital on February 26, 2007, seven months after the incident occurred.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cShe presented at Igbobi in 2007 before I started working there. She was treated by a senior colleague and all the patients of that senior colleague were passed on to me because he has retired.\n\n\u201cShe sustained a roll-over injury on the foot, there was missing bone, compromised soft tissue envelope. The tenors had to be removed,\u201d the doctor said.\n\nMr Christopher said the petitioner\u2019s tendons were also exposed and infected at the time she was brought to the hospital and to curtail the infection, the bone had to be cut off.\n\n\u201cBecause of the injury she has suffered, she has a chronic foot ulcer which does not heal. If there is indolence for 15 years, the risk of that is that it could become cancerous. She also has limb shortening as a result of bone loss.\u201d\n\nAlready 15 years since she has been going about with the condition, Mr Christopher said she has to be screened for cancer and if detected, could result in amputation of the leg.\n\nThe doctor said the uncontrolled infection the woman has caused the injury not to heal as it constantly brings out pus.\n\nAlthough her conditions could be corrected through a surgery, the doctor said the petitioner had not been able to meet up with the cost of the surgery which is about N4 to N5 million.\n\n\u201cShe requires a surgery to remove the infected tissue and perform a reconstruction. She needs bone excision to equalise limb leg. Amputation is a possibility if she is cancerous,\u201d he told the panel.\n\nDemands\n\nStating her demands, Mrs Ezeh pleaded with the panel to investigate the matter and bring the officer that caused her a lifelong injury, Mr Ayeni, to book.\n\nShe also asked the panel for a financial relief of N13 million to cater for surgery, medical treatments and other expenses she requires to correct the leg.\n\nMrs Ezeh also urged the panel to compensate her for the trauma she has suffered in the past 15 years, adding that she has been impoverished by the condition.",

Sustaining value to our shareholders remains at the core of our continuous drive and we remain committed to delivering improved profitability and higher returns in 2021 and beyond.\u201d\n\nMajor highlights of the Bank\u2019s financial performance in 2020 show that profit before tax grew by 2.8% to \u20a625.4 billion, from \u20a624.7 billion in 2019. Customer deposits also increased by 27.6% to \u20a61,131.1 billion compared to \u20a6886.3 billion in 2019, reflecting the Bank\u2019s agility in delivering a compelling range of products to its customers during the pandemic, and increased adoption of digital channels.\n\nIn addition, Non-performing loans ratio reduced to 4% from 5.8% in 2019, driven by a disciplined recoveries strategy, a more robust loan book and key restructurings to support customers during the pandemic.",

The cost and availability of this liquidity undercuts profitability for agribusinesses. Therefore, in collaboration with the LCFE, the strength of the capital markets will be brought to bear in agriculture for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe are thus making the market for commodities work in Nigeria. Beyond this, we are also supporting the Commodities Exchange as a stakeholder in its critical role to be an arbiter of transparency, integrity and supervision that provides an independent view of the ecosystem and all other market participants for healthy collaboration.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the managing director of the company, Mr Rufus Udechukwu, said, VC offers a commodities aggregation solution for agricultural commodities to key players by connecting them together via technology driven solutions to facilitate seamless transactions.",

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nGovernor Rolls Out Medical Infrastructure Upgrade\n\nLagos State Government has embarked on a total overhaul of infrastructure across all levels of its healthcare delivery system. Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi broke the news at the ongoing inter-ministerial press briefing organised to mark the second year anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in office.\n\nThe Commissioner said the roadmap for the upgrade of infrastructure in the State-owned health facilities began last year, following the approval of the plan by the executive council.\n\nAt the event held at the Press Centre in Alausa, Abayomi also gave account of stewardship of the Ministry\u2019s activities in the last two year.\n\nThe Commissioner explained that the infrastructure roadmap was being executed by the ministry\u2019s Medical Project Implementation Unit (MPIU) in phases, revamping facilities across primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare. He said the overhaul was part of strategy to build a resilient healthcare in Lagos and increase residents\u2019 access to quality universal health coverage.\n\nAbayomi said the effort would bring about fit-for-purpose healthcare facilities that would raise the capacity of the State Government to respond to contemporary and future health challenges, while observing that the renewal effort was being carried out in short, medium- and long-term bases.\n\nPart of the new features to be seen, the Commissioner said, will include improved efficiency for physical maintenance, ease of movement, low carbon footprint,\n\nlow energy consumption, infection prevention and control as well as staff and patient comfort.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn last one year, we have embarked on phased but comprehensive revamp of our secondary health facilities as part of our medical infrastructure upgrade roadmap which is aimed at raising access to quality and bring about efficiently run health facilities. This effort commenced in the previous year and it is expected to address issues of design errors, drainage, patient flow, staff flow, water collection, infection prevention, energy and ventilations.\n\n\u201cWe have renovated and remodeled the Mainland Hospital in Yaba with future plans of making it an Institute of Research for Infectious Disease. We have also completed the remodeling and upgraded of Apapa General Hospital, just as we currently renovate Harvey Road Health Centre, Ebute Metta Health Centre, Isolo General Hospital and the General Hospital, Odan Lagos. All of these are in the effort to make health accessible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Commissioner, the Sanwo-Olu administration has completed, equipped and handed over two multi-level Maternal and Childcare Centre (MCC) in Eti-Osa and Badagry. The construction of another 110-bed MCC, he said, has been completed in Epe and is due for commissioning in the coming weeks.\n\nAbayomi noted that the upgrade was being done in a sustainable way, which would take another decade for major repairs to be done, except statutory maintenance by the hospital management and the Lagos State Asset Maintenance Agency (LASIAMA).\n\nHe disclosed executive council had also approved the construction of new hospital to bridge gaps in access and services in health sector. This, he said, is in tandem with the determination of current administration to achieve the goals set in the Health and Environment pillar of its T.H.E.M.E.S agenda.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn fulfilment of our medical infrastructure blueprint agenda, we have commenced the construction of a 280-bed General Hospital in Ojo, 150-bed New Massey Street Children\u2019s Hospital, while the Governor has also approved the construction and equipping of 1,500-bed Psychiatric Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre at Majidun in Ketu Ejinrin.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the year, we have completed the construction of a four-storey Faculty of Basic Medical and Clinical Sciences Office Block at Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM) and plans have been concluded for renovation and upgrade of some facilities at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in tandem with our medical infrastructure blueprint strategy for the tertiary health facilities.\n\n\u201cIn partnership with the private sector, we have completed and handed over an oxygen plant at Mainland and Gbagada General Hospitals. We have delivered Traige and Oxygen Centres in 10 locations across Lagos. In raising staff welfare, we have started the construction of a 24-unit Doctors\u2019 and Staff Quarters in at Gbagada General Hospital.\u201d\n\nAbayomi also disclosed that work had begun on the blueprint designs for Comprehensive Health Center, Primary Health Center and Health Posts as part of the move to rejig their operations and service delivery. This, he said, will help in adding significant bed capacity to Lagos State\u2019s healthcare infrastructure.\n\nWhile noting that the promotion and protection of the health of residents of Lagos State has a positive impact on social development and quality of life of citizens, Abayomi disclosed that the State government embarked on the greenfield medical infrastructure projects to prevent issues noticed in health infrastructure across all levels of care in the State. He added that all issues bedeviling medical health infrastructure will disappear when the medical infrastructure blueprint strategy is fully implemented.\n\n\u201cThe continuous improvement in quality of health service in the State is a core mandate of our administration and we are uniquely positioned to utilize available resources to actualize this goal. With the ongoing refurbishment and roll out of new infrastructure blueprint, the medical infrastructure landscape of the State would look completely different, giving us a step closer to achieving universal health coverage\u201d, he stated.\n\nHe averred that medical infrastructure blueprint agenda will help address the issue of brain drain, medical travels and patient welfare stressing that the State government through the strategy hoped to endear medical tourism to the State.\n\n\u201cThe prototype of the new, remodeled and upgraded healthcare infrastructure in the state will conform with key elements of global standards health facility designs which includes Natural Light/Ventilation, Sustainable Energy, Patient Flow, Infection Prevention, Noise Prevention, Flood Prevention, Identifiable standout visual features as well as scalability and modular design for expansion\u201d, Abayomi stated.\n\nThe second wave of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), which spread more rapidly across Lagos State than the first wave, would have wreaked havoc on the country, the Commissioner said.

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nGovernor Rolls Out Medical Infrastructure Upgrade\n\nLagos State Government has embarked on a total overhaul of infrastructure across all levels of its healthcare delivery system. Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi broke the news at the ongoing inter-ministerial press briefing organised to mark the second year anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in office.\n\nThe Commissioner said the roadmap for the upgrade of infrastructure in the State-owned health facilities began last year, following the approval of the plan by the executive council.\n\nAt the event held at the Press Centre in Alausa, Abayomi also gave account of stewardship of the Ministry\u2019s activities in the last two year.\n\nThe Commissioner explained that the infrastructure roadmap was being executed by the ministry\u2019s Medical Project Implementation Unit (MPIU) in phases, revamping facilities across primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare. He said the overhaul was part of strategy to build a resilient healthcare in Lagos and increase residents\u2019 access to quality universal health coverage.\n\nAbayomi said the effort would bring about fit-for-purpose healthcare facilities that would raise the capacity of the State Government to respond to contemporary and future health challenges, while observing that the renewal effort was being carried out in short, medium- and long-term bases.\n\nPart of the new features to be seen, the Commissioner said, will include improved efficiency for physical maintenance, ease of movement, low carbon footprint,\n\nlow energy consumption, infection prevention and control as well as staff and patient comfort.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn last one year, we have embarked on phased but comprehensive revamp of our secondary health facilities as part of our medical infrastructure upgrade roadmap which is aimed at raising access to quality and bring about efficiently run health facilities. This effort commenced in the previous year and it is expected to address issues of design errors, drainage, patient flow, staff flow, water collection, infection prevention, energy and ventilations.\n\n\u201cWe have renovated and remodeled the Mainland Hospital in Yaba with future plans of making it an Institute of Research for Infectious Disease. We have also completed the remodeling and upgraded of Apapa General Hospital, just as we currently renovate Harvey Road Health Centre, Ebute Metta Health Centre, Isolo General Hospital and the General Hospital, Odan Lagos. All of these are in the effort to make health accessible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Commissioner, the Sanwo-Olu administration has completed, equipped and handed over two multi-level Maternal and Childcare Centre (MCC) in Eti-Osa and Badagry. The construction of another 110-bed MCC, he said, has been completed in Epe and is due for commissioning in the coming weeks.\n\nAbayomi noted that the upgrade was being done in a sustainable way, which would take another decade for major repairs to be done, except statutory maintenance by the hospital management and the Lagos State Asset Maintenance Agency (LASIAMA).\n\nHe disclosed executive council had also approved the construction of new hospital to bridge gaps in access and services in health sector. This, he said, is in tandem with the determination of current administration to achieve the goals set in the Health and Environment pillar of its T.H.E.M.E.S agenda.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn fulfilment of our medical infrastructure blueprint agenda, we have commenced the construction of a 280-bed General Hospital in Ojo, 150-bed New Massey Street Children\u2019s Hospital, while the Governor has also approved the construction and equipping of 1,500-bed Psychiatric Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre at Majidun in Ketu Ejinrin.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the year, we have completed the construction of a four-storey Faculty of Basic Medical and Clinical Sciences Office Block at Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM) and plans have been concluded for renovation and upgrade of some facilities at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) in tandem with our medical infrastructure blueprint strategy for the tertiary health facilities.\n\n\u201cIn partnership with the private sector, we have completed and handed over an oxygen plant at Mainland and Gbagada General Hospitals. We have delivered Traige and Oxygen Centres in 10 locations across Lagos. In raising staff welfare, we have started the construction of a 24-unit Doctors\u2019 and Staff Quarters in at Gbagada General Hospital.\u201d\n\nAbayomi also disclosed that work had begun on the blueprint designs for Comprehensive Health Center, Primary Health Center and Health Posts as part of the move to rejig their operations and service delivery. This, he said, will help in adding significant bed capacity to Lagos State\u2019s healthcare infrastructure.\n\nWhile noting that the promotion and protection of the health of residents of Lagos State has a positive impact on social development and quality of life of citizens, Abayomi disclosed that the State government embarked on the greenfield medical infrastructure projects to prevent issues noticed in health infrastructure across all levels of care in the State. He added that all issues bedeviling medical health infrastructure will disappear when the medical infrastructure blueprint strategy is fully implemented.\n\n\u201cThe continuous improvement in quality of health service in the State is a core mandate of our administration and we are uniquely positioned to utilize available resources to actualize this goal. With the ongoing refurbishment and roll out of new infrastructure blueprint, the medical infrastructure landscape of the State would look completely different, giving us a step closer to achieving universal health coverage\u201d, he stated.\n\nHe averred that medical infrastructure blueprint agenda will help address the issue of brain drain, medical travels and patient welfare stressing that the State government through the strategy hoped to endear medical tourism to the State.\n\n\u201cThe prototype of the new, remodeled and upgraded healthcare infrastructure in the state will conform with key elements of global standards health facility designs which includes Natural Light/Ventilation, Sustainable Energy, Patient Flow, Infection Prevention, Noise Prevention, Flood Prevention, Identifiable standout visual features as well as scalability and modular design for expansion\u201d, Abayomi stated.\n\nThe second wave of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), which spread more rapidly across Lagos State than the first wave, would have wreaked havoc on the country, the Commissioner said. He said the response strategy put in place by the Governor efficiently curtailed the pandemic and limited fatalities.\n\nThe Commissioner said the effectiveness of the State\u2019s response strategy saved the country from negative impacts associated with the pandemic\u2019s second wave as seen in other countries. He added that EKO TELEMED \u2013 a tech-driven platform through which the State Government managed the spread of the virus \u2013 yielded efficient results in breaking the cycle of community infection.\n\nThe Commissioner said there was an ongoing effort by the State Government to prevent third wave of the pandemic, noting that Lagos had started the deployment of EKO TELEMED in the management of in-bound international travellers from high burdened countries. The tech-driven platform, he said, would be used to monitor movement and treat infected travelers.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "May 3, 2021 597\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.",

          "text": "April 29, 2021 576\n\nPort users, commuters and other motorists are currently groaning over the worsening gridlock on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway and along the Marine Bridge, Ijora, as trailers and tanker drivers have taken over these routes despite the implementation of the electronic call-up system by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock. Under the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\n\nHowever, two months into the implementation of the new system, there seems to be no end in sight to the intractable gridlock with NPA and Lagos State Government appearing helpless as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately on the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some truck drivers, due to the alleged slow process in booking of trucks by the Truck Transit Park (TTP), the company managing the eto application, have abandoned the designated parks to remain on the roads and bridges where they bribe their way into the port with fake e-call up slip in connivance with security personnel deployed to manage the gridlock.\n\nThe action by these truck drivers, coupled with the poor access roads and ongoing construction along the Mile Two-Tin Can Island Port road, has compounded the gridlock as motorists spent several hours trying to get into Apapa yesterday.\n\nAll the major roads into Apapa were completely taken over by trucks and petroleum tankers yesterday. The traffic stretched to other major highways including Eko Bridge and Ikorodu Road.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Directs NSCDC To Collaborate With Other Agencies To Prevent Attacks At Airports\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Stanley Ezenga, said there has not been any respite on the road despite the e-call up system, which he said has become a money-making venture for some people benefiting from the situation.\n\nHe said the traffic situation persists due to poor access roads and the failure of the government to prevail on the contractor handling the construction of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to expedite action.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature. The e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it. For each call up, trucks pay N10,000 but this is just the official money. They still part with other money being given to security operatives before they get to the port.\n\n\u201cSo who is fooling who? From the onset, I know there will be issues with the e-call up because the main issue that has to do with the gridlock coupled with the state of the road has not been addressed. You can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Navy, created a task force but the gridlock has negated all of them. The e-call up is not working. That is why the gridlock is still there. It is the same road the trucks will pass when they are called and when they are not called upon and yet the issues that made them to be on the road have not been addressed.\u201d",

          "text": "April 29, 2021 450\n\nA week is a week. This is almost true in every part of the world regardless of the season. Every week is also unique. The activities, the happenings, and the stories define each week.\n\n*This week has been epoch-making in every sense. This week, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd. The verdict was unanimous. He was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for over 9mins. George in pleading for his life kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Philonise Floyd, George\u2019s brother said that he\u2019s \u201cable to breathe again\u201d.\n\nThe feeling of relief was widespread. It was a sigh of relief heard around the world. We can all breathe again.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government lifted the ban on sales of SIM cards.\n\nOfficially, it meant that the telcos could resume sales of SIM cards after months of suspension. The sector and indeed Nigerian telecom services consumers were able to breathe again.\n\nDuring the ban, countless people who had lost their phones or damaged their SIM cards couldn\u2019t retrieve them. Visitors to the country couldn\u2019t get SIMs and businesses that depended on SIM card sales suffered. Millions were thrown out of jobs, sales outlets shut down and operators lost revenue. The last five months were a real chokehold on the telecommunications industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Employment Statistics: World Bank, FG To Discuss Modalities Of Data Collection\n\nConservatives reports indicate that the number of connected lines dropped by over 10 million lines. Think, loss in revenue to the telecom services providers and endless pain for the customers who couldn\u2019t connect with family, friends, or business. It was a chokehold.\n\nNo wonder the sector couldn\u2019t breathe. Little wonder the economy recorded a rise in the number of unemployed and more citizens dropped into the poverty zone. The country couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nSince nature abhors a vacuum, it didn\u2019t take long for illegal sales of pre-registered SIMs to gain ground. This is a story for another week.\n\nThe biggest loss was that the objective was lost to all but the initiators. It was a chokehold on the economy, Nigerians couldn\u2019t breathe and nobody knew why.\n\nFirst, a little context. The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, had in December 2020 ordered the suspension of the sales and activation of new SIM cards across all phone networks in the country. Through the NCC, he directed Nigerians to ensure that their phone lines were connected to their National Identification Numbers (NIN) or risk losing the lines.\n\nNow, the suspension was expected, at the time, to last till the completion of the NIN registration. The date fixed was early January.\n\nExperts swore that it was an impossible mission. For in a decade, the NIMC registered less than 50 million people, how can the same organization be reasonably expected to sign on over 50 million people in under six weeks? The experts were right.\n\nSo, it was no surprise therefore that the deadlines had to be shifted repeatedly. The humongous crowd at the registration centres made Nigerians criticised the government for not making adequate provisions before the directive went into effect.\n\nBanning SIM sales precipitated what appears to be several unintended consequences. The number of internet subscribers dropped, no doubt, limiting the chance of meeting the NCC set broadband target.\n\nIn these days of reducing average revenue per user (ARPU), it is a case of declining revenue for the operators.\n\nWhile telcos can\u2019t be expected to complain openly, the impact was an open wound. It was visible for all to see.\n\nThe pain is equally real. Job loss. Revenue loss.\n\nAt a time, when the economy is witnessing diminishing revenues, these losses also mean a reduction in taxes payable to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the government\u2019s actions with its regulations. The situation is typical. The telecommunications industry is making massive contributions to the GDP, yet it was placed in a chokehold and left struggling to breathe.\n\nThankfully, this week, the sector can breathe again. Yes, Nigerians can breathe again.\n\nDarnella Frazier, the teenager whose viral video of George Floyd\u2019s murder helped the case, has been praised for her bravery. It would also be proper to laud all the analysts and writers who pushed tirelessly for the resumption of SIM sales in Nigeria.\n\nElvis Eromosele, a Corporate Communication professional and public affairs analyst lives in Lagos\n\n* Article was written a week prior publication.",
