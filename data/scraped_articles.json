          "text": "The minority caucus in the National Assembly is billed to commence actions against the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as lawmakers resume from Sallah break on Tuesday, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers, who are majorly of the Peoples Democratic Party, are in the final stages in the move against Buhari over his alleged leadership failures.\n\nA prominent member of the caucus in the House of Representatives told our correspondent on Friday that the lawmakers would strike at a \u201ccritical\u201d time.\n\nThe lawmakers in the minority are compiling the President\u2019s alleged infractions, which they would use against him at the appropriate time.\n\nThe member of the House from the South-South geopolitical zone, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, stated that Nigerians already knew what Buhari\u2019s offences were.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are still compiling the list; there is no need to let the details out at this stage. We have not compiled all. And they (offences) are very obvious that even he knows.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the actions to be taken against the President, the lawmaker said, \u201cI won\u2019t disclose that. We have mentioned a bit of it. We are waiting for the critical time to take the action.\u201d\n\nThe caucus had on May 5, 2021, threatened to use its legislative powers to move against the President should he continue to breach the Constitution.\n\nThe Minority Leader of Senate and leader of the caucus, Enyinnaya Abaribe, after a closed-door meeting, had said the opposition lawmakers were saddened that Buhari had failed to guarantee the security and welfare of Nigerians, which he described as the primary purpose of government.\n\nThe caucus also expressed disappointment that the current regime had mismanaged the economy to the point of near collapse.\n\nThis, Abaribe said, should not be allowed to continue.\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent, the House member alleged that members of the ruling All Progressives Congress were also lamenting the crises in the country.\n\n\u201cBut when we want to talk (criticise the regime), they will say no; they will be defending Buhari. They should wait longer. Remember the Kwara State Governor (AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq); imagine the backlash that followed when he tried to defend Buhari,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, some members of the PDP caucus in the House have denied knowledge of the threats against Buhari.\n\nSeveral of them, who were contacted by our correspondent, said they were neither at the caucus meeting nor at the press conference that followed.\n\nOthers, however, kept mum on their plans.\n\nA ranking member of the House from Delta State, Nicholas Ossai, said, \u201cPlease, my brother, I\u2019m not in the know of the above issues. Please remain safe in Jesus Christ\u2019 name. Amen.\u201d\n\nAnother ranking member from Osun State, Oluwole Oke, dismissed the threat by his caucus.\n\nAnother member from Rivers State, Solomon Bob, said, \u201cI\u2019m not yet briefed on the meeting because I was unavoidably absent.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Onofiok Luke from Akwa Ibom said only the leadership of the caucus should speak on the matter.\n\nWhen contacted to react to the threat, the Chairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Benjamin Kalu, asked the opposition lawmakers to instead approach the Houses of Assembly of their respective states to move against the governors.\n\n\u201cPress briefing is different from parliamentary debate; we are prepared and waiting for their presentation after the compilation you referred to. This is not really the time to play to the gallery,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The UN had never been fair in its dealings with Palestine,\u201d MURIC added.\n\nThe Islamic rights group said it was particularly disenchanted with the role of the US in the ongoing crisis, noting that America allows Israel to build a nuclear weapon but hypocritically breathes down the neck of Israel\u2019s neighbours on the issue of nuclear energy, adding that the US has the power to stop Israel\u2019s aggression against Palestine.\n\nIn a statement signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola and made available to DAILY POST on Monday, MURIC added, \u201cThat is why we condemn in the strongest terms the statement made by President Joe Biden that Israel has the right to defend itself. That statement was reckless and irresponsible\u2026 \u201d\n\nMURIC also blamed former Nigerian President, Jonathan for the ongoing Israeli aggression against Palestine, accusing him of refusing to recognise Palestine as a state in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven Nigeria under ex-President Goodluck Jonathan played an ignoble role in the Palestinian question. The request to officially recognize Palestine as a state within the 1967 boarders with full UN member benefits and state status throughout the international community was presented by Jordan on 30th December 2014.\n\n\u201cWhile justice-seeking countries like Argentina, Chad, Chile, Jordan, China, France and Russia voted \u2018Yes\u2019 to a Palestinian State, Nigeria dashed the hope of Palestine by abstaining.\n\n\u201cJust nine votes were mandatory for Palestine to secure the status it needed and eight had been obtained. Only one more vote was needed but Nigeria reneged on its well-known anti-apartheid stance. It was a shocking, conservative and reactionary shift from anti-apartheid champion status for which the country was known to a pro-zionist entity. It was the coup de grace.\n\n\u201cIt was the day Nigeria shamefully turned its back on its principles of justice, liberty and humanity, no thanks to ex-President Jonathan\u2019s love for anything that may hurt Muslims and favour Christians. Jonathan cannot wash his hands off that diplomatic misadventure. He allowed his religious sentiment to get the better of him.\u201d\n\nOver 65 Palestinians and 6 people from Israel have been killed as the deadly exchange of fire between Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli military escalates significantly.\n\nThe United Nations said it fears a \u201cfull-scale war\u201d as Isael accuses Palestinian militants of having fired more than 1,000 rockets.\n\nIsrael has also carried out hundreds of air strikes on Gaza leading to destruction of three tower blocks and killing of senior Hamas officials.\n\nOver sixteen Palestinian children have been caught up in the conflict.\n\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by the ongoing violence.",

          "title": "Israel kills 42 in Gaza as Netanyahu warns war will go on",
          "text": "Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed no fewer than 42 people yesterday, Palestinian medics said.\n\nDespite the heavy death toll and international efforts to broker a cease-fire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fourth war with Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers would rage on.\n\nNetanyahu, in a televised address yesterday, said the attacks were continuing at \u201cfull-force\u201d and will \u201ctake time.\u201d\n\nIsrael \u201cwants to levy a heavy price\u201d from the Hamas militant group, he said. He was flanked by his defence minister and political rival Benny Gantz in a show of unity.\n\nSince violence flared last Monday, at least 188 Palestinians, including 55 children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip. More than 1,200 others have been wounded. In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have killed at least 13 Palestinians.\n\nIsrael has reported 10 dead, including two children, from the thousands of missiles fired from Gaza by Hamas and other Palestinian groups, many of which were intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air defence system.\n\nThe Israeli air assault early yesterday was the deadliest single attack, marking the worst fighting since their devastating 2014 war in Gaza.\n\nThe airstrikes hit a major downtown street of residential buildings and storefronts over the course of five minutes after midnight, destroying two adjacent buildings and one about 50 yards (meters) down the road.\n\nAt one point, a rescuer shouted, \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d into a hole in the rubble. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d Minutes later, first responders pulled a survivor out and carried him off on an orange stretcher. The Gaza Health Ministry said 16 women and 10 children were among those killed, with more than 50 people wounded, and rescue efforts are still underway.\n\nEarlier, the Israeli military said it destroyed the home of Gaza\u2019s top Hamas leader, Yahiyeh Sinwar, in a separate strike in the southern town of Khan Younis. It was the third such attack in the last two days on the homes of senior Hamas leaders, who have gone underground.\n\nIsrael appeared to have stepped up strikes in recent days to inflict as much damage as possible on Hamas as international mediators work to end the fighting and stave off an Israeli ground invasion in Gaza.\n\nBut targeting the group\u2019s leaders could hinder those efforts. A United States (U.S.) diplomat has been deployed in the region to de-escalate tensions. The United Nations (UN) Security Council was also meeting yesterday.\n\nIn its airstrikes, Israel has leveled a number of Gaza City\u2019s tallest office and residential buildings, alleging they contain Hamas military infrastructure. Among them was the building housing The Associated Press office and those of other media outlets.\n\nThe latest violence broke out in east Jerusalem last month, when Palestinian clashed with police in response to Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers.\n\nA focal point of clashes was the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint that is located on a hilltop compound that is revered by both Muslims and Jews.\n\nHamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem last Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on impoverished Gaza, which is home to more than two million Palestinians and has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.\n\nSpeaking alongside Netanyahu yesterday, Israel\u2019s military chief, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi, said Hamas did not anticipate Israel\u2019s overwhelming response to its rocket fire. \u201cHamas made a serious and grave mistake and didn\u2019t read us properly.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil has spilled over, fueling protests in the occupied West Bank and stoking violence within Israel between its Jewish and Arab citizens, with clashes and vigilante attacks on people and property.\n\nYesterday, a driver rammed into an Israeli checkpoint in the east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah \u2014 where the Palestinian families had been threatened with eviction \u2014 injuring six officers before police shot and killed the attacker, Israeli police said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe violence also sparked pro-Palestinian protests in cities across Europe and the United States, with French police firing tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators in Paris.\n\nHowever, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire, saying in his address to the council that hostilities between the two parties were \u201cutterly appalling\u201d and urging them to \u201callow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed\u201d.\n\nThe UN Security Council (UNSC) had privately met twice last week over the worsening violence, but has so far been unable to agree on a public statement because the US \u2013 a strong ally of Israel \u2013 did not believe it would be helpful, diplomats said.\n\nChina voiced regret that the U.S. has blocked a UNSC statement on Israeli-Palestinian violence as it urged greater international efforts to stop the bloodshed.\n\n\u201cWe call upon the U.S. to shoulder its responsibilities, take a just position, and together with most of the international community support the Security Council in easing the situation,\u201d said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who chaired Yesterday\u2019s meeting as China is council president for May.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigerians should expect an increase in the pump price of Premium Motor Spirt (PMS), popularly called petrol anytime soon as the Petroleum Equalisation Fund(PEF), has concluded plans to increase petroleum transportation pricing template from N3.89k per litre to N9.11k, Daily Sun investigation has revealed.\n\nBut the Executive Secretary of PEF, Mr. Ahmed Bobboi, said the pricing template was delayed due to ongoing negotiations between labour and government.\n\nUnder the National Transportation Code(NTA) supervised by PEF, an organ of the Ministry of Petroleum, collections and claims settlement under NTA is mainly collected from two kinds of product transactions; Bridged products and Local transactions.\n\nNTA) on Bridged products are deducted at source from Marketers that are within Zone 1 and 2 (Claim Zone); while those within Zone 3-9 (Contribution Zone), are reimbursed for both the NTA and Bridging elements of their transactions.\n\nAn industry source who pleaded anonymity because of the political nature of PEF and fear of victimisation said should PEF increase NTA, price of fuel will increase. The source who lamented that PEF was a scam said that those that are meant to be contributing to PEF fund in zone 1 and 2 were not doing so, while those that are filling claims for zones 3-9 were not actually landing products at those locations.\n\nData from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC) shows that the North West region consumed more volume of petrol at 985,974,850 litres in QI 2020 compared to the Southeast region with 599,821,058 litres within the same period\n\nThe source said the idea of PEF was meant to stabilise petroleum product prices across the country, so that prices are not at variance from one location to the other.\n\n\u2018\u2018But the irony is that prices of petrol across the country have never been the same. The price you buy a litre of petrol in Enugu is not the same as Yobe. And this is what PEF meant to address. You will find that that those that were meant to transport petrol to Maiduguri, actually sell same in Lagos but make transport claim for same under a Maiduguri depot.\n\n\u201cThey forge documents and get the delivery papers signed to show that the products were actually delivered at Maiduguri. So over time, those that are supposed to be contributing to the fund in zones 1 and 2 were not fully complying and this created funding challenges for PEF that those they were meant to be reimbursed could not get it due to funding constraints.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe source added that those in zone 1 and 2 were the ones funding the fuel cost for those in very far location.\n\nHe added that this a practice that should be discouraged because it is fraud and should not have had a place if the sector have been deregulated.\n\n\u2018\u2018Technically, this is another form of subsidy. Nobody subsidies the cost of cows, goats, beans pepper and onions that are brought from the Northern part of the country to Lagos. The price you get these items in the North is different from that of Lagos.\n\nTo make matters worse, larger chunk of the petroleum products that PEF is subsiding, eventually finds its way to other neighboring countries which included; Niger, Chad, among others.",

They commended southern governors for coming together to speak with one voice, saying that their resolutions were pathways to resolving the problems facing the country.\n\nThe speakers\u2019 communique read: \u201cWe, the speakers of state legislatures in Southern Nigeria, commend the governors of the southern states for their patriotism and firm belief in the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cWe salute the governors for their initiative and restate our support for their positions. We wish to state, unequivocally, that the issues canvassed in the communique are neither new nor strange, rather they require swift response from the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe country is currently undergoing very challenging times and requires bold and audacious measures to stop it from sliding into abyss.\n\n\u201cWe maintain that the positions of the governors, ascontained in the communique issued on May 11, 2021, in Asaba, are sacrosanct and a guarantee for justice, fairness and equity in the country.We adopt all the positions in the communique and reiterate the call for the ban on open grazing of cattle in the south. We support the call for the restructuring of the country to enthrone true federalism and, therefore, the convocation of a national dialogue is inevitable.That this will afford stakeholders from all parts of the country to table their prejudices and, together, work out a sustainable relationship as one indivisible country.\u201d",

          "title": "Why elections may not hold in 2023 \u2013Bode George",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer national Vice Chairman of the South West zone of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Olabode George has expressed fears over the future of the country and the 2023 general elections. He said if insecurity persists and if the President does not assent to the Electoral bill which should include electronic voting, then the election may not hold. In this interview, he spoke on various issues.\n\nPastor Paul Adefarasin advised his congregation and Nigerians to look for alternative route because of economic hardship and insecurity across the country. Do you agree that every Nigerian should have a plan B?\n\nIf your house if leaking, do you abandon the house and go somewhere else and you think you have succour there? If your house is leaking, as a committed and loyal member of that household, you will stay and repair it. Is there any part of the world today that is not in crises? Let men of valour and principles rise up to defend and rebuild because running way won\u2019t solve the issue.\n\nRemember what we did to Ghanaians? They came here for succour and were very useful in education, teaching our people, doing bricklaying and all those artisan jobs they were involved in. Suddenly, the government at that time said Ghana must go and they shipped them out in lorries. Who tells you that that will not happen? With our population, anywhere we surge into becomes Nigeria and you think those people love us? That giant of Africa called Nigeria, what happened to it? The present generation collapsed the system. If you send your houseboy on an errand to buy something for you, he will want to cut corners. Even those selling food stuffs at the market are not different. So, cheating has become a national sport. I believe that the devil found a home in Nigeria and he is spreading like cancer. We must go back to God genuinely and pray for Him to forgive us our sins.Nigeria is in dire straits, so running away will not solve the issue. You want to run to America? They have crisis now. You want to go to England and you think they don\u2019t have their own problems?\n\nOn the issue of security, Southern Governors recently converged on Asaba and unanimously banned open grazing in their respective states and called for restriction, a piece of advice that was derided by the Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives who told them to restructure their own states first. Where do you stand on this?\n\nI am totally in support of the governors because it is our system of governance that gave rise to these problems. We have distanced government from the people. What we have today is a military organisation. The military handed our constitution to us and for more than 20 years, we have been trying it but it is not working. The Senate president and the speaker are holding opposing views to what the governors said but are they really impacting on the lives of those at the bottom? The statement of Lawan and Gbajabiamila is very demeaning. Let them come down from their high horses and know that someday, they are going to come back and report to their constituency. If genuinely they were elected, do you think they will be talking like this?\n\nDevolution of power means reducing the power at the Centre and giving more powers to the states so that they can impact positively on the people that elected them. Why do we need that massive number of lawmakers in the National Assembly? You know how much money that is costing this country? Nigerian senators earn more than American senators. If you convert our own to dollars, they earn more here than Americans. Is that not a joke?\n\nDon\u2019t you think that the statement of the governors makes it appear as if the South is now united against the North?\n\nThe agitation today in this country is national, so let\u2019s forget about tribe now. You think the Northern people are not suffering? The economic and social situation in the North is worse than in the South. The governors didn\u2019t say in their communiqu\u00e9 that they are going to start asking for devolution of Nigeria. Open grazing for instance should be done as it is done in those other civilised countries. What is wrong in that? We have had Southern presidents; today we have a Northern president, and tomorrow we might have a Southern president. Is it a matter of your areas alone? What they said is not wrong. It is an observation and a suggested solution.\n\nYou are one of the founders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). What is the state of your party right now?\n\nIt will be incorrect for me to X-ray our party publicly but I will just tell you that all is not well and that is why the APC is gallivanting and having a lot of fun because there are no challenges from the opposition. It is like we are dead men walking. I won\u2019t go deeper than that because it will be self-inflicted on our personalities. But we are not yet ready.\n\nYou once said that if the APC zones the presidency to the South, the PDP should also zone theirs to the South, otherwise the country would be more divided. Do you still hold that view?\n\nIn fact, if we try that now, it will be suicide because the scenarios now are so bad. The ethnic tensions have worsened. Look at what is happening in Oyo, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo and Lagos also now. So we need the usual practice, which is for the party to get to that round table and debate on the issue.\n\nAt a time, some people were pushing for you to contest for the presidency. If the PDP zones the presidency to the south, would you be interested?\n\nYou know in two years I will be 78 years old. Joe Biden is the President of the US and because of the state of the country, he said he was going to run because America was veering away from the norm, so why not do a very short run to get back on track, then others can continue. Collectively, we must pull and push and carry the load of this nation so that the future generations too will say this is what our fathers did and we must continue in them. Otherwise when some people build, some others will come and destroy it.\n\nMany people have expressed fears that if the insecurity situation worsens, there may not be a 2023 election. What is your view?\n\nI also have that fear. Who would you go out to campaign to? When you do, they will ask you the votes we had that time, what has become of it? So like I said a couple of weeks ago, I am appealing to the President to call a round table; one, to give a good name to our profession \u2013 the military. This month will be exactly two years to 2023. So, we have effectively one year to revisit this anomaly. If he comes down to look at it passionately, honestly and sincerely, with God on our side, it is still possible because this system is not working.\n\nThe report from the 2014 National Conference has been submitted; they either add to it or subtract from it, but that is a starting point. We are not saying dissolve Nigeria, no. Let the system we are going to run make more sense so that it can positively impact on the people. What we are doing now is not working but the President can turn things around within one year. That report is very cogent. I was part of it, I saw it and read it and it is still very relevant.\n\nLocal Government elections are coming up in Lagos in two months\u2019 time and PDP doesn\u2019t seem to be on ground and it seems that you have decided not to be part of the system. How are you going to save the party in Lagos?\n\nThe managers from national executive came and imposed their own choice on the people in Lagos but you cannot know my house more than me. For example, they say I am the leader but do I jump into their local governments to tell them to choose this man as chairman or that man as chairman? No. I can\u2019t know their local government more than them.\n\nYou are talking of local government elections, and we are even complaining about the national elections. Is this the way to do an election, in a modern day when people are physically carrying results from point A to point B? When people don\u2019t turn out, it means they are fed up. Lagosians are tired of these antics, they are tired of the theft that is going on. They think we don\u2019t know who owns Alpha Beta? Where else in the world have you seen that they have the Inland Revenue staff and you set up a company who will now be collecting tax on behalf of the government. What is the job of the Inland Revenue staff? And you take a certain percentage. First of all, they pay into Alfa Beta Company\u2019s account and then they deduct from source and hand over the balance but one day, there will be a day of reckoning\n\nYou seem to always go very hard on former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu. Is there a score to settle between you?\n\nHow and which score? You know I am from Lagos Island. When you go home, you see those boys and girls jobless, you see the state of the schools, and you wonder what is going on. But when you know that the financial resources are very heavily available and one man in one year takes billions from our coffers, think of how many children that will benefit from that if it was used in the state. But he is there sitting. He is the one who appoints who will be chairman, speaker, are we running an emperor system? I have absolutely nothing personal between me and him. If for example he has factories, you will know how he is making his money .\n\nWhat if he emerges the presidential candidate for APC?\n\nLet them put him forward then we will campaign to the people, they will hear. If we continue the manipulation of the system with the money, didn\u2019t you see what happened during the last election with the bullion van? Was it carrying food or carrying drinks to his house? These are the issues building up these time bombs in Nigeria. People may not talk but they are building up the anger in them. You think they are not watching and because they haven\u2019t gone on the streets you think all is alright? No. they are not happy. Who the hell is this boy appropriating all the resources of the people? Things that they should use to benefit the people? That leads me also to the system of the electoral process. Is the rubbish we are doing an election? If the people cannot have an impact why are you saying you are running a democratic dispensation? It is their votes that keep you there.\n\nIf Lagosians are not happy as you claim, why are they not revolting?\n\nWhat can they do? Even the elections when you vote against them, they manipulate the results because it is manually done. Even if there is only one voice shouting in the wilderness, it\u2019s okay. The problem is that there are some of our elders who have shared the money with him but they think we don\u2019t know them. They connive with him instead of telling him the truth. He is from Osun State and you think Lagosians are stupid.\n\nWhat is your thought on INEC as we go into 2023?\n\nIf we do not go modern, then it is a joke. We are just groping in the dark because I know that the INEC chairman has been struggling. The President should sign the electoral bill; that is when you will know the facts. We need to start electronic voting and in fact, there are young Nigerians who can write the software. Look at people on the riverine areas, during elections, they will wait in the collation center in Abuja for results from those areas and you see INEC officials physically carrying results. If they don\u2019t stop manual voting, someday it will blow up this country. Whatever they want to do, we have exactly two years to do it, otherwise it is a joke and waste of time.\n\nOne of the most brilliant things that this country has done was the free zones, to allow companies to come in to the free zones so that the encumbrances like unnecessary taxation, bottlenecks, bureaucracies will not be there, so that, that is an incentive for people to come. Agencies of government now go to those free zones to harass them. Look at Ghana, they copied the free trade zone from us and they now have a $130 billion cocoa manufacturing company there.",

          "title": "Eight Southern States Set to Enact Anti-Open Grazing Law",
          "text": "\u2022Ekiti, Abia, Ebonyi, Oyo, Bayelsa face implementation challenges\n\n\u2022Southern speakers, Ohanaeze back 17 govs\u2019 resolutions\n\nOur Reporters\n\nFollowing the resolution of the 17 governors of the Southern states banning open grazing of cattle in the three geopolitical zones in the South, no fewer than eight states are now set to enact anti-open grazing law to give legislative backing to the governors\u2019 pronouncement, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed.\n\nSome of these states include: Akwa Ibom, Ondo, Enugu, Edo, Imo, Ogun, Delta and Anambra,\n\nThis is coming as the apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the southern states\u2019 legislatures have declared their support for the resolutions of the 17 southern governors on open grazing and restructuring.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that states that already have the anti-open grazing law in place are facing challenges of implementation due to lack of commitment of the Police to enforce the law.\n\nThe affected states include: Ekiti, Abia, Ebonyi, Oyo and Bayelsa.\n\nIn Ekiti State, the anti-grazing law was passed under the acronym : \u201cProhibition of Cattle and Other Ruminants Grazing Law 2016\u201d.\n\nBut the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, told THISDAY that the federal government\u2019s recalcitrant posture on the creation of State police was stalling the enforcement of the state\u2019s Anti-Open Grazing Law.\n\nAfuye said the law, passed in 2016 under the former Governor Ayodele Fayose, with the present Kayode Fayemi-led government strengthening the law further, could have been better implemented, but for unitary nature of the Nigerian Police.\n\nAfuye appealed to the National Assembly to accede to the request for the creation of State Police in the impending Constitutionl\n\nReview to be undertaken by the 9th National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe police seem to be firmly under the control of the federal even when the governors are the chief security officers. This is an aberration under a federation.\n\n\u201cBut if all the states have their own police that can be controlled by the governors, a law like this promulgated by states can be enforced easily.\n\n\u201cBut we have the Amotekun Corps that has been trying to checkmate some of these suspected herders destroying our farms and causing food scarcity.\u201d\n\nIn Abia State, the anti-open grazing law has been in existence for nearly three years.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Control of Nomadic Cattle Rearing and Prohibition of Grazing Routes/Reserves Bill 2016 was passed into law by the State House of Assembly in June 2018.\n\nThe law provides that the entry of trade cattle into the state shall be by rail or by road haulage.\n\nIt further stipulates that movement of trade cattle to major towns in the state shall be by truck, trailers/vehicles or pick-up vans.\n\nIt provides that defaulters, if convicted, shall be punished with a fine of N200,000 or six months imprisonment or both.\n\nHowever, the anti-open grazing law has been largely ignored by the police and other federal security agencies.\n\nGovernor Okezie Ikpeazu had publicly expressed his frustration with the security agencies\u2019 failure or even outright refusal to enforce the anti-open grazing law.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu told THISDAY that the attitude of federal- controlled security agencies to take orders only from federal authorities has further reinforced the clamour for the establishment of state police.\n\nIn Oyo State, the state House of Assembly in October 2019 passed a bill titled: \u2018Oyo State Open Rearing and Grazing Regulation Law\u2019, which has been signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde,.\n\nThe law states, among others, that anyone who engages in open rearing or grazing of livestock is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for five years or a fine of N500,000 or both.\n\nSubsequent offenders shall upon conviction be liable to 10-year imprisonment or a fine of N2 million or both.\n\nSpeaking on the challenges facing its implementation in the state, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, told THISDAY that the state has not been able to implement the law because the security agencies with the power to enforce it are under the control of the federal government.\n\nHe said the challenge was due to the fact that the country is not practising federalism.\n\n\u201cWhile the anti-open grazing law has become fully operational in the state, however there is no doubt that there is problem in its implementation with the state not in control of the security agencies who have the force of law to enforce it. Indeed, the implementation is been hampered by the slow response by the police to enforce the law,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso despite the enactment of the anti-open grazing law by the Bayelsa State Government to keep cattle within the Bayelsa Oil Palm Estate, Elebele near Yenagoa, farmers in the state have continued to complain that herdsmen still moved their cattle around and encroached on farmlands.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the police in the state were not committed to the enforcement of the law.\n\nBut the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Ayiba Fuba, told THISDAY that the state government would view seriously any case of herders of cattle in the state flouting the law.\n\nEbonyi State government had also enacted law on Anti-open grazing in 2018.\n\nBut since legislation: \u201cLaw No. 010 of 2018: Ebonyi State Miscellaneous Offences Law, 2018,\u201d was assented to by the Governor David Umahi, the law has become dormant due to non-implementation even with the constant clashes between herders and farmers in the state .\n\nA top official of the state government told THISDAY at the weekend that the state government has no means of enforcing the law in the state.\n\n\u201cThe anti-open grazing law has been passed. But you know that it is not part of the rules of engagement of the federal police or any other security agencies to enforce. So, it\u2019s hopeful that with the formation of Ebube Agu security outfit, they can begin to enforce the law in the state,\u201d he said\n\nEight Southern States Set to Enact Law\n\nDespite the challenges in the implementation of the law by the states that had enacted it, no fewer than eight states are now set to enact anti-open grazing law following the pronouncement of the 17 southern governors.\n\nIn Ondo State, the anti-open grazing law has passed through the public hearing stage at the Ondo State House of Assembly.\n\nThe Chairman, House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Gbenga Omole, told THISDAY at the weekend that the proposed law, was committed for public hearing after it had passed through the First and Second Reading.\n\nHe said the proposed law had been committed to committee level and would have been passed if not for the strike by Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN).\n\nThe lawmaker said the proposed law, when passed would replace the former Western State Forestry Law, that is no longer useful for the current situation concerning grazing.\n\nIn Enugu State, the state lawmakers said they were eagerly awaiting the Executive Bill expected to herald the anti-grazing law in the state.\n\nChairman of the House of Assembly Committee on Information, Hon. Jeff Mba told THISDAY that the 24 members of the assembly were ready to support any move to protect the lives and property of the people.\n\nHe explained that since it would be an executive bill, the legislators were eagerly expecting the executive arm of government to do the needful.\n\nIn Edo State, the state House of Assembly said it already had a private bill against open grazing, which was kept in abeyance because of its sensitive nature.\n\nThe lawmakers said they were waiting for Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s Executive Bill against open grazing to fine-tune it.\n\n\u201cThe private bill was Kept in View (KIV) because we want to conduct a public hearing\u201d, Edo State Speaker, Hon. Marcus Onobu, told THISDAY on Friday.\n\nOnobu however, added that with the outcome and resolution of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum in Asaba, Delta State, the assembly was more determined to work on the anti-open grazing bill by passing it into law as soon as possible.\n\nOsun State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode told THISDAY that the state had already put a law in place, which places duty on owners of livestock to take proper care of their livestock and keep them in check within perimeter fencing to prevent them from roaming and disturbing other people\u2019s properties or damaging crops .\n\nShe further disclosed that the state government is ready to review the law to accommodate other current realities if the need arises.\n\n\u201cAccording to Section 27(4) of the Law, any person who violates the provision of the law is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe disclosed that Osun State has always been supportive of stakeholders in agribusiness and farmers , whether those in crop farming or livestock farming know this.\n\n\u201cThe existing law discourages open-grazing. To further ensure peaceful co-existence in our agribusiness sector, the state also has a committee in place where herders and crop farmers relate and resolve issues before they spiral out of control. We have been able to manage the sector because Governor Oyetola is particularly interested in growing agriculture as a business.\u201d\n\nHowever the commissioner stressed that \u201cif there is a need to review the existing Livestock Roaming Law to accommodate new sections or current realities, you can be rest assured that our response will be swift. We are all about safety and security of citizens of Osun, livestock farmers, crop farmers, everybody counts in Osun\u201d\n\nAlso in his own submission the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon Timothy Owoeye who spoke through to THISDAY through the lawmakers\u2019 image maker, Hon. Kunle Alabi confirmed that the state has a law that prohibits open grazing of livestocks.\n\nThe Cross River State Government is also planning to enact the anti-open grazing law.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the state lawmakers had through a resolution urged the state government to reject open grazing by cattle and other animals because it was against an established environmental law of the state.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Hon. Eteng Jonah William, told THISDAY that \u201cthe resolution subsists and the lawmakers remain opposed to open grazing.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the resolution of the Southern governors\u2019 forum was just an affirmation of the position held by the lawmakers.\n\nThough the Cross River State Government was not represented at the Southern Governors\u2019 meeting in Asaba, Delta State, where open grazing was banned, the Special Adviser on Media and Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ben Ayade, Mr. Christian Nta, told THISDAY that the state was part of the decision, and would wait for modalities to be worked out before enacting any law.\n\nAyade had introduced the cultivation of special specie of grass known as \u201cKing Grass,\u201d to be exported to other parts of the country to feed livestocks.\n\nIn Anambra State, there is no law banning open grazing of cattle but a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, who spoke to THISDAY said the lawmakers were awaiting executive bill on the issue to curb the frequent clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nImo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Declan Emelumba referred THISDAY to the state house of Assembly, noting that it was the house of Assembly that has right to talk on the subject matter.\n\nA member of the House of Assembly told THISDAY that the lawmakers will initiate the bill as soon as the security challenges in the state are resolved.\n\nSouthern Speakers, Ohanaeze Back 17 govs\u2019 Resolutions\n\nMeanwhile, the apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the southern states\u2019 legislatures have declared their support for the resolutions of the 17 southern governors on open grazing and restructuring.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mr. Alex Ogbonnia told journalists in Enugu at the weekend that the move would go a long way in dealing with the prolonged clashes between herdsmen and farmers.\n\nHe regretted that the herdsmen have been allowed to carry guns over the years which has often given them the courage to always attack communities that do not allow them to destroy their farms.\n\n\u201cEverything they talked about during the meeting is in line with the position of Ohanaeze and we are very comfortable with it because open grazing has been the source of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nOn reactions by some northern elements over the ban, he said \u201cit is normal for people to protest against moves, whether good or bad. Change comes with a level of resistance. But we hope they will come to realize the importance of the ban and queue in because it is something that has to be done\u201d.\n\nOn their part, the speakers commended the Southern Governors \u201cfor coming together to speak with one voice\u201d, saying the resolutions of the Southern Governors were pathways to resolving the plethora of problems facing the country, including insecurity.\n\nThey said that the issues that prompted the resolutions reached by the governors in the recent meeting in Asaba were too well known to all Nigerians, that all that was required was for the federal government to take appropriate steps urgently to address the issues canvassed by the southern governors.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists, the lawmakers vowed to use their position to give the resolutions by the governors the needed legislative backing or support.\n\nThe Speakers in a statement made available to THISDAY in Asaba, said: \u201cWe the Speakers of State Legislatures in Southern Nigeria commend the Governors of the Southern States for their patriotism and firm belief in the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cWe adopt all the positions in the communique and reiterate the call for the ban on open grazing of cattle in the South.\n\n\u201cWe support the call for the restructuring of the country to enthrone true federalism and therefore the convocation of a National Dialogue is inevitable,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cWe also urge the Governors to send bills to the (respective) Legislature, where necessary, to address some of the issues in the communiqu\u00e9\u201d.\n\nThey hailed the Governor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, for providing the platform for the meeting of the governors.\n\nThe speakers\u2019 resolution was signed by Chief Sheriff F.O Oborevwori, Deputy National Chairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria; Mr Aniekan Bassey, Vice-Chairman South-South, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria; Francis O.Nwifuru, Vice-Chairman South East, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria; and, Prince Olakunle Taiwo Oluomo, Vice-Chairman South-West, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Averting Third Wave of COVID-19 Beyond Travel Advisory, NMA, Tomori Tell FG",
          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nAs Nigeria grapples with the challenge of a looming threat of third wave of COVID-19 hitting the country, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and a renowned professor of Virology and infectious disease control, Prof. Olawale Tomori, have cautioned the federal government not to allow complacency to stall measures being taken to check the outbreak of a third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, stressing that averting the scourge goes beyond just issuing travel advisory.\n\nThey noted that the most important steps would be the enforcement and implementation of the measures put in place.\n\nThey however commended the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 on the recently issued international travel advisory and the re-introduction of restrictions, all aimed at averting the third wave of the infection.\n\nNMA\u2019s President, Prof. Innocent Ujah told THISDAY at the weekend that the federal government should ensure adequate enforcement and monitoring of the measures it recently announced to check the importation of a more deadly variant of COVID-19 virus from other countries.\n\n\u201cI want to say that NMA is very happy and we commend federal government for taken proactive steps to respond to the threat of a third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, by issuing timely health advisory regarding those passengers coming from Turkey, India and Brazil.\n\n\u201cThis is a very commendable effort because this is what we had advocated for early in 2020 shortly before COVID-19 came in, that we should close our borders so that we don\u2019t have any importation of the virus, but unfortunately before they did that, it was late and therefore many of our people got infected. However, this time , the advisory note issued by the federal government is very important and NMA commends it,\u201d he said..\n\nThe NMA boss spoke on the aspect of the travel restrictions contained in the government\u2019s COVID-19 health advisory, describing it as good decision.\n\nHe, however pointed out that the authorities should not stop at that but should ensure that the recommended health protocols be strictly enforced to make the response effective.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is strict enforcement and monitoring so that anybody coming into the country must be made to go through a protocol and then be quarantined and if tested positive, kept in isolation centre.\n\n\u201cThis requires strict monitoring because science monitoring. When they monitor and discover that many people coming in, test positive then they can effect a travel ban to those countries.\n\nOn the suggestion that government should go further to impose outright travel ban on countries proven to be witnessing resurgent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Ujah said NMA would go for a systematic approach that would be based on correct analysis of the present situation.\n\n\u201cWe need to systematically follow the issue because COVID-19 has socio-economic consequences. So, I think we should be very careful and be able to enforce the health protocols \u2013 for instance, ensuring that people take precautionary measures such as putting on facemasks and observing social distancing\u201d.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of revamping the vaccine production factory in Nigeria, Ujah said it was a good plan.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with the setting up of the joint venture facility between May and Baker and Bio-vaccine, NMA believed the country was on verge of establishing the local vaccine manufacturing facility.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the federal government to do something to revamp the vaccine production company in Yaba, Lagos State so that Nigeria can be able to produce vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cNigerians are talented and hard-working and all they need is encouragement,\u201d Ujah said.\n\nWhile reacting to the delay in actualising the resuscitation of the vaccine factory, Ujah said that the problem may be due to lack of confidence by foreign partners and the security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cWe need to build confidence. Nigerian government should be able to provide a conducive environment; the security situation must improve because nobody wants to invest in a country where there is violence, kidnapping, maiming, Boko Haram, and armed robbery. These are some of the things that probably may be making other countries to be hesitant to come and partner with us . But you see, partnership and collaboration is what we need if we are to reestablish and reactivate vaccine production in Nigeria,\u201d he said .\n\nWhile supporting NMA\u2019s position, Tomori said the problem with the country\u2019s efforts to check the spread of COVID-19 virus were that of poor compliance and poor enforcement of the health advisory.\n\nTomori told THISDAY that whether the country would relapse into another wave of COVID-19 pandemic or not would depend on how the people cooperate with government to maintain non-pharmaceutical protocols.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe do not have the third wave yet. but it may come. Government has done the right thing by this selective targeting of activities likely to contribute to the spread of the disease. It is now in our hands to make sure we do not allow the virus to spread.\n\n\u201cThrough our carelessness and disregard of non-pharmaceutucal interventions, we got the second wave. If we continue, the third wave is sure to come\u201d.\n\nWhile assessing the measures rolled out by the federal government, Tomori said the steps were good but needed to be embraced by all the citizens for it to be more effective in checking the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFor now, the measures are okay. The need for additional measures depends on whether we, the citizens collaborate with government in adhering to the guidelines or not. We should get involved and play an active role by encouraging and ensuring the participation of every citizen.\n\n\u201cThe government has already suspended flights from some countries. I am sure the situation is being monitored by the government,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u202212 countries also beneficiaries\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has picked 26 foreign and local companies as well as 12 countries to lift the country\u2019s crude oil for the next two years.\n\nThe crude term contracts, expected to run from 2021 through 2023, would see the firms and the selected nations, which would operate on a Government-to-Government (G2G) basis to purchase the commodity from the national oil company.\n\nThe deal is coming less than a week after the corporation chose 16 oil and gas consortia for its new crude-for-fuel swap contracts for one year starting in August.\n\nThe contracts, known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP) are high-stakes agreements used to supply nearly all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol needs as well as cover some of its diesel and jet fuel consumption.\n\nHowever, in the fresh crude oil term agreements, it was observed that the names of majority of the companies involved in the DSDP deal also appeared in the list of those picked by the national oil company for the crude term contracts.\n\nThe list sighted by THISDAY showed that the preferred companies included Sahara Energy Resources Limited, Oando, Duke oil (an NNPC subsidiary), Petrogas, AA Rano, MRS, Mercuria and Vitol.\n\nOther oil and gas concerns which scaled the NNPC selection hurdle were Oceanbed Trading Limited, Levene Energy, Bono Energy , Mocoh Energy, BP Oil, West Africa Gas Limited, Litasco SA, Emadeb, Hyde, Matrix and Brittania-U.\n\nOther names listed by the NNPC as having qualified for the contracts included Masters, AMG, Casiva, Barbedos, Trafigura, Hindustan and Patermina.\n\nNNPC has its own equity share of crude oil from its Joint Ventures (JVs), usually shared on a 60 to 40 basis and thereafter appoints companies and issues licences to lift its share of the oil on a Free on Board (FOB) basis.\n\nThe companies and countries nominate ships that transport the crude which is sold in the international market. Sometimes, the NNPC also awards contracts to governments to carry out the business.\n\nIn the document approving the qualified countries, China, Niger, Cote D\u2019voire, Ghana, India, Togo, South Africa came tops, while Sierra Leone, Liberia, Turkey, Senegal, and Fujaira also made the cut.\n\nTypically, entities qualified to take part in the contract bid are divided into four categories, namely a bonafide end user who owns a refinery and or retail outlets that can process Nigerian crude oil grades.\n\nFor the government to government contracts, or what is termed \u201cbilateral relationships\u201d, with what the corporation terms \u201chigh energy consuming nations\u201d, bidding nations must provide proof that the entity is wholly owned by the relevant country or provide evidence of a bilateral agreement with the designated nation.\n\nThe third category is the internationally established and globally recognised large volume crude oil traders, while the fourth classification are indigenous companies engaged in Nigeria oil and gas downstream business activities.\n\nIn addition, qualifying foreign companies must demonstrate a minimum annual turnover of $500 million or the naira equivalent and a net worth of not less than $250 million or the naira equivalent for the previous financial year.\n\nFor indigenous firms, they are required to have a minimum turnover of $200 million or the naira equivalent and a net worth of $100 million for the preceding financial year ending.\n\nBidders are also to show their ability to handle supplies of crude and must list facilities and products processed or sold over the last three years, in addition to disclosing links to NNPC or the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPE) and confirming that directors have not been convicted of fraud or financial impropriety.\n\nAs with all Nigerian tenders, NNPC also highlights that the local content law must be strictly adhered to in terms of, among others, the use of Nigerian shipping companies, insurance and banks where possible.\n\nIn the past, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the country\u2019s oil and gas space had argued that G2G contracts with smaller, non-refining countries have high governance risks and low policy benefits for Nigeria.\n\nFor instance the Nigeria Natural Resource Charter (NNRC) has asked that term contracts should be carried out through a transparent and competitive tender process that includes robust pre-qualification standards and an end of sales to smaller non-refining countries unless NNPC can publicly explain the deals\u2019 policy benefits.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We are being chased out of Nasarawa State, and we are appealing to the governor not to allow the seemingly planned elimination of the Tiv community succeed under his watch.\u201d\n\nHowever, when contacted, the state Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Ramhan Nansel, said there was no report of such killings at the Giza Division of the state police command.\n\nIn a related development, four people were on Saturday killed when herdsmen attacked Yelwata community of Guma Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nAccording to a local source, those killed were teenagers who were working on their farm when the herdsmen stormed the area and killed them.\n\nFollowing the attack, angry youths in the area who recovered the corpses of the victims blocked the Makurdi-Lafia highway for several hours.\n\nEfforts by the military, the police and other security agencies to get the angry youths off the road were said to have been rebuffed causing heavy traffic gridlock on the major highway.\n\nAccording to the Chairman of Guma Local Government, Caleb Abah, three of the young men were killed on the farm while the fourth person died after one of the security personnel accidentally fired a shot at the angry crowd.\n\n\u201cSadly, in an attempt to disperse the angry youths who were resisting, there was a shot by the security agencies and unfortunately, one of the protesters was hit by a bullet and killed.\n\n\u201cAs we speak right now, calm has been restored to the area and we are already making arrangements for the dead to be buried,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe acknowledged the efforts of Governor Samuel Ortom who quickly mobilized some government functionaries to the troubled area to calm frayed nerves, which resulted in the quick resolution of the matter.\n\nHowever, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene could not be reached as at the time of filing this report as she did not pick or return calls.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Northern Governors, Listen to Ganduje, Masari",
          "text": "EDIFYING ELUCIDATIONS BY OKEY IKECHUKWU\n\nHe first made the call to his fellow northerners. But he was ignored. Then he tried, via Third Parties with media reach, to persuade herders to stop taking their cattle to the Middle Belt and the more southerly parts of the country for grazing. The conversation did not even begin. Then years rolled by. Today, more than four years since Governor Ganduje of Kano State began his campaign for sanity in livestock management in Nigeria, events are coming to a head. He had explained, back then, that his state had enough room and water resources to carter for the needs of all herders in Nigeria. He repeated this appeal some two years ago, detailing the availability of ideal natural resources for animal husbandry, and giving good reasons why this should be taken advantage of.\n\nStill, no one paid attention. Then, a few weeks back, he took great pains to draw national attention to three things, namely: (1) The steady, and frightening, flow of herders into our country, which he suggested should take up at the level of ECOWAS and stopped; (2) The fact that the presumed herders some northern governors are busy defending are also now more of gun smugglers and bandits than herdsmen and (3) The unwisdom of continued movement of cattle from the north southwards, especially because of its negative impact on the herds, the herders and farmers; in addition to the fact that it now posed a major threat to national security. But no one seems to have been paying attention to Ganduje\u2019s objective and patriotic submissions.\n\nThe resolute deafness of Ganduje\u2019s fellow governors from the north, who now routinely chorus a questionable defence of their cattle herding \u201cbrothers\u201d whenever the latter seem to have issues with host communities anywhere in the country, is baffling at best. These governors were quick to protest the sacking of herders from a government forest reserves in a South Western state, which the latter occupied in defiance of the law. It certainly did not occur to the northern governors, while they were defending the deviant herders, that they were thereby actually supporting criminality. It also did not occur to them that they are also simultaneously suggesting that Fulani herders are criminals. Are they? We all know that no law-abiding Fulani person, anywhere in the country, has been evicted, harassed, insulted in any way since all this drama began. Should this not make people think? To create the impression that herders, and especially Fulani herders, are by definition not law abiding is both unfair and unreasonable. It is really sad, no doubly tragic, that the very people elected to defend the people are engaged in a clearly unintended, stigmatization of Fulani herders as criminals in Nigeria today. Why, if not for the wretched politics of leaders who are perhaps reading their brief wrongly.\n\nNow that events are finally coming to a head, with the southern governors banning open grazing, the possibility of a quiet resolution is beginning to look distant. Would the southern governors have contemplated this, if the insensitivity of the Presidency and the impunity of Myetti Allah had sought limits in their triumphalism? Some have asked why the southern governors did not consult prominent Fulani people among them before taking their decision. They forgot to ask whether northern governors consulted anyone, including their own people, before they took their position against the EndSARS riots. Did they consult some prominent southerners among them when they introduced sharia law and Hisbah police? Most important of all, the northern governors have not stopped to ask themselves how many of the herders they are defending are actually Nigerians.\n\nYes, those who are screaming from the rooftop about decimation of the Fulani have forgotten to ask themselves whether it is not these same Fulani \u201cbrothers\u201d that are wiping out the north, either as bandits, herders or insurgents. This singular fact is the most compelling reason for us to stop fooling ourselves, across all geopolitical divides. Let us pause, think and then recalibrate our actions and choice of words. Why should herders come from all over West Africa, wreck whatever they meet in the north, as they match southwards, and still be defended by northern governors? Why? Homes, communities, livelihoods and values have been demolished all over northern Nigeria by the marauding bands. What, for instance, Bauchi State in particular got to celebrate for its governor\u2019s continued defence of rampaging herders? How has the north, or any Village Head in the north who has had his livestock rustled, gained anything?\n\nInitially, some could venture the view that herders were constrained to defend themselves against armed attacks by cattle rustlers. What now? Is that still the case? Ask those elected to lead their respective peoples and hold the place together for us to build one nation what they are really doing today. Impressive grandstanding, with little attention paid to the damage we are doing to national cohesion, is not leadership. It is alright to hold series of security meetings, all gearing towards getting the president to declare a state of emergency on national security. But this is not the solution many people think it is.\n\nGovernor Masari of Katsina State has already put paid to the folly of assuming that declaration of a state of emergency by the president will end insecurity, or insurgency; or remove the fact that our military and security personnel are already overstretched. Unprocured military hardware will not fall from the sky, just because the president made a speech, declaring a state of emergency. Endangered communities that have worked out a symbiotic relationship with the insurgents will not suddenly start cooperating with the military and security agencies because the president made a speech in Abuja. That is why the northern governors should listen to their Katsina State counterpart, who is speaking from a realistic perspective on this particular issue. Masari\u2019s point is very important here, because several members of the National Assembly have also started mouthing the state of emergency lingo, obviously under the mistaken impression that they are thereby making serious suggestions about how to tackle the burgeoning national security impasse. Let\u2019s get real!\n\nTruth be told, the current national crisis under a Buhari Presidency is not entirely surprising. At least not to some of us. In an article which appeared on this page two months before the 2015 elections that brought in Buhari as president, I narrated how a total stranger who was a supporter of the Buhari candidacy sought me out. In the course of a long discussion about Nigeria\u2019s future and the 2015 elections, he shot out without warning: \u201cPlease tell me, Dr Ikechukwu, if you don\u2019t mind, what is your personal opinion of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari\u2019? I replied that I considered him a serious-minded soldier who means well for the country. I added that I believe he had chosen the wrong path in his presidential aspiration. Then the man asked again: \u201cSo what would you advise him to do, if you were in a position to do so?\u201d I replied that I would ask him to work with other senior retired and respected officers, in an effort to save and re-professionalise our armed forces. Alternatively, that is if he must go into politics, he should \u201cbe part of a team of principled elders who would screen those seeking office in his chosen party, in order to play a custodian role in propagating certain leadership values.\n\nContinuing, I said: \u201c\u2026the position of some of us on Buhari is not shaped by current events. For instance when, in 1999, I wrote an article in The Guardian titled \u201cThe Mutant Called PTF\u201d, the objective was to remind Nigerians that the PTF should be wound up after the elections ushering in a democratic dispensation\u2026 to allow the regular institutions of state the free space to rise to their statutory responsibilities under the emerging democratic order.\u201d My position was that \u201cA Fund that was set up as a temporary bridge intervention \u2026 could not possibly be allowed to continue in its capacity at the time, under the newly elected President Obasanjo. \u2026Statutory agencies should regain their strength and be allowed to do their duties, to eliminate double budgeting and the antics of agencies that hide behind interventions initiatives to shirk some aspects of their statutory responsibilities \u2013 or even wreak havoc on the common till.\u201d\n\nAre we not going back today to variants of the sharing of \u201cessential commodities\u201d in the form of all manner of cash transfers, as the main business of government? Also, looking at appointments and distribution of national resources, as happened under the PTF, \u201c\u2026the figures and records of the performance\u201d show \u201c\u2026frightening cases of avoidable inequities, questionable administrative processes and, possibly, procedural irregularities\u2026.\u201d I said in 2015: \u201cThen as now, the suspicion is that Buhari does not seem to easily see the full picture when it comes to the workings of a modern polity, under a process-driven template. He never saw that outsourcing of statutory state functions and also doing parallel funding of government services undermined the accounting system and created a dysfunctional service delivery environment.\u201d\n\nI concluded the pre-2015 election article with these words: \u201cGen. Buhari would long since have made a lot of difference since he left active service if he had focused on helping develop his chosen profession. Today, chances are that his current sponsors only want to use him to secure new berths and expanses. The sings are emerging by the hour.\u201d Sadly true, I am inclined to think and say.\n\nThe real tragedy today is that no one seems to be taking inventory of what we are spending on, or where we are headed. What is the state of our hospitals and the health sector generally, after one year into the Covid-19 pandemic and after spending a few trillions of Naira? Where are we on food supply, after tonnes of cash on agric loans? Why has the poverty index not shown any positive signs after the trillions of Naira thrown at it for six years now? Is education faring any better, especially as insecurity is shutting down schools in an already disadvantaged northern Nigeria? This is the time to listen to reason \u2013 for all governors.\n\nQUOTE\n\nThat is why the northern governors should listen to their Katsina State counterpart, who is speaking from a realistic perspective on this particular issue.

The group also claimed four military vehicles were destroyed.\n\nIn February, about 20 soldiers were also killed in Malari, Borno State by the insurgents.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the soldiers were on patrol to clear some Boko Haram elements in the area following a credible intelligence when they were ambushed by the group.",

          "title": "The Evil Called \u2018Suicide\u2019, Causes And Practical Ways To Avoid It By Oluwafemi Adegbeyeni",
          "text": "As culled online, the Cambridge Dictionary defines suicide as \"the act of killing yourself intentionally\". Suicide is a social phenomenon, an instance of someone killing himself or herself or of multiple people doing it.\n\nIn Latin word, suicide is broken into 'sui'(yourself) and 'caedere'(to kill). It is an intentional self homicide of a person.\n\nForemost, taking a look at the spiritual perspective, God as the supreme being, created man and woman and gave them live.\n\nReligions have often condemn suicide, it is being analysed as a sin against the creator. For instance, the fifth commandment in the scripture in Exodus 20:13 shows that God is the Lord over life and death. He says \"you shall not murder/kill\"\n\nDespite the clear instruction from the creator, some men and women have taken their lives through suicidal acts, therefore, sinning against their creator.\n\nNigeria as a case study, has high rate of suicide. Suicide has taken place in many places in Nigeria and the victims of this suicide are majorly young ones.\n\nNigeria has tried to curb the act legally. Attempt to commit Suicide has been criminalised in section 327 of the criminal code Act. It states \"any person who attempts to kill himself is guilty of misdemeanor and is liable to imprisonment for one year\".\n\nHowever, there have been questions begging for answers as regards this. How effective has been section 327 of the code in preventing suicide in a country of high rate of illiteracy? Even the ones that are literate also commit suicide. Is the situation of the country so bad and has the leadership of the country made life difficult for people to commit suicide? Has counselling sector been effectively activated in Nigeria? What are some of the causes of suicide in Nigeria?\n\nThe last question shall be our focus and conclusion.\n\nStating the spiritual aspect first, it has been established above that God is the giver of life, and he takes it when it is time. In my opinion, only God has power to give life but he's not the only one who can take it.\n\nThere are powers and principalities in darkness who are in the business of pushing people to death, killing them and destroying destinies.\n\nSuicide is evil, it is one of the weapons of the devil.\n\nTo overcome this, one must \"GET GOD\" because only through God shall we overcome them.\n\nA student confessed to me some hours ago, that she had wanted to commit suicide in year one in the varsity but the holy spirit ministered to her and warned her against killing herself. It was pointed to her that she would lose here on earth and also lose eternity.\n\nOne must believe in God and his name. The scripture says \"the name of God is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and is saved\". One must be truly saved, be righteous and always run to God in all situations.\n\nFinancial crisis may also lead a person to commit suicide. A situation where a person falls into huge debt or penury, such person may be forced by the forces of life to end it.\n\nAnyone who finds himself/herself in this situation should cry out for help! Don't be silent about your predicament!!! Open up to as many as people and you will surely find someone to help you out. Visit governmental(non) organisations, churches and other helping bodies to help your situation.\n\nAnother rampant cause of suicide, among the young ones especially, is that of failed relationship. Relationship failure has made many young girls/ladies and even the boys to commit suicide over the years.\n\nNo boyfriend/girlfriend or fiance/fiancee, or husband/wife should make you kill yourself!!!\n\nYou are great and even greater than the person you want to kill yourself because of...If you lose your relationship, there are many people in the world, get another partner and move on!\n\nNever kill yourself because of anyone in life, because you are more precious. THE WORLD NEEDS YOU, GOD NEEDS YOU!!!\n\nAcademic problem is also another cause of suicide which happens in schools. Failure in an examination or of a course is not the end of life. Seek for counselling, mentoring and tutorship. Seek to get better academically. Meet people that are better than you!!!\n\nOther cause of suicide are; family problems, depression/boredom, personal or internal problems among others.\n\nIn all of these, don't not be silent, open up! Make friends, have a confidant, love companionship!! don't be silent!!!\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to submit that everyone should make it a responsibility to prevent suicide and stop it in totality. The Government should make active laws against suicide and also enforce such laws. Dangerous items used in commiting suicide should be made scarce, if possible, should be banned in the society. No need is more than human life!!!\n\nBoth spiritually and physically, everyone must be at alert to combat the evil called suicide! YES!! SUICIDE CAN BE STOPPED!!!",

          "text": "Airtel Africa, the holding company for Bharti Airtel\u2019s operations in Africa, has released its financial report for the year ended March 31, 2021. One of the report highlights is that the company\u2019s revenues are up by 14.2% to $3.8 billion.\n\nOn the back of this revenue, Airtel Africa also posted net profits of $415 million, a slight growth of 1.8% from the previous year where it made $408 million in profits after tax.\n\nDespite the flat profit growth, it is still an impressive result for the business in a year where Covid-19 has stalled economic growth across Africa. Additionally, in Nigeria, the company\u2019s biggest market, a ban on SIM card registration stifled growth.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s CEO, Raghunath Mandava, said in a statement, \u201cIn these challenging times, I want to say a huge thank you to all our employees, our business partners, and governments and regulators who have supported us, and in turn facilitated our continued support to the economies and communities we serve.\n\nOur performance has been strong, \u201cwith reported growth of 13.6% in underlying revenue and 18.3% in underlying EBITDA, and constant currency growth of 19.4% and 25.2%, respectively. Contributions to this growth came across all regions, with particular improvement in Francophone Africa, and across all our major services, with mobile money, data and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nA look at the company\u2019s significant services shows that voice revenue continues to lead the way, bringing in more than half its revenue. Yet, that does not tell the whole story, as the growth in voice revenue has slowed over the last few years.\n\nData and mobile money revenue are the real stars of the show. Data contributed 35% to the revenue as it continues to show promise as Airtel deepens its investment in internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cData usage per customer reached 2.6 GB per customer (from 1.8 GB per customer) led by an increase in smartphone penetration and expansion of our home broadband and enterprise customers. This helped us grow data revenue 31.2% in constant currency. Growing penetration and usage of 3G and 4G data customers helped us grow data ARPU 8.2%. 4G data usage more than doubled in the year, contributing 62.2% of total data usage on the network in Q4\u201921.\u201d\n\nAirtel Money is also seeing significant growth, adding $401 million to revenue compared to the $311 million it added last year. According to Airtel, \u201cWe have increased the number of mobile money agents by 30.7%, kiosks by 68.8% and mobile money branches by 95%. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, both through partnerships with leading financial institutions and through expansion of our merchant ecosystem, have further strengthened our mobile money propositions.\u201d\n\nAnother important update from the report is a leadership change at Airtel Africa as Mandava will retire from his post and as a director on 30 September. Olusegun Ogunsanya will take over as the new managing director and CEO.",

          "title": "A startup bill for Nigeria is being discussed between founders, investors and government reps",
          "text": "One landmark acquisition, several funding rounds and meaningful expansions have drawn attention to Nigeria\u2019s potential to become an enabling environment for businesses. Nigerian tech startups are raising larger seed rounds and pursuing unique global ambitions than at any other time in the last decade.\n\nBut in the last 18 months, major regulatory events that ended motorcycle-hailing and suspended cryptocurrency transactions through banks have been interpreted as setbacks to innovation.\n\nOne problem with these types of regulations is how sudden they are, seemingly without forewarning from the hammer bearers. They raise an unambiguous question: can startups really flourish in Nigeria?\n\nTo dispel such fears and sustain optimism about doing business in Nigeria, startup leaders are fishing for solutions with the cooperation of government officials. One urgent offer on the table is a Nigeria startup bill.\n\nMaking laws work\n\nLast weekend, Kola Aina*, founding partner of Ventures Platform, talked about a plan to \u201cco-create an executive bill that will support the growth of our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe event was a virtual ecosystem townhall with the theme Making laws work for startups in Nigeria.\n\nAina was joined by Adaeze Sokan, Ventures Platform\u2019s director of strategy and policy; Iyin Aboyeji*, general partner of Future Africa; and Adia Sowho, acting CEO of Thrive Agric.\n\nAlso on the call were Oswald Guobadia, senior special assistant to the Nigerian president on digital transformation; Ife Adebayo, special assistant to the vice president on innovation and entrepreneurship; and Jon Stever, managing director of Innovation for Policy Foundation (i4Policy), a consultancy.\n\n\u201cMany of us have tried to do business with certain countries and institutions, and many of them often cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason they can\u2019t interact with us,\u201d Sowho said, explaining the need for a startup act.\n\nApart from disruptive regulation, she listed weak infrastructure and difficulty accessing capital among the problems facing Nigerian startups.\n\nA startup act could be a first step in setting up a structure around these problems. Tunisia (in 2018) and Senegal (in 2019) passed startup laws under similar rationales. Startup acts are becoming recognised as a tool for policy innovation in Africa.\n\nGlobal standard, local context\n\nSo what should a Nigerian startup act look like? Firstly, it must reflect the country\u2019s present reality.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is overborrow from the context of other countries,\u201d Sowho said.\n\n\u201cWe need the minutiae of this bill to be from our experience and understanding of this country of ours that is just very difficult to compare to other places.\u201d\n\nThat said, Nigerian startups operate within a global business environment. For one, the majority of venture capital investment in the sector comes from foreign inflows. This binds startups to international standards on operations, ethics and ambition.\n\nAt the very least, Nigerian startups should have enabling business conditions similar to those being designed in Senegal and Tunisia, but also in Ghana (which passed Africa\u2019s first small business act in 1981), South Africa, Kenya\u2026 and with some effort, the United States.\n\nJon Iver of i4Policy making a presentation about small business and startup Acts in Africa\n\ni4Policy helped co-create Senegal\u2019s startup act two years ago. At the townhall, Stever showed a timeline of small business and startup acts in Africa; Nigeria was not present.\n\nHe observed that startup acts are not made through regular lawmaking processes but typically result from entrepreneurs taking the initiative themselves.\n\nBut something else is noteworthy: \u201cIn the cases where this has been really successful, there has always been a government champion that wants to listen to startups,\u201d Stever said.\n\nIt would then seem a good omen for Nigeria\u2019s startup bill plans that this townhall had two government advisors, who work at the intersection of digitization and entrepreneurship, in attendance.\n\nGuobadia called attention to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s new year address, about a need for \u201can enabling environment to turn [young people\u2019s] passions into ideas that can be supported, groomed and scaled.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s agencies have made some moves in this regard.\n\nIn 2018, the Office of ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIIE) was involved in tech policy hackathons in Lagos and Abuja to develop frameworks for entrepreneurship and innovation. One goal of the Ministry of Digital Economy\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2030 strategy document is \u201c[supporting] digital entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions for local and global challenges.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment announced that a draft National Policy on Startups was on the government\u2019s agenda. Otunba Niyi Adebayo, the minister, has made a point of attending startup-related events, whether about attracting investment or engaging startups on what they are building.\n\nCurrently in a virtual meeting with The Bulb Africa Partnership who are presenting a mobile money and peer-to-peer payment/market place and showing interest in setting up a tech hub/campus to support tech startups and train youth who are interested in pic.twitter.com/yqaxf9ReGY \u2014 Otunba Niyi Adebayo (@NiyiAdebayo_) January 7, 2021\n\nIs this another false start?\n\nIt is great to have ecosystem players take the startup bill bull by the horns. But there were reminders \u2013 from Mark Essien, Hotels.ng CEO, and Lexi Novitske, a venture capitalist \u2013 that we have sort of been here before.\n\nGuobadia agreed, but said the presidency has spent time assessing what it would take to do better this time. They have identified a process problem, which will be solved by a \u201cbig tent\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cWe are building a fabric to knit all [relevant] agencies into this initiative. We took the effort to avoid having competing conversations,\u201d Guobadia said.\n\nAina\u2019s presentation indicated that the Nigerian presidency intends to introduce a draft legislation as early as August. It will be based on a draft startup law by ecosystem leaders with input from federal and state stakeholders from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nThe plan for a Nigeria startup bill\n\nTimelines could shift but parties involved in this bill have been in conversations for about two months, Aina said.\n\n\u201cI am very aware that there is already an ongoing consultation with the Lagos state government,\u201d he said, mentioning that a presidential advisory group on the proposed bill has been having meetings.\n\nKola Aina is one of the members of the Nigeria startup ecosystem leading the startup bill efforts\n\nAboyeji said the plans are still evolving at the moment but he is optimistic that this time could be different.\n\n\u201cI think versus other times, we have grown to such a size and scale that is easy to see what the potential benefits of fixing this issue could be.\u201d\n\nHe and Sowho emphasised that a Nigerian startup bill that works will not be achieved without startups participating in the process. \u201cThis will require sweat from all of us and we should be ready to put the work in,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nThe group has set the ball rolling and welcomes interested people to volunteer for the effort by sending an email to partners@venturesplatform.com, or provide feedback through this form.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: TechCabal hosted this event and has a representative on the Advisory Board for the startup bill project. *Through their firms, Kola Aina and Iyin Aboyeji are investors in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "text": "Source: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nIn April, TECNO launched the Spark 7 series, a new addition to the brand\u2019s Spark line-up, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIn TECNO\u2019s usual way, the Spark 7 comes with a lot of impressive upgrades when compared to its predecessors under the flagship. For the purpose of this article, we will be focusing on the more popular of the series, the Spark 7P.\n\nOut of the box, the Spark 7P comes in four colour variations \u2013 the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations \u2013 which allows for vivaciously interesting choices to pick from when in the market to buy the Spark 7P device.\n\nSCREEN FOR MAXIMUM VIEW\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nThe Spark 7P\u2019s screen is impressively massive and elegant. The device comes with a bigger and better 6.8-inch edge-to-edge display and a screen resolution of 720*1600 HD, bringing to your fingertips an immersive cinematic experience. Without a doubt, movie lovers, gamers and even vloggers will enjoy unfettered fun in whatever form they choose.\n\nTOP-NOTCH PICTURE QUALITY\n\nSpark 7P\u2019s 8MP selfie camera appears in a notch at the top of the device, with 2 LED flash positioned on both sides of the camera. At the back is the 16MP dual camera, with a depth sensor second module that makes the device\u2019s Video Bokeh feature possible. The camera can record 240fps slow-motion videos. Users can also enjoy close-up photography with a 4cm macro photography mode that allows to capture small and minute details. Additionally, the device includes AI HDR technology to increase dynamic range beyond what is captured by the camera\u2019s sensors, allowing users to take photos with a higher dynamic range, fewer noise and clearer details.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nSummarily, with the Spark 7P\u2019s newly upgraded algorithm AI Camera 3.0 and AI scene detection, photos taken by the device will be much more impressive and attractive under any scenario.\n\nPRIVACY FOR A HIGH PERFORMING MACHINE\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nOne special feature that comes with the Spark 7P is the Peak proof which lets you leave a portion of your screen dark so you can keep personal information out of the glare of people when you use your phone in public places.\n\nThe Spark 7P also packs a punch with a powerful 5,000 mAh battery, so that consumers can run powerful applications and multiple tabs without the need to constantly recharge. The high-performance device that runs on HIOS 7.5 allows for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting the mobile device. The operating system is also bundled with utility applications that allow users to free up memory, freeze applications and limit data accessibility to applications. With the device\u2019s dark mode, the phone also gives users more battery time and decreased blue light emission, reducing eye strain.\n\nAnother highlight of the Spark 7P is its 90Hz refreshing speed. With the blazing-fast 90Hz refresh rate, the animation on the device doesn\u2019t have to look like a flip book, but one smooth, snappy, and refreshing experience.\n\nIn terms of storage capacity, the Spark 7P is available in sizeable 4GB ROM+ 64GB RAM and 4GB+128GB versions and is available at a sweet price range of 60,900 Naira and 68,800 Naira respectively.\n\nTECNO\u2019s Spark series targets trendy students, but has quickly risen to become popular among young working professionals and middle-aged folks. If you are expecting my verdict on the Spark 7, considering its sleek look and feel, camera, battery, high performance and price, I will rate it an 8/10.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick. And quite honestly, I still don\u2019t know which to go for between the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations.\n\nNeed I say more? Spark 7P checks all my boxes! You know how they say a one-stop-shop for all your needs? Spark 7P is that for me. And the best part in all of this is the price the device is sold for. Ladies and gentlemen, the Spark 7P in all its glory sells at the sweet price range of 68,000 Naira only!\n\nI honestly can\u2019t wait to find my way to the nearest TECNO authorised store!\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick. And quite honestly, I still don\u2019t know which to go for between the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations.\n\nNeed I say more? Spark 7P checks all my boxes! You know how they say a one-stop-shop for all your needs? Spark 7P is that for me. And the best part in all of this is the price the device is sold for. Ladies and gentlemen, the Spark 7P in all its glory sells at the sweet price range of 68,000 Naira only!\n\nI honestly can\u2019t wait to find my way to the nearest TECNO authorised store!\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "On Saturday, May 8, 2021, the first dedicated Nigerian blockchain hub, Convexity Blockchain Hub (CBHUB), was inaugurated in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Stakeholders in the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN).\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the hub, Adedeji Owonibi, CBHUB Founder, says the aim is to create a hub ecosystem where people can come and just focus in a space dedicated to blockchain technology, a space to innovate and create solutions within Nigeria using blockchain.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, the hub will offer blockchain solutions that have absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian blockchain technology ecosystem is an arena relatively unknown to a lot of Nigerians. It is often confused with its more well-known subset, cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are popular uses of blockchain, it can also be used for other things, such as the solutions CBHUB would provide.\n\nThese solutions range from its Convexity Humanitarian Aid Distribution Solution (Chats), which is geared towards creating transparency in the aid distribution space to BitCert, one of its projects aimed at reducing certificate counterfeiting in schools.\n\nAs at launch time, CBHUB has partners in Lagos and also supports communities in Northern Nigeria, teaching classes in the local Hausa language.\n\nThis is a far cry from 2018 when Paxful, a leading Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency exchange, reported that it would be launching a blockchain incubator hub. This hub was to be headed by Chimezie Chuta, the Founder of Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG).\n\nHowever, Chuta says that after reviewing the information provided, the company wasn\u2019t convinced of the initiative\u2019s viability as a self-sustaining business. Ultimately, Paxful decided to pull the plug.\n\nFirst cryptocurrency forensics lab in Africa\n\nThe first African crypto forensics lab was also launched at the event on Saturday. The lab boasts world-class facilities and is the result of a partnership with Chainalysis, a global leader in the cryptocurrency forensics sphere.\n\nA Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime Report cites South Africa-based company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), as the biggest crypto investment scam of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, illicit cryptocurrency trading accounted for just 2% of Africa\u2019s $16 billion trading volume from July 2019 to June 2020, with scams accounting for 55% of this low level of illicit activity.\n\nWhile Africa has the lowest numbers for illicit cryptocurrency trading globally, the launch of CBHUB\u2019s crypto forensics lab is yet another plus in the fight against crypto scams like MTI.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, there are ways to attach identities to blockchain users despite the relative anonymity/pseudonymity of the technology.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) can be aggregated from crypto exchanges, laptops, and phones through which people interact with the blockchain technology.\n\nThe hub will provide essential tools for crypto-crime investigators and security agencies constantly faced with numerous challenges while investigating crypto-based crimes and illicit money transaction activities.\n\nAll that the investigators need is to reskill and upskill on how to use these tools, says Chuta.\n\nConvexity, truly the first?\n\nWhile CBHUB is undoubtedly Nigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub, it is not the first blockchain hub to be established in the country. In 2015, Blockchain Tech Hub was founded by Samuel Benedict Ogbonnaya.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn profile, it \u201cwas established with the aim of pioneering Blockchain innovation in Africa by training and producing the best qualified Blockchain developers in Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Tech Hub is no longer in operation; the link to its advertised website returns a \u201cThis site can\u2019t be reached\u201d page. Attempts to reach Ogbonnaya were futile as his LinkedIn and Twitter accounts last recorded activity in 2019.\n\nNigeria and blockchain\n\nIn October 2020, NITDA announced that it had started developing a blueprint and strategy document for the \u201cNational Adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIt followed this announcement with the release of the Draft National Blockchain Adoption Strategy. The document outlines the roadmap and strategies for adopting blockchain technology by the government in its digital transformation agenda.\n\nIt also highlights the strategic objectives and initiatives that the government will actively pursue through designated Ministries, Departments, & Agencies (MDAs) during the stipulated period.\n\nWhile the Federal Government of Nigeria has so far been silent on its steps going forward, the launch of the CBHUB portends a step in the right direction in Nigeria\u2019s blockchain adoption journey, especially regarding education and skilling up.\n\nThis, of course, must be reviewed in the light of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest crypto order which threw Nigerian crypto traders into a panic in February 2021.\n\nCBN ordered banks to close the accounts of persons or entities transacting cryptocurrency or operating a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt this stage, with its seemingly conflicting policies, two questions come to mind: Should Nigerian blockchain enthusiasts be cautiously optimistic? Would the Nigerian government take any more positive steps regarding blockchain soon?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions in the coming days should reveal more on this.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

It is what is being used in Government House. We are trying to create an electricity commission with laws that will allow them to sell to people outside of the state government facilities.\n\n\u201cThe Secretariat building and Government House are being powered by Ossiomo. It is on and working. We have a project to put about 70km of street lights around Benin City. The contractors are working on that. It is going to be powered by Ossiomo Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to change the laws to enable a distribution company to move the power from Ossiomo to your own homes; that is what we are working on now. Before long, the law should be passed, with the necessary regulatory permits obtained so that we can get power to individuals. Be rest assured that the turbines are there and are firing,\u201d the governor added.\n\nOn the dualisation of the Ekehuan Road project, the Obaseki noted, \u201cwe are not owing the contractors; we have enough money to complete the project. Major work has been done. It is just left for surfacing; the paving has been done. I won\u2019t be surprised if they come to site to finish up on time.\n\n\u201cThe rains particularly in April were quite treacherous and may have slowed down the pace of work for them. I want to assure you that funding is not a problem for the project. We have raised the bond early this year and part of the fund is for the project.\n\nThe money is there in the bank to fund the contractor.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "At least 1,603 people were killed in violent attacks across Nigeria between January and March 2021, a report by a non-governmental organisation, Nigeria Mourns, has shown.\n\nThe report titled \u201cViolent Incidents Report: January \u2013 March 2021\u2033 was published on Sunday.\n\nThe group said it gathered its figures through the use of newspaper reports and family sources to track violent killings.\n\nThe report also showed that 1,774 people were abducted within the three months under review.\n\n\u201cIn the Q1 of 2021, Nigeria continued to experience inordinately high incidents of armed violence with very high body counts. Our tracking shows that at least 1603 persons lost their lives in the country from January \u2013 March 2021,\u201d the group said on Twitter.\n\nOn the aspect of the perpetrators of the violence, the report revealed that 921 people were killed by suspected bandits, 207 people killed by persons suspected to be members of Boko Haram or its breakaway faction, ISWAP, 205 killed in isolated attacks and 106 lives were claimed by cult clashes.\n\nAlso, 79 people died through extra-judicial killings, communal crises led to the death of 53 people and 32 people killed by herdsmen.\n\nA member of the Nigeria Mourns Coalition, Ier Jonathan, said the figures are worrying \u201cbut not meant to criticise the government.\u201d\n\nRising insecurity\n\nNigeria has been battling with various forms of insecurity for years. This led to agitation by many citizens for state police.\n\nAs part of efforts to curb the challenges, South-west governors last year created a regional paramilitary outfit, Amotekun.\n\nAlso, the governors of the South-east states resolved to maintain a joint security outfit to be called Ebube Agu in April.\n\nAside from ordinary citizens, different state governors \u2013 Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Babagana Zulum of Borno, and Hope Uzodinma of Imo, among others, have been victims of violence as they or their properties were attacked.\n\nMr Ortom recently knocked the federal government for being complacent in the face of insecurity.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Bello of Niger State in early May told journalists that Boko Haram terrorists have been occupying some communities in the state.\n\nHe claimed the terrorists have displaced over 3,000 residents of the affected communities.\n\nGovernors want Buhari to address nation\n\nThe 17 governors in southern states of Nigeria, on Tuesday, asked the federal government to \u201cconvoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nThey called on President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201caddress Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe resolution was among 12 reached by the governors at their meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital.\n\nThe National Assembly had also called for a national security summit with the House of Representatives already announcing modalities for one of such.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has never shown support for such calls. He also did not endorse the establishment of state police.\n\nBuhari\u2019s aide blames \u2018evil forces\u2019\n\nAmidst the security challenges, President Buhari\u2019s media aide, Femi Adesina, blamed \u2018evil forces\u2019 popularly referred to as \u2018Aiye\u2019 in Yoruba as the reason for insecurity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201c\u2026Just as some forces knew the record that was to be achieved by Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerian President, and which he had begun to show since 2015 when he got into office, they positioned themselves against the government\n\n\u201cThe lesson? When you are high-flying, the centrifugal forces will come against you, and it would only take the grace of God for you to attain.\n\n\u201cYoruba people call those forces Aiye. When Aiye is on your case, as it was against Man City, and it is against the Buhari government, you need God, and God alone. Aiye (meaning \u2018the world,\u2019 if freely translated) is the negative part of mankind. The pernicious, baleful, sly and scheming part of humanity. If Aiye gets on your matter, you need God and God alone,\u201d his article published on Thursday partly read.\n\nHe, however, expressed optimism that Mr Buhari will conquer.\n\n\u201cWho says Nigeria will not rise from its current travails? Who says Aiye will always win? Not where God is involved. And God is involved with Nigeria, our own dear na Under President Buhari, peace and security would be restored. The economy would rebound. Life would be abundant for the people, and Aiye would be left standing small, holding the rump of the flag of a country it thought had gone into oblivion,\u201d he wrote.",

          "title": "Nigeria is indivisible, forget your tribe, come up with solutions to challenges \u2013 Atiku",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has called on all Nigerians, especially state governors, to pay less attention to their regional and tribal interests, but instead strive to come up with solutions to the country\u2019s collective challenges.\n\nAtiku who made the appeal in a statement on Sunday, in reaction to a meeting of Southern governors in Asaba, Delta State on Tuesday, wherein they banned open grazing in the region and asked for restructuring, argued that the country\u2019s problems cannot be solved by leaders thinking in terms of their regions, but in terms of Nigeria.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cNigeria Is Drifting: We Must Stop Waiting For Godot,\u201d the former vice president noted that Nigeria was drifting apart, but pointed out that the cause of the drift is a leadership that thinks in terms of region, and according to him, the solution cannot come by promoting the same mindset.\n\n\u201cThe major challenge facing Nigeria today is that we are drifting. We are not just drifting politically and economically. We are also drifting apart from each other.\n\n\u201cI have often said that the difference between us is not North and South, but between good and bad. Therefore, those who are good should come together to show those who are bad that we are in the overwhelming majority,\u201d Atiku said.\n\n\u201cI have repeatedly said that I am a Nigerian. Full stop. That is my identity. And now more than ever, we must ask ourselves this question: what does it mean to be a Nigerian?\n\n\u201cA Nigerian is one who is committed to the idea of the indivisibility of Nigeria and who is invested in respecting, even if you disagree with, the differences that exist within this nation space, and respecting the right of others to coexist with you irrespective of religious, regional or ethnic differences.\n\n\u201cThat is what being a Nigerian means to me. And that is why I believe that all those who believe in Nigeria should stand up to be counted.\n\n\u201cIt is unNigerian to terrorise your fellow citizens. Up until about a decade ago, we did not have this. It is unNigerian to abduct people. And this is undoubtedly a new menace that has low historical precedence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that if at a National level, we address these unNigerian tendencies immediately and dispassionately, we would not have Nigerians congregating at a regional or sub-regional level to address these issues.\n\n\u201cWhat our present challenges therefore call for is not fragmentation but concentration. We must concentrate and focus our national willpower and resolve towards fighting these unNigerian tendencies.\n\n\u201cGovernors representing some states have met. And I completely understand the necessity of their meeting and the wisdom of their decisions. But no matter how much you try to clap with one hand, the vibrations will not be the same as when you clap with two hands.\n\n\u201cWe have a national challenge. And as Albert Einstein said, \u201cWe cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese problems were created by those with a regional mindset, and will not be solved by those with a similar mindset.\u201d\n\nAtiku who was the presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, emphasized that the solution to the country\u2019s problem does not lie in Aso Rock, but in governors coming together to iron out the thorny issues affecting the destiny of the nation until they figure out a way to resolve them.\n\n\u201cFor too long, we have erroneously thought that the power to make effective changes lies at Aso Rock. But without the states, nobody can get to Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cThat is why for anyone to emerge as President of Nigeria, he or she must secure enough votes in two-thirds of the states that make up the Nigerian federation,\u201d Atiku continued.\n\n\u201cLet us apply this wisdom to our present challenges. I call on Nigerian Governors to stop waiting on Abuja to make changes, and instead convene a National Unity Summit of all Nigerian Governors to iron out the thorny issues affecting the destiny of our nation until they figure out a way to resolve them.\n\n\u201cForget about your party. Forget about your tribe. Respect your religion and allow it to bring out the better part of you. Meet together. Talk together. Come up with the solutions to all our collective challenges. And then go back to your states, and consult with your federal and state legislators, with a view to getting them to work with their colleagues to implement the solutions you came up with.\n\n\u201cThat is how to save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo keep waiting for this Federal Government to take the lead, and effect the changes that Nigeria needs to stop drifting, is to keep waiting for Godot. And that is a luxury we cannot afford.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford it because, according to the Global Terror Index, our beloved nation is now the third most terrorised nation on Earth.\n\n\u201cWe are featuring prominently on the Failed States Index, and the symbols of our nation, our currency, our passport, and our international standing are fast losing value.\n\n\u201cTo quote Einstein again, \u201cThose who have the privilege to know have the duty to act.\u201d We do know that our Governors know that all is not well with Nigeria. That is why they have been meeting. At regional and sub regional levels.\n\n\u201cThat knowledge comes with a duty to act, and to act together. Because if we do not act together, then the alternative is that we fall asunder. And God forbid that should ever be our fate.\n\n\u201cWe must be mindful of the fact that one in four Africans is a Nigerian. And one in seven Black people on Earth is Nigerian. Therefore, being so centrally placed by God, it ought to be clear to us that it is our duty to be a beacon of light to the Black World.\n\n\u201cIf we succeed as a nation, our successes will resonate beyond our borders. It will give hope to the Black Diaspora and increase the standing of Black people all over the world.\n\n\u201cThat is why we cannot fail. That is why we cannot retreat into our regional enclaves. Too much is at stake. We are too centrally located to be dislocated.\n\n\u201cTogether we must win forever. We are far too interconnected to be disconnected. Where would my children, who have a parent from each leg of Nigeria go? Where would your children, who have sunk roots far from their ancestral heritage, go?\n\n\u201cOliver Wendell Holmes once said that \u201cMan\u2019s mind, stretched to a new idea, never goes back to its original dimension.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me paraphrase him and say, Nigerian unity, stretched to a new frontier, should never go back to its original dimension.\n\n\u201cWe must grow in unity. We must glow in community. We must blow away disunity. We have no choice, considering the alternative, which is a calamity that we would not wish to return to.\n\n\u201cSo help us God.\n\n\u201cMay God bless Nigeria as one peaceful, progressive, and indivisible nation.\u201d",

          "text": "The governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, as well as other Southern governors, have maintained their stance on open grazing ban, noting that their decision is final.\n\nThe 17 Southern governors had after their meeting in Asaba, Delta State on Tuesday, issued a communique banning open grazing in the region, even as they asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately convene a national dialogue with a view of restructuring the country.\n\nHowever, their resolution attracted backlash from certain individuals in the North, notably Borno South Senator, Ali Ndume and Professor Usman Yusuf, former Executive Secretary of National Health Insurance Scheme, who argued that the ban could not stand, as the herders were not consulted.\n\nBut reaffirming his government\u2019s stand at the weekend, Ikpeazu reiterated his commitment to enforcing the ban on open grazing of cattle in Abia.\n\nThe governor who spoke during a zoom meeting with newsmen of Abia extraction under the aegis of Abia Media Forum, said that a bill was already in place to enforce the ban and to check the activities of criminal elements disguising as nomads.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the point of making sure that we enforce and implement it and even in doing that I must also share what I see as a challenge to the enforcement of that law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe law is in place and we are taking steps to enforce it. It has become imperative that we enforce that law strictly because we just noticed that we have big time trouble in our hands.\n\n\u201cWe have those that we refer to as criminal herdsmen; they are different from the ordinary herdsmen that we have been living with all these years. We now have in our mist bandits that have infiltrated from the rest of West Africa and other parts of Africa and their assignment is to come here rape, kill and kidnap people for money.\n\n\u201cIt is now very imperative that we enforce that law,\u2019\u2019 he added\n\nSimilarly, Rivers State governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, on Saturday, maintained that the ban will stay, as according to him, Southerners are not second class citizens of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at a civic reception organised in his honour by the Ogoni Ethnic Nationality of Rivers State in Bori, headquarters of Khana Local Government Area on Saturday, the state governor, Wike said the decision ban open grazing was cast in stone, even as he said he is not afraid of anybody.\n\n\u201cLook, I have been in government, I am in opposition, nobody can cow me. Magnus (Abe), they know, their government cannot cow me. I will say what I will say and I will do what is right for my people. Nobody will anything to me. I will die the day God says it is my day. Nobody can take my life when it is not time for me to die. So, let nobody be afraid,\u201d Wike said.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to say, all those who are saying why should Southern Governors ban grazing \u2013 I have taken further steps to fulfill what the Southern Governors said in Asaba. If anybody wants to die, go and die and hang yourself on electric pole.\n\n\u201cWe have taken a position and we are not going back. Enough is enough; we are not second class of citizens of this country. We also own this country and we must partake in what is happening in this country.\u201d\n\nAlso, Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, while addressing party members in Asaba at the weekend, maintained that the ban was sacrosanct, even as he said their call for devolution of powers was most in order.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard a lot about the southern governors meeting. We thank God for that meeting. We thank God for bringing us together. The things that we said aren\u2019t new. We\u2019re only re-echoing what our people have been agitating for,\u201d Okowa said.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately I read that somebody said we ought not to talk about certain things as elected people. If the voice of your people is out always and as an elected person you shy away from giving further voice to their voices, then you ought not to be in the position you occupy.\n\n\u201cSo, I thank our people in the House of Reps who have responded to the speech made by their colleagues,\u201d he enthused.\n\nOkowa argued that there was no reason for any region or individual to be afraid of the governors\u2019 stance as a non-issue relating to dismembering the country was discussed at the forum.\n\n\u201cAs I did say, there\u2019s none of the things we\u2019ve discussed that\u2019s against the unity of this country. We believe in the unity of our country as elected leaders. But we also went ahead to advance for some things that must be done to give strength to the unity.\n\n\u201cWe talked about restructuring which has been on the table for too long. Both the voices of the PDP and the APC have been on restructuring.\n\n\u201cAnd restructuring is all-inclusive and all-encompassing. We all have different views on it. But when we all sit at a round table, we\u2019ll agree on what\u2019s best for us all.\n\n\u201cThe conversations have started and our people are talking and when we do not give backing to their voices, then we\u2019re giving room for further crisis.\n\n\u201cOther leaders should thank the southern governors for giving further voices to the conversation which can bring about a country with fairness, equity and trust among the people,\u201d he concluded.",
          "summary": "The governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, as well as other Southern governors, have maintained their stance on open grazing ban, noting that their decision is final.\nBut reaffirming his government\u2019s stand at the weekend, Ikpeazu reiterated his commitment to enforcing the ban on open grazing of cattle in Abia.\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to say, all those who are saying why should Southern Governors ban grazing \u2013 I have taken further steps to fulfill what the Southern Governors said in Asaba.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard a lot about the southern governors meeting.\n\u201cOther leaders should thank the southern governors for giving further voices to the conversation which can bring about a country with fairness, equity and trust among the people,\u201d he concluded.",

That a state institution can issue such is a measure of the administration\u2019s commitment to accountability, equality and justice.\n\n\u201cTo set the records straight, the person declared wanted by the ICPC is not an in-law to President Buhari. While at some point in time, the said fugitive from justice had been linked to a family member in marriage; that relationship has ended some years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unfortunate to bring the Presidents family into this case. It is in our view an attempt to generate views and sell copies of sensational reporting.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s position at all times is that the law be allowed to take its course. As is well known of him, President Muhammadu Buhari will not provide any cover for crime, no matter who is involved.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC had said Kumo is wanted alongside Tarry Rufus and Bola Ogunsola over alleged misappropriation and dispersion of national housing fund.\n\nThe notice, published on the commission\u2019s website was signed by the ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Azuka Ogugua.\n\nIt reads, \u201cThe persons whose pictures appear above, Mr Tarry Rufus, Mr Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of $65m.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters, Abuja, any of the ICPC state offices or the nearest police station.\u201d\n\nKumo\u2019s tenure at FMBN was characterised by allegations of corruption.\n\nIt was alleged that the fleeing former boss of FMBN and three others paid themselves outrageous severance packages at the end of their tenure in October 2014.\n\nLast month, the senate committee on public accounts summoned Kumo to explain the alleged irregular award of N3 billion contract when he was still at the bank.",

          "text": "BY OUR CORRESPONDENT\n\nThe National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC) has said that it was set to introduce a central monitoring system that would ensure all earnings due to government on lottery are collected with precision.\n\nThe director-general of the commission, Mr. Lanre Gbajabiamila, said with the arrangements being put in place by the commission, lottery would soon be contributing significantly to the federal treasury as it\u2019s obtainable in advanced countries like America, UK and Spain.\n\nGbajabiamila in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja, by the assistant director, Public Affairs, Magnus Ekechukwu, said the new system would block all the loopholes and drains in the lottery business so that all taxes and revenues payable to government are fully collected and remitted to government coffers.\n\nIn order to achieve this aim, Gbajabiamila assured that the recently approved peculiar allowance for members of staff of the commission and the enhanced salary structure permitted for them since 2015, would become implementable after the realisation of the new monitoring system as the commission would then have sufficient funds to meet its obligations.\n\n\u201cBoth the management and staff members of the commission are already being prepped with trainings and enhanced welfare package for the workers,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the statement titled \u2018Update on NLRC\u2019, he explained that the commission placed priority on improving the capacity and welfare of its staff, hence it prioritises the implementation of a more robust condition of service for staff.\n\n\u201cWe are always most concerned on improving the capacity and welfare of our staff in all our considerations and projections. We put the issues of welfare and capacity of welfare first. We are totally committed to implementing a more robust welfare scheme for them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTraining and further training of staff are also sacrosanct. For the agency to grow and meet the world standards, which is our ultimate target, our workers must grow simultaneously.\n\n\u201cIt is a thing of joy for me that the lottery industry that was more of a farce in Nigeria before I formally assumed office in 2017 is now better organized and thriving. In less than one year after I became the Chief Executive here, we started raking in billions of Naira for the government and it has continued to grow steadily since then.\n\n\u201cI am upbeat that in a matter of some few years, lottery shall become a major source of revenue for Nigeria. I am glad that I have a highly dynamic and supportive Minister of Special Duties, Senator (Dr.) George Akume supervising the commission. The Governing Board under the chairmanship of Alhaji Fatai Ibikunle too, has been awesome, while the management and staff members have shown profound dedication and commitment in the discharge of their duties.

          "text": "*Another killed as robbers attack gas station\n\n*Parishioners murdered in Nasarawa\n\nNosa Akenzua, Asaba, Augustine Kuza, Lafia and \u2018Tosin Ajuwon, Akure.\n\nHoodlums went on the rampage in Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State in the early hours of Sunday and set ablaze Nsukwa Divisional Police Station, leaving three officers dead in the process.\n\nAlthough, unconfirmed sources said that the burning of the police station was the handiwork of unknown gunmen who had few weeks earlier allegedly threatened to wreak havoc in Delta State, the Police Commissioner in the State, Mr Ari Muhammad Ali in a swift reaction assured that the burning of the police station will be properly investigated with a view to arresting those behind the nefarious act especially in the alleged killing of three policemen at the station.\n\nCP Ari Muhammad Ali who refused to confirm the killing of the three policemen said \u201cWe are still investigating the incident and we shall come out with details of the incident.\n\nWe hereby confirm that Nsukwa Police Division was set ablaze around 1am on Sunday and we are investigating the incident with a view to arresting those behind the nefarious activities.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to know if our officers were killed or not and until we are done with our investigation nothing to say much about the incident as it was rather unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSources said that the hoodlums stormed the Police Division at about 1am with AK-47 rifles and allegedly started shooting at the policemen on duty, an unfortunate situation as three policemen found could not escape from the scene like their colleagues in the heat of the gun battle.\n\nIt was gathered that Nsukwa Community with large hectares of oil mill farm lands had been under siege being perpetrated by suspected Fulani herdsmen including unidentified hoodlums who allegedly had also killed some persons said to be farmers in the area and rape of many housewives in the community.\n\nResidents of the community who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity alleged that killings have been perpetrated by suspected Fulani herdsmen within the area, adding that the police have done nothing to help the situation and however called on the state government to come to their rescue.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was palpable tension and fear of the unknown in the community with residents staying indoors, while mobile policemen have flooded the entire community to maintain law and order and prevent further attack.\n\nMeanwhile in Nasarawa State, unknown attackers suspected to be herdsmen have murdered a Catholic parishioner, Catechist Sydney Shirsha and two others in Amudu community, Keana Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe suspects reported to be armed with sophisticated weapons invaded Amudu village dominated by people of Tiv extraction and killed a Catechist who was preparing to retire for the day and two others in the midnight attack.\n\nThe attack which left several others with degrees of gunshot and injuries also displaced not fewer than 20,000 inhabitants from various villages within and outside some local government areas deserted for the fear of being attacked.\n\nPresident, Tiv Development Association (TIDA), in Nasarawa State, Comrade Peter Ahemba, while briefing Journalist in Lafia, the state capital yesterday, described the situation as unfortunate, regretted that the Tiv people of the state have remained under sustained attacks by armed herders for a reason not known to them.\n\n\u201cThe killing and displacement of the Tiv people of the state in the coordinated attacks have continued unabated since the first attack on Ajimaka community of Doma Local Government that led to the gruesome murder of nine persons about a month ago\u201d\n\nAhemba called on Governor Abdullahi Sule to save the Tiv people in the state from attacks stating that his kindred were being chased out of Nasarawa State and the seemingly planned elimination of the Tiv community succeed under his watch.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the state government towards restoring peace in the affected areas and we as law abiding citizens shall continue to count on c for protection of our lives and property.\n\nIt is unfortunate now that government is making frantic efforts to restore peace, the attackers and their collaborators are ensuring that the Tiv community is completely wipe out of the state\u201d\n\nThe Nasarawa Tiv leader also appealed to the state government to beef up security around the Internally Displaced Persons Camps, alleging that there are threats of more attacks on Tiv villages and IDP camps in the affected areas.\n\nWhile appreciating traditional rulers in the affected local governments for accommodating many of the displaced Tiv persons in their personal homes and public facilities, the TIDA President equally acknowledged their untiring efforts towards complimenting government\u2019s quest for peace and security.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer Nasarawa State Command, ASP Ramhan Nansel said the Command was yet to receive official report on the attack.\n\nAccording to him all the divisional officers (DPO) denied having knowledge of attack in the area.\n\nIN Ondo State, one person was feared dead at the weekend when some gunmen suspected to be armed robbers attacked a gas station in Akure, the state capital.\n\nThe robbers numbering about four were said to have stormed the station, Damorotex Oil and petrol station, located on Oda road of the state capital, on two motorcycles.\n\nSeveral witnesses who gave an account of the frightening event said the armed robbers shot sporadically into the air to scared away customers before gaining entry into the gas station.\n\nOne of the witnesses who spoke under the condition of anonymity told journalists that the hoodlums entered into the manager\u2019s office and carted away an undisclosed amount of money before finding their way to the gas station.\n\nHe explained that the fire from the gunshots injured no fewer than two persons who are customers buying fuel from the gas stations.\n\nOne of the fuel attendants in the gas station confirmed that the hoodlums shot one person who was trying to escape from the robbery scene.\n\nShe, however, refused to disclose the amount of money stolen from the gas station adding that the station has been shut down.\n\nTee Leo Ikoro, the Police Public Relations Officer in Ondo State who confirmed the robbery incident said the detectives from the police command have started an investigation into the crime already.\n\nMr. Ikoro added that the suspects would soon be arrested and brought to book and advised residents to be vigilant mostly at night.",

The Federal Executive Council approved the contract in March, a decision many analysts criticised as wasteful.\n\nNigeria has four refineries, owned by the government, but imports its refined petroleum products. The approval for the Port Harcourt Refinery was welcomed with mixed reactions as the country in the past spent billions of dollars on refinery maintenance with no success.\n\nThe NNPC has said the country does not have the required funds to build a new refinery. Mele Kyari, NNPC Group Managing Director, said in April that building a new refinery would cost the country about $10 billion which is far beyond the $1.5 billion earmarked for the rehabilitation of Port Harcourt refinery.\n\nHe also said the country would have to live with importation of petroleum product, especially petrol, for another four years if the country ventures into building a new refinery.\n\nIn March, the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, said the rehabilitation will be done in three phases of 18, 24 and 44 months.\n\nHe said the funding will be from many components including the NNPC, Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), budgetary provisions, and Afreximbank.\n\nThe minister also said a maintenance company would also be put in place to ensure an effective maintenance culture.\n\nIn its advertorial over the weekend, the NNPC said the scope of responsibilities for successful companies for the three refineries will cover long term and short term production/operations planning, production and operations execution, monitoring, reporting and optimization of operations, and more.",

          "text": "Agitators for the cre\u00adation of the Yoru\u00adba nation have dismissed police decision to monitor and investigate their activities, especially in Lagos State.\n\nChief Deji Osinbogun, a leader of the Yoruba World Assembly (YWA), maintained that since all these years of heinous acts perpetuating by the Fulani herdsmen, Myetti Allah, the killing and maiming of innocent Nigerians by the so-called Myetti Allah cattle breeders, the police have not been able to issue such threats or investigate the whole issue and bring out the perpetrators.\n\nThey wonder why police should now be saying that they would be going after those clamouring for their le\u00adgitimate rights.\n\nHe noted that it was disap\u00adpointing that the police which had failed to protect citizens, should be talking of investigat\u00ading self-actualisation agitators, arguing that the attempt might further deepen the disunity in the country.\n\nIn his reaction also, the Media and Communication Secretary of Ilana Omo Oo\u00addua, Adeleye Maxwell, said the decision of the police to investigate agitators was of no effect as long as the agitators carried out their advocacy for self-determination in a peace\u00adful manner.\n\nMr. Maxwell, who spoke on behalf of the Ilana Omo Oodua, said: \u201cIt is our rights to protest for self-determination, we are protesting for self-deter\u00admination in accordance with the law of the land, the UN and AU Constitutions, which Nigeria is even part of attested to this that self-actualisation is our legitimate right.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Constitution also stipulated that self-deter\u00admination protest and demand are our legitimate rights, the only limitation is that it must be done in a peaceful manner.\n\n\u201cWe have been very careful that our protests are peacefully conducted. Even the police are always on ground to ensure that the protest is not hijacked by hoodlums.\n\n\u201cThey are always on ground to maintain law and order. We have staged the pro\u00adtests in Ibadan. It was peaceful; no life was reportedly lost.\n\n\u201cJournalists were there with well coverage and there were no reports of loss of lives, nor was any protester arrest\u00aded for possession of unlawful arms.\n\n\u201cWe held the protest in Abeokuta in Ogun State. It was also a peaceful one. Some of our people were initially ar\u00adrested by the police, but they were freed when they found nothing implicating or con\u00adtrary on them.\n\n\u201cThey carry no arms, nor ammunitions. We are agitat\u00ading for our legitimate rights as stipulated by laws of the coun\u00adtry. So, I think the IGP is just saying something to impress his boss, as you know his new in that office.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Yoruba Na\u00adtion Global Directorate, the Yoruba shadow government, has expressed surprise at the decision of the police to place separatist groups in the coun\u00adtry under watch, describing it as a ploy to hound the agi\u00adtators.\n\nOtunba Demola Edward, Information Coordinator of the group, said that the Police that failed to protect life and property of the citizenry was promising to chase shadows.\n\nHe declared that the group was unperturbed by the threat, vowing that nothing would stop them from pursuing their desire for independent Yoruba nation.\n\nOtunba Edward said: \u201cWe found it interesting that the Police that failed woefully in its primary duties of main\u00adtaining law and order and securing the lives and proper\u00adties of citizens under the dis\u00adputable Federal Government is now threatening citizens of various nationalities within a mere geographical expression exercising their fundamental human rights of self- deter\u00admination under international law and jurisprudence.\n\n\u201cWhile we view this as a ploy to criminally harass le\u00adgitimate agitators for Yoruba Nation, we say unequivocally that no threats will discourage our determination to demand for actualisation of a sovereign Yoruba nation, which will save our people from the ongoing massacre and the impending genocide by the Fulani backed by government of Nigeria, who are hell bent on forcefully taking over our land.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening to note that the failed Nigeria state is evidently unsafe for Yoruba citizens, as economic woes, incessant kidnapping, raping, and murders by Fulani contin\u00adue to heighten in our land.\n\n\u201cWe reiterate that our quest to exit Nigeria under peaceful, civil and legal means was un\u00addermined by the failed Gen. Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that prop\u00adositions made to the Nigerian government by the Yoruba Na\u00adtion in conjunction with other ethnic nationalities have so far been ignored by Buhari\u2019s ad\u00administration, a Fulani leader under whose watch the atroc\u00adities aforementioned are now a daily common occurrence.\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say that the Yoruba nation is not ignorant of the Fulani-led administra\u00adtion\u2019s plans to execute a grand evil plan to conquer Yoruba land and subjugate Yoruba citizens on their original an\u00adcestral home land.\n\n\u201cWe urge all agitators for Yoruba nation, Middle Belt\u00adans, and Biafra, home and diaspora, to continue their liberation activities without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cThe Directorate takes cog\u00adnisance of the treaties of the Commonwealth, the African Union and United Nations. Our quest for self-determina\u00adtion is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nOtuba Edward, however, urged the Yoruba to remain calm and go about their busi\u00adnesses pending the exit of the nationality from the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nHowever, leader of the Yoruba Youth Socio-Cultural Association (YYSA) World\u00adwide, Comrade Olalekan Hammed, said there was nothing extraordinary in the police monitoring or in\u00advestigating the activities of agitators.\n\n\u201cAs the worldwide youth leader of Yoruba ethnic group, I champion our cause to ensure that Nigeria is re\u00adstructured because we believe that it is the solution to cur\u00adrent problems and the only way through which peace and development could be ascertained.\n\n\u201cIn other words, peaceful and orderly agitation is legit, but some of Oodua and Bi\u00adafra agitators have become deviants.\n\n\u201cThey are ready to kill and destroy their own region all in the name of agitation.\n\n\u201cAt least, nineteen police of\u00adficers have been killed in the last one month in South East by deadly agitators.\n\n\u201cAlthough, none of the Oodua agitators has become so devilish to that extent, but they all have to be checked, I mean, to restrain them from embarking on killing and de\u00adstruction.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it if the police decided to investigate those perceived to be heteroclite among the so-called separatists because destruction will only be a set\u00adback to our region.\n\n\u201cAgitation for restructur\u00ading or secession is part of the citizens\u2019 inalienable rights provided it is done lawfully without shedding of blood.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say that inves\u00adtigating the agitators is a way to hound them, no.\n\n\u201cWe could all see what is happening in the East, where many police stations were set ablaze and officers were mur\u00addered,\u201d Hammed said.",

          "title": "15 years after: N42.3bn Abuja-Lokoja road still work in progress",
          "text": "Communities along the Abuja-Lokoja Highway have blamed indigenous contractors and federal agencies for the slow pace of construction work on the 196-kilometre road project put at N42.3billion at inception 18 July, 2006.\n\nThe communities lamented the lingering deplorable condition of the road and the snail-speed approach to the project awarded by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration with a 30-month completion span.\n\nThey said the project had not only become a death-trap but den for robbers and kidnappers.\n\nThe Odumi of Omoko, a community along the highway, Mallam Umar Zozi, said they had resigned to fate.\n\nHe said: \u201cHad the construction of this all-important highway been completed on schedule, it would not only have facilitated movement of commuters and goods from the south and northern Nigeria, but the many fatal accidents caused by potholes which have claimed lives would have been avoided.\u201d\n\nCorroborating the claim, a CHISCO bus driver, Mr John Eze, said accidents on the dilapidated road were a daily occurrence, particularly from the Koton-Karfi- Chikara axis, stressing that the multiple potholes made it easier for highway robbers and kidnappers to waylay commuter buses, rob, rape and kidnap passengers.\n\nAmos Yakubu, a commercial bus driver, lamented the spate of accidents on the road, particularly from the military Check-Point after Chikara down to Ohuno, Gegu and other communities in-between up to Konto-Karfi.\n\nAlso, a commuter, Alhaja Binta Adejo, regretted government\u2019s decision to award the contract to indigenous firms, stressing that \u201cthe delay in the completion has made travelling on the road not only a nightmare but literally gives underworld persons ample chance to conduct their amorous businesses with reckless abandon.\u201d\n\nA community leader in Gegu, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cIt appears the federal government and its agencies have not been proactive in the quest to get the highway completed, otherwise, it would have compelled the indigenous contractors handling the project to complete it or revoke the contract and award it to a more competent contractor.\n\n\u201cIn fact, had the contract been awarded to a foreign firm, the road before now would have been tear-leather completed and even commissioned.\u201d\n\nComplementing the position of an earlier respondent, Mallam Zozi, the source said the communities had resigned to their fate because of the seemingly lackadaisical approach of the authorities to the respective contractors\u2019 delay on the completion of the highway.\n\nFurther lamentations\n\nIn yet another interview, a commercial driver, Mr. Oluwakemi Adebola said despite leaving Gwagwalada 5.00am for Garki, he would not reach his destination in good time because of gridlock.\n\nSimilar view was expressed by a truck driver, Abubakar Shehu, plying the road from Kano with tonnes of cements.\n\nShehu, who bemoaned the gridlock at Gwagwalada, said: \u201cIt is not first time, it happens every day as long as the construction work is ongoing. We don\u2019t know when the construction work will be completed.\u201d\n\nAnother respondent, Mr Akande Shitu, said motorists go through tough time getting to their destinations.\n\n\u201cWe pass through Kuje to the airport road before getting to Garki. He said those going to Kwali, Abaji axis have to follow Chukuku, a suburb of Kuje on rough road before getting to Kwali and Abaji,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe same fate often befalls us as civil servants when going to work. We just urge the federal government to up its game and get the contractor to do the needful and complete the job,\u201d said a civil servant who craved anonymity.\n\nBlueprint investigation further revealed people died on daily basis while crossing the road, especially the Okada riders who carried passengers owing to lack of pedestrian bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathaniel Hule, a building and construction engineer who spoke to Blueprint in Gwagwalada, said federal government needed to hasten up and address the factors responsible for accidents on the highway.\n\n\u201cInfrastructural deficiencies and budgetary constraints are some of the challenges militating against efforts to keep the roads safe. The government has to commence the rehabilitation and resuscitation of the highway system as well as the dualisation of major highways across the country.\n\n\u201cMany countries are passing legislations and bill to increase penalties against road traffic offences and bad roads; nothing is too much to reduce deaths to zero level on the roads in our country. That is supposed to be our goal.\n\n\u201cWe are advising government at all levels to support all efforts towards reduction of accidents fatalities on our roads, revamping of the lingering issues of bad road and substandard roads, absence of standard road furniture and limited technology in the enforcement and motoring process on the roads, \u2018he stated\u201d\n\nCAN laments\n\nPresident of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Samson Ayokunle, recently bemoaned the lack of urgency in the construction work saying \u201cIt is a shame to the country, that 15 years after, the construction of a 200-kilometre road is yet to be completed,\u201d and wondered why the authorities seem to be less concerned about speedy and quality delivery of projects.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who monitored the work, observed that \u201cfrom Chikara to Omoko alone- a distance of about seven kilometres-there are no fewer than 127 potholes, which is even relatively better than the condition of portions of the road from Konto-Karfi to Chikara. Some potholes are up to 4.5metres in depth and about 30 metres in width.\u201d\n\nThough the Kwali- Chikara section handled by SUKKU was in good condition as at the time of this report, some portions on the opposite section supposedly completed by an indigenous firm, had started wearing off from the shoulders while some portions had also folded thus making driving less than smooth and pleasant.\n\nHow the contract was awarded\n\nThe Obasanjo administration had initially awarded the Section 1 of the road at the sum of N11.2 billion, section 2 attracts N9.6 billion, section three at N9.6 billion, while section four gulped N11.9 billion respectively.\n\nThe N42.3billion contract sums had undergone upward reviews at different times.\n\nThe Abuja-Lokoja section 1; Juba to Sheda 42km to Dantata and Sawoe, Section 11 Sheda to Abaji, 57 km to RCC Construction Coy, Section 111- Abaji to Konto-Karfi Abaji to Bulletine Construction Limited and Section iv from Konto-Karfi to Lokoja awarded to Gitto Construction Coy.\n\nA brief on the section 1 of the project (Zuba Junction to Sheda Junction), also sighted by Blueprint, was re-awarded 18 September, 2018 with an initial completion date of the 30 June, 2019. However, the completion date was extended to 30th of June, 2021.\n\nContracts reviewed\n\nDuring a recent inspection of work progress on the project, Minister of State for Works Abubakar Aliyu, said the contract was reviewed in 2018 and the cost increased based on exigencies raised to N29billion by the present administration.\n\nThe minister allayed the fear of people that the project was jinxed by expressing the hope that it would finally be completed within the second quarter of 2021 to be commissioned by December.\n\n\u201cIt was reviewed in 2018 and the cost increased based on the time value of the money to N29bn, so the work has been going on and has reached over 95 percent completion. We are here to agree on certain grey areas that are making this road not to be completed at the stipulated time,\u201d the minister said.\n\nBlueprint gathered that among the grey areas are \u2018upgrade needed for the perfect delivery\u2019, inclusion of a service lane in the pick park within the Gwagwalada metropolis and needed approval for its inclusion by the authorities.\n\nThis was recently disclosed during the minister\u2019s inspection by the Executive Director Dantata and Sawoe, Mallam Nasiru Dantata, who confirmed that necessary approvals were needed to get the work done without further delay.\n\n\u201cIt is to be easy work once it is approved. So, this is the missing link, only one stretch in Gwagwalada that is remaining. Once we do that we have small things to tidy up and handover the job,\u201d Dantata assured.\n\nHe said observers were concerned that the \u2018necessary approval\u2019 may include extra-cost for the \u2018grey areas.\u2019\n\nFunding our challenge -FG\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint, the Director of Highway, Construction and Rehabilitation, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Engr. Funsho Adebiyi, identified funding as one of the factors delaying the project.\n\nHe, however, clarified that the present government had brought funding of the project under Sukuk intervention.\n\nAdebiyi also noted that soil texture in one of the sections delayed the space of work on the project site but assured that it would be completed soon.\n\nHe said: \u201cFunding was one of the factors responsible for the slow space of work. Before the life of this administration, the project experienced funding challenges. But now we are using Sukuk to bridge the funding gap.\n\n\u201cThe Gwagwalada exit point of the project is being fixed. And it will be ready in two weeks\u2019 time and will be open to traffic.\n\n\u201cThere are four contractors on that road, and the challenges of soil problems forced us to do a lot of self re-modification there. In a nutshell, funding and soil problems were what we were addressing and now that we are through, very soon, the project will be completed.\n\n\u201cWork is going on in the remaining sections of the road and it will be completed soon. We want to give the road users comfort on the route and I appeal to them to bear with us; we will soon be through.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "Dami Duro to FEM: Analysing Davido\u2019s 10 years of making smashing hits back to back",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nTen years ago, an 18-year-old stormed the Nigerian music industry with \u2018Back When\u2019 and \u2018Dami Duro\u2019 tracks that swept across Africa.\n\nFor many, it seemed like the regular case of a new artiste hitting luck in quick succession. But for those who had known the teenage sensation, this was the birth of a new star.\n\nThe first track, \u201cBack When\u201d was a faux attempt to explore a struggle narrative. But fortunately, David Adeleke redirected his narrative and embraced his privileged status with Dami Duro.\n\nAnd \u201cDami Duro\u201d, co-produced by Shizzi, was the perfect introduction to Davido. As one from an affluent family, his background afforded him the leeway to pursue music as a hobbie, but with Dami Duro, Davido stood in our faces, shouting at the top of his lungs \u201cI am from a rich family, I own my representation and no one can stop me\u201d\n\n10 years on, and Davido has walked the talk. He has had an enviable career laden with multiple hit tracks and lots of real awards to brag with.\n\nDavido\u2019s story is one that deserves to be told and this week, NewsWireNGR had a chat with Obinna Agwu, a music executive and talent manager to analyse Davido\u2019s success and detail how his career has been a win for the Afrobeats community.\n\nWhat is the Afrobeat genre?\n\nThere\u2019s Afrobeat and there\u2019s Afrobeats. Afrobeat without the \u2018S\u2019 is the music that Fela worked tirelessly to develop over a long period. From his own band Koola Lobitos to finally refining it to where he started Egypt 80 and everything, and it was because he schooled out there in the West, he took in a lot of their sound and all of that. But at some point, Fela felt the need to really stand apart from the music he had learnt and he wanted to make it more African than more make it more authentic.\n\nSo Afrobeat is the music today that emerged from the genius who spent tireless time in developing and working on it in the 60s.\n\nSo now to the Afrobeats with the \u2018S\u2019. A lot of people are going to say to you that unlike Afrobeat that is a distinct sound with elements, Afrobeats music isn\u2019t particularly a genre. It is just the overarching umbrella sound of the music out of West Africa.\n\nAnother funny thing is that the word Afrobeat was first coined or used by a Ghanaian-based DJ in the UK called DJ Atlantic. He was on radio at a time, and he had a show on a certain radio station and at that point he introduced a lot of African music. I guess after some time he felt the need to call it something, so that\u2019s where Afrobeat came from. Afrobeat is pretty much a sound from West Africa, the overarching sound of the umbrella music from West Africa.\n\nAfrobeats looks like the biggest export from Africa to the world right now, can give us a rundown of the evolution of the genre?\n\nWhen you talk about Afrobeats music, there are a lot of elements and a lot of people to thank. For example In 2005, people like MTV Base made their entry into Nigeria and to Africa. What those platforms did was that they gave us an avenue to expose our music to a bigger and wider audience within Africa and the world.\n\nHowever, at that time what we know as Afrobeats hasn\u2019t quite started to happen so at that time We had the 9ice, we had the P-Square, Naeto C, Ikechukwu, Mo\u2019 Hits, MI and all these people things, so as our music continued to grow I would say it was in early 2010 that Afrobeat started to form and shape up into something, especially with people like Wizkid, and there\u2019s really no way we would talk about Afrobeat victory without bringing the UK into it.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately because the UK ended up playing a huge role that helped in disseminating the sound support, and it was very obvious because we have a lot of Nigerians out there, a lot of Africans out there. So the UK is really much like an annex of Africa, so the UK and the regions of the UK and the people of the UK definitely played the huge role in helping to disseminate the sound support just like in everything, as you start to earn success, more people want to tap in, more people want to understand what you\u2019re doing. So before we knew it people like Drake came in and wanted to do stuff, J Hus plenty people, Skepta, so many people started to identify with the sound and these people came with their own huge following and their own audience. I\u2019d say that Afrobeat as a sound or as a musical consciousness , pretty much started in the 2010s and yes, we are like ten years deep into all of that now. So shout-out to Davido, shout out to Wizkid , shout to all these people who helped to push the sounds up.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Afrobeats rise without mentioning Davido, a man who recently clocks a decade in the industry. What do you think has defined his career so far in the industry?\n\nResilience and Passion. At the initial stage a lot of people did not consider David to be the most obviously talented person.\n\nBut one thing you could tell from David was that this kid was hungry, this kid wanted this thing, this Kid is going to do anything to get it , as God would have it he seems to have financial support on his path, but why I would not talk so much about that is that before David and even after David, we have seen a lot of rich kid , right? So money is not the only reason David is such a star. As a manager and an administrator, I have run with people who have money but their money is for their lifestyle and it\u2019s not for the music and when it\u2019s time to invest in music they would not, but with David , David realised that okay, I have the wherewithal to do what I need to do, he really put his money where his mouth is and he went all out for it.\n\nSo I would say resilience and passion first of all and over time we have seen this guy improve and get better and better. So it\u2019s not hard to say that David has been growing because over time he has shown us that.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Davido has undergone a lot of evolution to stay relevant. What has been the biggest?\n\nFor me, his biggest evolution has been his ability to spot great songs. His ability to work with amazingly gifted people and you must understand that sometimes these people are not necessarily the most affordable people to work it but David has displayed creative maturity over time.\n\nIn Nigeria a lot of people at his level wouldn\u2019t be open to come and say \u2018somebody wrote this song with me, or I took the song from somebody\u2019. But, we have seen David do that from time to time . From \u2018Gobe\u2019 to T Spize that wrote \u2018Aye\u2019 to collaborating with Peruzzi on a lot of songs, to working with Adekunle Gold on One Milli , so you can tell that David has a mentality that a lot of his peers and people do not have.\n\nHe is open , he understands music, he goes to a place and hears a song and says Yo, this song, I want this song, I need to sing this song, I would buy this song off you, what is it going to take , so over time David has shown that he is an incredible Musician and he has the ear for good music and also likes working with with gifted people.\n\nA lot of people say his special sauce is creating monster hits, how true is this? And how easy is it?\n\nHis special sauce is recognising monster hit, so when somebody tries to downplay David\u2019s greatness and say he is not talented, I\u2019m like yoo, it takes a lot of talent to spot hit, it was this boy who spotted \u2018Gobe\u2019 and he bought it, this guy who spotted \u2018Aye\u2019, and he bought it, he spotted even \u2018Fem\u2019.\n\nHe said some people were working at his studio, the song was not even meant for him, he now pulled up, he heard it and he was like yoo I\u2019m using this work, it takes talent to be able to spot those things you know and the ability to collaborate with very gifted people, all these things are talent, these are things his father\u2019s money cannot afford him. So yeah, Davido definitely has superpower for creating songs that are amazing.\n\n\u2018IF\u2019 was written by Tekno so you can tell that this guy is actually steps ahead of his peers. He is able to collaborate with the right people and he is able to spot amazing songs and say so you know what we are going to do with this one.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference in delivery even when one buy songs\n\nDefinitely, and he does that well. Like \u2018Gobe\u2019, he ended up not using the actual beat and he got.bI think he got Chizzi, and David has done so many things like this with his songs. So you can tell that this guy really has something, he knows something, something that can\u2019t just be learnt, something his father\u2019s money can\u2019t buy.\n\nWhat other elements of music marketing has Davido mastered to keep him going for over ten years?\n\nI think his use of social media has been very impressive over the years and that\u2019s why If I am not mistaken I think he even has more followers than Wizkid on Instagram.\n\nThat says a lot because Wizkid is quite a superstar. But for some reason, that followers count means that more people are trying to see something on David\u2019s side than on Wiz\u2019s side and it\u2019s just that when people love you and they admire you , they want to know more about you and David let\u2019s you in. You see his friends, you see his travels, you see his kids and even when he\u2019s ranting he puts it up there and another thing, David is so giving off his platform, that\u2019s something we have seen over time, I\u2019ve seen and then when he sees something that\u2019s amazing, he is always making sure he finds a way behind it through his platform I think in some way these things get to people and they love you more and support you.\n\nAlso, David is actually a businessman and he is very clinical about these things. If you get on YouTube and say you want to sit down and watch David\u2019s videos, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time there. And you know that these videos are shot by Clarence Peters. If you put it into naira and kobo, you would see that we are talking about hundreds of millions so a lot of people make money and they struggle putting that money back into their business but not David.\n\nHe\u2019s a great businessman and his use of social media has been very impressive and he has a heart of working with the right people.\n\nA lot of people have pointed at his humility in recalling Asa, as a key moment in his career\n\nYou see what he displayed, these are the things people love about David. David\u2019s ability to be honest and to just come out of a situation and say this is what it is.\n\nLike the project he did with Sony, that international project, David would openly say to you, I don\u2019t like that project, that project carries my name but I do not like it, I don\u2019t think it was me, I don\u2019t think I was allowed to do what I really wanted to do. It\u2019s not a lot of artistes who are able to look at their work and say ohhh I do not like this work .\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big level of honesty and sincerity and I think people can really connect with that. And on a human level when you have that type of understanding, it puts you in a place where you can learn and get better.\n\nTo Asa, I happen to be there to some extent. Asa started out working for his uncle\u2019s record company, Storm records, and of course you know Storm records at the time in Nigeria were like the biggest record label Nigeria. So that gave him a platform, that gave him access to do a lot of things and meet a lot of people. So I remember there was a time when Asa was hosting club nights in a lot of big clubs or Storm was handling PR for a lot of big clubs and it was him who would directly manage that relationship. So overtime, this guy had a strong contact base and I saw him first hand deploy all of this to push his music forward.\n\nAnd David is very clinical in his actions. He knows what he wants to do and he goes for it. We talked about \u201cBack When\u201d, do you know that he paid Naeto C for that feature? One would think that because Asa is his little cousin things would come easily, no, that feature was paid for and it was business, at that point how many people were paid? I think he paid about a million naira for him to do the audio and then be on the video. The video was shot by Clarence Peters, and over time we have seen how many more Clarence Peters videos he has made. Meaning that he wants the quality of the work to be good every step of his way .\n\nI can\u2019t say how the disagreement happened, but these things happen, at some point they fell in and then Kamal came in and a lot of things. But it takes a lot of honesty and sincerity for you to look at something and say, I should go back to this guy, this really loves me and was out for my best interest and he did just that.\n\nAnd from a manager\u2019s point of view, that was for me a key moment in the industry because I don\u2019t remember seeing stuff like that happen a lot of times. When an artiste falls out with his manager, and they go back to do their thing and honestly say \u2018you\u2019re the person who can do this thing, I\u2019m sorry about everything, let us just keep going\u2019. I strongly believe that as we celebrate David we ought to celebrate Asa as well.\n\nA lot of people think 2016 was Davido\u2019s biggest moment. I saw a video on twitter and it was a thread of different renowned celebrities singing those 2016 fire songs, FIA, IF and Fall. There was even a Kanye West sample. How did David crack the international scene with those songs?\n\nLike I said, David is very passionate, very driven, when he feels like it\u2019s time to get things done, he goes out to get it. Yes, he was already shutting things down on the Africa front, but that \u2018IF\u2019 victory was a calculated promo plan on their path.\n\nI\u2019m sure he must have sent them back some decent dollars to some announcers in American and possibly gotten some help with the international labels he was in at that time. This was someone basically saying I think it\u2019s about time we get this thing done and he went all out and then made it happen. It took some time but eventually the figures and everything started to add up. That was another coordinated plan by David and his team.\n\nDavido has amassed over a billion streams so far and I think that\u2019s very rich, how critical is digital streaming to the growth of Afrobeats?\n\nVery critical, and it is not like we have a choice because digital streaming is where the parties are right now. There\u2019s nobody who is trying to engage with your physical products anymore and there\u2019s nobody trying to buy your VHS or anything.\n\nSo it\u2019s not like we have a choice but it\u2019s a good thing people think that we were deemed enough to engage in those platforms and we woke up to the right technology and partnership of technology early enough. Imagine that we made all these things happen without our own numbers being registered on platforms like Spotify. Spotify just only came to Nigeria this year. So it just shows that despite all the numbers you have been seeing on Spotify, Nigerians in Nigeria our numbers are not even there.\n\nIt just shows how much better these things are going to be, and we have Audiomack, we have YouTube, we have Apple music, we have Spotify these brands have also realised that we Nigerians are an important market. And shout out to Nigerians in diaspora, they continue to push the culture forward. I like to think that they are the unsung heroes of Afrobeats music, because Nigerians everywhere and we can make music everywhere. Maybe that\u2019s the advantage we have over other countries because of the chances that you\u2019re going to find Nigerians everywhere. We are always travelling so It\u2019s easy for our music to travel as well. Hopefully, the internet data can get cheaper and more people can be able to access smart phones and all these gadgets and then stream it down and more people can be able to jam in and help grow this ecosystem.\n\nBurnaboy and Wizkid, recently bagged the grammy awards, will Davido get one soon?\n\nI think David is very close to it, because away from the music, the Grammy sometimes can tend to be like a popularity contest sometimes and, David is quite high up there and more than anything this dude has shown us that he has the ability to continue to bag out this heat. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any stopping that soon. This guy is not even 30 years old yet so David definitely has a lot of time on his clock to go out there and make it happen. He has the pedigree, he has the connections, he has the finance, he has everything, and ultimately he has music.\n\nI like to think eventually, David is going to be on his stage, hold his neck and say \u2018E choke\u2019 at some point.\n\nIn a recent interview with Ebuka, Davido said stuff like, Grammy no be by force. Do you think he can be as intentional as Burna Boy was or probably deviate from his light hearted niche?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think David has found his sweet spot. It\u2019s almost like we have forgotten but the huge positive uprising that happened last year, which is the EndSARS movement, David\u2019s song ended up being the song track for that whole movement.\n\nSo this man makes impactful music, he has the pedigree to back it up, He has the fanbase, he has the people, he has everything. So David has found his sweet spot. I don\u2019t think everyone has to sound the same.\n\nFor Burnaboy from the job, for those of us who were following him, everyone saw the view that at some point this guy called Burna Boy is going to win a Grammy. I\u2019m one of those people who wasn\u2019t surprised. I was literally just counting down to the day, he\u2019s that gifted, and his international appeal and his close relationship with Atlantic. Atlantic realised they had a gem in their hand and they really went out to position him like one.\n\nHow do you make an album like that and you do not have a Grammy? It\u2019s impossible. Diddy is your executive producer, Anderson Park is playing drums in there and Youssou N\u2019Dour is in there, you know, and all this other thing, and then you have the world\u2019s famous Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin\u2019s on that record. So every step of the way, you know this was a Grammy product, this was positioned for that and it eventually got it. Besides, a year before he had gotten a nomination, the one that he lost to another African legend Angelique Kidjo, so everybody just knew that it\u2019s only a matter of time, this guy is gonna get this nomination again and he\u2019s going to win. So, I have no doubt in my mind that as long as David continues to do his thing, he is going to win it at some point.\n\nWould there be any career regret if Davido never wins a Grammy?\n\nNo, there will be none. He is an accomplished artiste as it is. It was this year that Nas got his Grammy for the first time and there are plenty of other people that never got the Grammy but we know that these people are some of the finest artistes. Do you know Snoop Dogg never won a Grammy?\n\nSo there are plenty of other people like that, so sometimes these things happen. Maybe you dropped a project in a year, well then just so happened to be like a bigger or more popular project and then, you know there are those variables and these things that happen. So in my opinion David is really an accomplished musician, he has traveled round the world, he has met everybody, he has made money, he has made a clout, I mean what else is there to do? At this point he just needs to keep making music because that is what he has feelings for.\n\nWhat can young hungry artistes out there learn from Davido?\n\nBe open to collaboration. Know that using a songwriter does not mean you\u2019re a terrible musician, sometimes you write alone, sometimes you need to sing somebody\u2019s perspective to give your music that bit of freshness.\n\nSecond, you need to show that you want it, you need to be hungry about this thing, like I said before, David is not the first rich kid we have seen, but we have seen plenty of them who didn\u2019t seem to have that fight in them.\n\nThird, you have to be passionate, this is what you love, submit to it. One vibe you get from David is that this brother has genuine love for music. Just follow your heart, be passionate, be hardworking and if you have money to put in, put it in, be an entrepreneur.\n\nI want to add something else, just in case we don\u2019t get to touch that. Let us not forget that in the history of artistes who run record labels, we possibly have not had anyone that has been successful as DMW. So away from being an artiste, even as an executive or a label guy, David has been hugely successful, Mayorkun is big, Perruzi is big, Dremo, all these other people, so unlike all other guys who have tried to start a label, even the people he\u2019s competing with, a lot of them do not have anything going on that level, but away from David being this guy, he has also successfully built a platform that is huge as well, so David the executive also deserves a lot of kudos.\n\nHas Afrobeats peaked with this Grammy win and its present level of influence?\n\nI do not think so. If anything, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re just getting started. I was recently saying to someone, these days it appears like the producers outside Nigeria are even starting to make better Afrobeats production or songs than us. People like Jay Five, people like P2J, there\u2019s this guy in Los Angeles who does work for Tiwa savage and Seyi Shay plenty of these people, these guys are making incredible stuff. You know how a black American cannot really really say hip hop is our thing anymore because in Asia they now make hip hop, Africans make hip hop, a lot of people make hip hop, so that\u2019s the beauty of your tradition on your product going across. It sort of gets to a place where it feels like it\u2019s no longer yours anymore because a lot of people have now bought into your product and they love it so I see that happening with Afrobeats.\n\nAnother thing is that these guys are still young and they\u2019re going to continue making music. Wizkid is a big superstar, look at what he did with Made in Lagos, so projects like that help to reinforce the importance of this genre, people like Burna Boy, Burna Boy is only just getting started, Davido is a young man, he\u2019s just getting started, let\u2019s not even talk about the younger people who are coming behind them, Buju, Joeboy, Fireboy DML, Tems, all these people, so I think we\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nHow can the government key into the million dollars Afrobeats industry now and provide active and actual beneficial support to the growth of the industry now?\n\nMaybe that ship might have sailed because before we got into this digital age, we used to beg the government to come and help us stop piracy, come and help us stop this people who are creating our CDs and selling, come and help us stop these people in Alaba who are faking our products, but now with digital, nobody even cares about them anymore, so you find out that more and more we don\u2019t even need to talk to these people, we don\u2019t need them for anything. The labels have stepped up, were getting investments, international labels are coming in to partner with our local guys here, we have big artiste development and artiste relation companies like Platoon, like ONErpm, like Empire, like Orchard and all this people coming to Nigeria to set up shop, so it appears that through our own sheer determination and hard work, we have taken this thing to a level where it has really taken off, all the government can do is to congratulate people where the would help us.\n\nSo there\u2019s no role left for the government now?\n\nPerhaps that ship has sailed, so maybe they should perhaps help us add more event centres, you know just put in laws and regulations that help people to do business more easily. But generally, the success has gone beyond them.\n\nFans of Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy are always pitching against themselves on social media. Is this beneficial to the artistes or can it be very damaging to their career and industry growth in the long term?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Because these people are the people who speak up and drum up support for these people that helps to take them to the next level. So now the onus is on the artistes and their handlers to understand that hey, you people must remain friends ooh. You must know that these people would always come with these competitive problems but you guys must know that hey, fans are just doing what fans do.\n\nHowever the competitiveness is what makes it fun. A lot of times, if there\u2019s no competition people are not really bothered to go the extra mile, so there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\nDavido coming to tweet and say \u2018Yo, my fans stop doing this doesn\u2019t change anything\u2019, yeah, you get on Twitter you would discover that there are a lot of handles that are dedicated solely to these guys and all they do is talk about them, tweet them and drop fights and everything. So at that point it is out of your hand, it is just up to you to understand that now it\u2019s part of the game, but these people are my brothers and we should not let what the fans say make us enemies but however, the noise that the fans are making out is important.\n\nObinna Agwu is a music executive and talent manager who has had in his clientele MI Abaga amid a plethora of other artistes.\n\nListen to his expert analysis of happenings in the entertainment industry on Listening Session Podcast",

          "title": "The Economist: Nigeria\u2019s economy is stuck in a rut",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 4\n\nRising oil prices will bring short-term relief, butmay delay essential reforms.\n\nTALK THAT everything is expensive fills the air at a market in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital. Since February the minibus fare from home to the market has doubled, says Emmanuel Mokwe, who sells kitchen utensils. So has the price of food, he adds grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos,\u201d says Dotun Babande, who runs a juice shop across town.\n\nInflation is running at 18%. For food it is 23%, the highest in two decades. More than half of Nigerians are underemployed or unemployed. Before covid-19 about 80m of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic andpopulation growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023,says the World Bank.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic woes also help explain a vertiginous rise in crime. More people were kidnapped in the first four months of this year thanall of last year, according to Jose Luengo-Cabrera of the World Bank.This has added to worsening violence around three flashpoints: thejihadists of Boko Haram in the north-east; a long-standing conflict between farmers and cattle- herders across central Nigeria; and fighting between government forces and Igbo separatists in the south-east.\n\nCovid-19 has slammed economies everywhere, but Nigeria\u2019s economicmalaise predates the pandemic. GDP per person has fallen every yearsince 2015, when oil prices slumped (see chart). The World Bank reckons that by the end of the year real income per person in Nigeria, home to one in six of sub- Saharan Africa\u2019s people, will be at the same level as it was in the 1980s. Reform is desperately needed, but fiendishly difficult to enact.\n\nAlthough oil makes up about 9% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, it accounts for 80% of export earnings and about half of government revenues. A long slump in its price\u2014from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to less than half thatfor most of last year\u2014has squeezed the supply of foreign exchange.\n\nNormally economies would adjust by letting their exchange rates fall, making imports more expensive. This can be painful in the short term since it fuels inflation. But usually it helps boost exports by making them more competitive. If Nigeria could make, grow or mine more forexport, it would be less vulnerable to swings in the oil price.\n\nInstead, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has restricted imports in an effort to prop up the currency, which he sees asa measure of Nigeria\u2019s strength. In an attempt to conserve dollars, thecentral bank has banned those intending to import almost 50 items from buying foreign currency. Last month wheat and sugar were added to the list. In 2019 Mr Buhari closed Nigeria\u2019s land borders to goods to stop smugglers undermining local producers. Both moves have fuelled food-price inflation.\n\nThey have also hobbled manufacturing firms by making it hard for themto obtain inputs. Manufacturers would be lucky if they get 20% of the forex they request, says Muda Yusuf of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ajibade Oluwabukunmi imports medical equipment and uses the volatile black market, where dollars cost almost 30% more than the official rate. \u201cNigeria is in a shambles,\u201d he laments. Despite all its unorthodox controls, the central bank was forced to devalue the naira twice last year. Businesses are getting neither a stable currency nor access to dollars.\n\nThe government may slowly be changing its tune. Bismarck Rewane, an economist who is also on the president\u2019s council of economic advisers, says that \u201cthe futility of a Robinson Crusoe economy became very clear for everybody\u201d. The government is starting to pay more attention to exporters, he claims, pointing to the partial reopening of land bordersfor goods in December and Nigeria\u2019s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2019.\n\nYet sustained growth in exports requires more than just opening the border. Many firms are uncompetitive because they are hampered by red tape and government failures. \u201cGovernment is the biggest problem for business in Nigeria,\u201d says Bashir Abdulrahman of Credent Capital and Advisory, an investment bank.\n\nElectricity blackouts are maddeningly frequent. Roads are often poor and ports clogged up. Moving a container 20km from the port of Lagosto the city can cost $4,000, almost as much as shipping it 12,000km from China. Nigeria ranks 131st out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s ease-of- doing-business index. Although some industries, such as information technology, are growing, this is \u201cin spite of the government\u201d, says Tayo Oviosu of Paga, a mobile-payments company.\n\nThe government has tried to give the poor more aid to get them through the pandemic. It also promises to improve infrastructure. But spending on salaries and other annual costs chews up 75% of the federal budget, leaving little money to invest in roads or railways. With a view to freeing funds for infrastructure, the government last year promised to cut costly fuel subsidies. Yet that has been halted in the face of opposition.\n\nThe stalled reform is typical of Nigeria\u2019s troubles. For decades cash from oil has been used to subsidise things like fuel and electricity. The easy revenue also allowed the federal and state governments to getaway with abysmal tax collection. Worse, it fostered corruption.\n\nMany Nigerians have had enough. Between 2014 and 2018 the percentage who want to emigrate rose from 36% to 52%, one of thehighest levels in Africa. Rising oil prices this year will ease the shortages and boost government finances. Yet that may reduce the pressure to fix deeper economic problems, admits Kayode Fayemi, a state governor. Nonetheless, he believes there is an \u201calmost overwhelming consensus\u201d on the need to restructure the economy. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it,\u201d he warns, \u201cwe run the risk of disintegration.\u201d ?\n\nThis article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \u201cStuck in a rut\u201d for the Economist Magazine.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Alkasim Abdulkadir provides rare insight into the fight against insurgency, nation building and why Nigerian youths must chase money",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

          "text": "Attacks on police facilities in the southern part of the country appear to be worsening as more stations have come under siege by hoodlums recently.\n\nThe latest of such unfortunate incidents was the attack by gunmen on Nsukwa Divisional Police Station in Aniocha South Local Government Area (LGA) of Delta State.\n\nChannels Television gathered that the attack occurred in the early hours of Sunday as the assailants set some of the police vehicles on fire.\n\nWhile the police authorities in Delta have yet to make an official statement regarding the incident, unverified reports said three policemen were feared killed.\n\nSenior officers of the Nigeria Police Force led by the Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 5, Isaac Akinmoyede, accompanied by the Commissioner of Police in Delta, Ari Muhammad, have visited the scene to ascertain the level of destruction done.\n\nReporters were, however, barred from entering the premises of the attacked station.\n\nSeven Attacks In Nine Days\n\nChannels Television can confirm that the incident was the latest of at least seven attacks on police stations in the South reported in the last nine days.\n\nOn Sunday last week, the Mike Okiro Police Divisional Headquarters at the Trademore Estate in Umuahia, the Abia State capital came under attack by hoodlums.\n\nBarely three days later, Police Divisional Headquarters in the state \u2013 this time in Bende Local Government Area \u2013 was also attacked.\n\nA group of hoodlums, in a large number, were said to have attacked the police station in the night and set it on fire.\n\nDuring the incident, two policemen were injured but were taken to a hospital for medical attention, and the police command vowed not to rest on its oars to fish out the perpetrators.\n\nThe police station at Ozubulu in Ekwusigo Local Government Area was also attacked by gunmen on Sunday last week but the attack was repelled by officers on duty.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, it was a sad day on Saturday last week following the death of five police officers and the wife of an officer in the state.\n\nThey were killed by gunmen during an attack on the Divisional Police Headquarters at Odoro Ikpe in Ini Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom.\n\nFour days after the incident, a police officer, Edogi Bassey, was killed when gunmen attacked the Etim Ekpo Area Police Command and Division.\n\nOn the same day, gunmen also attacked the Police Station in Ika but were successfully repelled by the officers on duty.",

          "text": "Featuring as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics, he stated that those who have faulted the action of the governors misunderstood their motive of making such a move.\n\n\u201cWhat I understand from this whole meeting is that things are not well and I like the name they use \u2013 national dialogue\u2026 that is a call for peace, not for war. That should not be taken out of context,\u201d said Okorocha who now represents Imo West senatorial district in the National Assembly.\n\nHe added, \u201cSince 1960, has there been any time the southern governors have met to say that they ban open grazing? The answer is no.\n\n\u201cHas there been any meeting where the southern governors have said the Fulanis or the herders are enemies? No! And I don\u2019t think that is the intention of that meeting; if it is, then I don\u2019t think I am part of it.\u201d\n\nState governors in the South met on Tuesday last week in Asaba, the Delta State capital where they resolved to ban open grazing and movement of cattle by foot in the region.\n\nThey put aside their political differences and called for a national dialogue, as well as restructuring of the country along with fiscal federalism, devolution of powers, and state policing, among other demands.\n\nThe governors had also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation and convene a national dialogue to address the agitations by various groups in the region.\n\nWhile Okorocha commended the call for a national dialogue, he was concerned about the timing of such a call.\n\nAccording to him, President Muhammadu Buhari may not have the luxury of time to convene such a dialogue considering that he has about two years to complete his second term in office.\n\n\u201cComing to other issues of this national dialogue, my only concern about their statement is the time factor; If you look at it now, President Muhammadu Buhari has spent 70 per cent of his tenure as president, he has barely two years to go.\n\n\u201cAnd if you start forming this dialogue thing, I am sure it will take you six months to compose it and to set up a secretariat and others, that will take you up to January and by then, politics would have taken a different dimension and when will Buhari have the time to complete this whole thing?\u201d the former governor asked.",

          "text": "Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, made a winning return to Kano Pillars, providing an assist for Rabiu Ali to score in Sai Masu Gida\u2019s hard fought 1-0 victory over Adamawa United on matchday 21 of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).\n\nAsides from the dazzling run Musa made in the opening minutes, and Fahad Usman\u2019s curled free-kick in the 15th minute, the first-half action at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna failed to produce talking points.\n\nAdamawa United showed Pillars no respect. They contested aerial balls, chased the game, and took it to their opponents. The first half ended goalless.\n\nPillars doubled their efforts in the second half. In the 70th minute, they cracked the walls of Adamawa United when Rabiu Ali was brought down in the box and a penalty was awarded to Pillars.\n\nAli stepped up to the task and sent the ball to the heavens. Relief for the visitors. That\u2019s the first time the reliable Ali will be missing from the spot this season.\n\nTen minutes later, he made amends for his miss when he received a fine pass from Musa to score his eighth goal of the season. That goal meant so much to Pillars league ambition.\n\nSai Masu Gida have now recorded 12 wins this season, they are third on the log. It\u2019s the 13th defeat for Adamawa United and they are still bottom of the log.\n\nUnstoppable Akwa United\n\nAkwa United extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches with a 2-0 victory over Dakkada FC in the Uyo derby. Man on fire, Charles Atshimene scored both goals for coach Kennedy Boboye\u2019s team.\n\nAs early as 10 minutes into the match, Atshimene received an assist from Etim Matthew to smash Akwa United into the lead from 15 yards.\n\nWhen the second half resumed, Atshimene wasted no time in securing his brace. Assisted by Akarandut Orok, he curled in the ball from 20 yards to score his 6th goal of the season. The win ensured Akwa United stays unbeaten with 40 points now and retain the top position on the log.\n\nAkwa United\u2019s next match is a home fixture against Rangers International Football Club.\n\nKwara United returned to winning ways with a 2-0 win over Plateau United. Coach Abdullahi Biffo\u2019s team lost top spot position after losing to Nasarawa United on matchday 20. Still the surprise team of the season, the Harmony Boys are second on the log, they are still unbeaten at home and yet to drop below the top four.\n\nAway Teams Prevail\n\nMatchday 21 produced a tale of away victories. Four!\n\nIn Ozoro, MFM Football Club of Lagos stunned Warri Wolves 0-2 to keep their season\u2019s hopes alive.\n\nFirst-half goals from Ifeanyi Onyebuchi and Clement Ogwu secured the 7th win of the campaign for the Olukoya boys who are now 13th on the log. The hosts had a chance to pull one back in the 68th when they were awarded a penalty but Mark Daniel failed to score from the spot.\n\nHe sent the goalkeeper the wrong way, but his effort went wide. Warri Wolves were condemned to an 11th defeat this season, they\u2019ve won just 5 games and dropped to 17th on the log.\n\nNasarawa United travelled to Bauchi to secure a crucial 1-2 win over Wikki Tourists. The Solid Miners needed to consolidate on their 2-1 victory over Kwara United on Matchday 20 and they did just that. Same guys who got the job done in Lafia, continued their fine form in Bauchi.\n\nIt was the home side that opened the scoring in the 22nd minute through Manu Garba. It didn\u2019t take long before Anas Yusuf leveled up for the visitors. Silas Nwankwo scored the winner in the opening minutes of the second to seal the 6th spot on the log for coach Bala Nikyu\u2019s team.\n\nIn Enugu, an early goal scored by Godwin Aguda from close range was good enough to give Rivers United victory over Rangers International FC. It is the 6th defeat of the season for the Flying Antelopes who were hoping to consolidate their chase for the top spot. The win shot the Pride of Rivers into the top four.\n\nThe Struggles of Sunshine Stars, FC Ifeanyi Ubah\n\nFC Ifeanyi Ubah struggles continued with a 2-0 loss to Lobi Stars in Makurdi. Ossy Martins and Monday Akile goals gave coach Kabiru Dogo\u2019s team their 9th win of the season.\n\nIn Owerri, Heartland FC made it back-to-back wins in the league with a 2-0 win over Katsina United.\n\nThe first half by Bright Onyedikachi and Kelechi Chimezie secured maximum points for coach Fidelis Ilechukwu\u2019s team and shot them to 7th on the table.\n\nIn Akure, the winless run of Sunshine Stars continued after they played a goalless draw with Jigawa Golden Stars. Coach Gbenga Ogunbote\u2019s team have failed to record a win since their matchday 7 victory over Rangers International. It\u2019s now 14 games without a win and they are comfortably in the relegation zone.\n\nNIGERIA PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE\n\nMatchday 21 Results\n\nKano Pillars 1 Adamawa United 0\n\nDakkada FC 0 Akwa United 2\n\nKwara United 2 Plateau United 0\n\nWarri Wolves 0 MFM FC 2\n\nWikki Tourists 1 Nasarawa United 2\n\nRangers Int\u2019l FC 0 Rivers United 1\n\nLobi Stars 2 FC Ifeanyi Ubah 0\n\nHeartland FC 2 Katsina United 0\n\nSunshine Stars 0 Jigawa Golden Stars 0",

          "text": "Widespread gasoline shortages along the US East Coast began to ease slightly on Saturday as the operator of the nation\u2019s biggest fuel pipeline said it was back to delivering \u201cmillions of gallons per hour\u201d following last week\u2019s cyberattack.\n\nShips and trucks were deployed to fill up storage tanks after the six-day Colonial Pipeline shutdown, the most disruptive cyberattack on record, triggered widespread panic buying that left filling stations across the U.S. Southeast dry.\n\n\u201cWe have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the markets we serve,\u201d said the company, which had begun gradual restart of the pipeline on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 13,400 gas stations surveyed in the east and south by fuel tracking app GasBuddy were experiencing outages on Saturday, down from 16,200 early the previous day.\n\nOn Saturday evening, about 75% of gas stations in Washington, D.C. were still without fuel, an improvement from Friday\u2019s figure of 88%, the app showed. Shortages also eased in North Carolina and Virginia, but were about the same in Georgia.\n\nUS gasoline demand dropped 12.6% from the previous week, probably due to an easing of \u201ccrazed\u201d panic buying just after the pipeline shut, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\n\nThe nationwide average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $3.04 on Saturday, from $2.96 a week ago, according to AAA.\n\nThe pipeline outage accelerated increases in gasoline prices that were \u201calready rising due to higher crude prices and demand ahead of Memorial Day,\u201d said AAA spokeswoman Ellen Edmonds.\n\nShe was referring to the May 31 holiday that traditionally kicks off the U.S. summer driving season.\n\nPlaces served by the pipeline saw the biggest price jumps this week \u2013 with Georgia and the Carolinas up 20 cents per gallon or more \u2013 but they should also see prices decline again as supplies improve, Edmonds said.\n\nFlorence, South Carolina had the nation\u2019s biggest price increase at 30 cents, while prices rose 9 cents in D.C.\n\nShips deployed under emergency waivers were also moving fuel from U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to the northeast, while 18-wheel tanker trunks were ferrying gasoline from Alabama to Virginia, helping to stem the shortages.\n\nUS crude prices could edge higher as refiners process more oil to catch up from the gasoline storage that was drawn down while the pipeline was shuttered, said Robert Yawger, analyst at Mizuho Securities.\n\nThe approach of Memorial Day helps make \u201cthe sense of urgency supersized\u201d for refiners, Yawger added.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Dennis Li was stuck on Friday at a Sunoco gas station that was out of fuel. He had tried to find gas at four stations during the day, with no luck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running on empty to the point where I don\u2019t want to drive anymore,\u201d said Li, who is from Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nThe hacking group blamed for the attack, DarkSide, said it had hacked four other companies including a Toshiba subsidiary in Germany.\n\nColonial Pipeline has not determined how the initial breach occurred, a spokeswoman said this week. The 5,500-mile (8,900-km) pipeline carries 100 million gallons of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel each day to East Coast markets from Texas refineries.\n\nColonial has not revealed how much money the hackers were seeking or whether it paid. Bloomberg News and the New York Times said it paid nearly $5 million.\n\nColonial said it would resume on Monday its regular nomination process, in which shippers seek space on the line.\n\nIt released a revised schedule to shippers, with estimated delivery dates. The schedule suggested that diesel loaded in Atlanta on Friday would arrive at the northernmost point in Linden, New Jersey, 10 days later, as would gasoline.\n\nSteve Boyd, a senior managing director at fuel delivery firm Sun Coast Resources, estimated that with gasoline moving on the pipeline at half Colonial\u2019s normal speed, it could take 12 to 20 days for new deliveries from Gulf Coast refineries to reach Linden.\n\nSun Coast has 75 trucks taking supplies from terminals in Alabama and Georgia to retailers as far away as Virginia.\n\n\u201cIf customers need us for another week or three weeks, we\u2019ll be there,\u201d said Boyd.",

          "text": "The British Museum, the world\u2019s first national public museum, currently holds 700 pieces of the Benin Bronzes collection, more than any other museum and other institutions globally, a former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. John Campbell has said.\n\nCampbell, however, acknowledged that the authorities of the British Museum had agreed \u201cto return the Benin Bronzes collection once the Edo Museum of West African Art, currently under construction in Benin City is completed.\u201d\n\nHe gave this figure in a blog post titled \u201cGermany to Return Some African Art to Nigeria\u201d published on the website of Council for Foreign Relations (CFR), a US non-profit think-tank specialising in international affairs on Wednesday.\n\nMore than a century after British soldiers looted a collection of priceless artifacts from the Kingdom of Benin, some of the Benin bronzes are heading back to Nigeria \u2013 with strings attached.\n\nConsequently, more than 1,000 of the bronzes are held at museums across Europe, with the most valuable collection at the British Museum in London despite that the federal government had canvassed the return of the artifacts since the country gained independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Dialogue Group (BDG) had struck a deal to return some of the most iconic pieces in the historic collection on a temporary basis to form an exhibition at the new Benin Royal Museum in Edo State within three years.\n\nBut in his blog post, Campbell wrote that the German Minister of Culture, Monika Gr\u00fctters had announced plan to return hundreds of art objects to Nigeria.\n\nCampbell, currently Ralph Bunche Senior fellow for Africa Policy Studies said the origin of the artifacts \u201cis the Benin Royal Palace\u2014located in Benin City situated in Southern Nigeria\u2014looted and destroyed by the British in 1897.\n\n\u201cThe Germans, however, were not in Edo and, presumably, the objects from there were looted objects purchased on the international art market and then donated to German museums.\n\n\u201cThe German decision has raised pressure on London\u2019s British Museum\u2014which holds seven hundred pieces of the Benin Bronzes collection, more than any other museum\u2014and other institutions to lend or return bronzes to Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, according to the former ambassador, as few as 50 pieces of the iconic artifacts remain in Nigeria at present after the looting of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897.\n\nHe said: \u201cCalls for the return of art acquired by Western countries during the colonial period is an old song. Some countries, especially where national identity is weak, see the return of art as a dimension of nation-building.\u201d\n\nSince the nineteenth century, the former US envoy noted that the Greeks had agitated for the British return of the Parthenon sculptures (the \u201cElgin Marbles\u201d).\n\nHe added that the Greek perspective \u201ctakes for granted that the art produced in a particular locale uniquely belongs to the people who live there now, hence the importance of its physical repatriation.\n\n\u201cAnother perspective is that art belongs to humanity as a whole. What matters in that case is the art\u2019s accessibility to all who wish to see and study it and its conservation and security, not its physical location.\n\n\u201cAn issue with respect to the return of African art to Africa has been the lack of places where it could be exhibited, stored securely, and curated. That appears to be changing. The Edo Museum is designed to be a world-class facility.\u201d\n\nHowever, Campbell observed that the museum was located in \u201ca poor, increasingly unstable country. Where sustainable funding will come from or how security of the art can be maintained is unclear.\n\n\u201cThe sponsors of the Edo Museum are looking toward rotating exhibits of artwork to be borrowed from European and American collections and then returned.\n\n\u201cSuch an approach might satisfy those who see the art as a badge of their ethnic or national identity and those who see the art as belonging to all of humanity.\u201d\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",
