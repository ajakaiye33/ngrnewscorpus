          "text": "By Godwin Oritse\n\nAS the suspension of the embattled Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala Usman continue to raise dust, stakeholders in the Nigerian maritime industry have called on the Federal Government to handle the issue of alleged non-remittance of revenue with utmost care and ensure that a fair hearing is given to the affected ex-Chief Executive.\n\nSpeaking to Vanguard Maritime Report on this, a maritime lawyer, Barrister Osuala Nwagbara, said as a matter of fair hearing in law, Usman must be given the opportunity to defend herself.\n\nNwagbara also said that it was important for the matter to be handled properly because the office of the Managing Director of NPA is beyond Hadiza Bala Usman.\n\nREAD ALSO Three dead, four injured in Ogun gas explosion\n\nHe said: \u201cIf anybody is accused of wrongdoing in the course of discharge of job, such persons are supposed to be given opportunity to refute or to deny the allegations against them. That is to meet the principles of fair hearing before taking a decision on an allegation.\n\n\u201cWhether that procedure is followed or not in the removal of a person who is employed to office, it would not serve as a stoppage to the exercise of power of removal. Whether you query a person or not, would not stop you from taking a decision one way or the other, if you do not want to retain the person in the office.\n\n\u201cThe only implication it would have is on what happens to that person and that office. For instance, you have removed the person without giving the person a fair hearing; it is for the court to determine.\n\n\u2018\u2018Where for instance a person has a job, which has statutory flavour which is that the office has a fixed tenure, the removal is invalid.\n\n\u2018\u2018When you say that an employment has statutory flavour, it means that you cannot terminate that employment for the period that the office is supposed to last, except for a very serious infraction which must have been duly established.\n\n\u201cBut, if you remove me without giving me a fair hearing like people are alleging in this case, it means I remain in office in the eyes of the law until the term expires and I am entitled to all my salaries and benefits of the office.\n\n\u201cHowever, if due process has been followed. That is if she has been queried, answered and it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that she has offended the rules of her office; she betrayed the oat of office, or she has committed serious infractions of office, which suppose to be sacred, then she can be removed and it stands in the eye of the law.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Coordinator, Save Nigeria Freight Forwarders, Dr Osita Chukwu, said: \u201cAs far as I am concerned, the woman has done well. Probably, she does not want to succumb to their call as regards to monetary benefits, because some of them frame up somebody, even though you have done a good job.\n\n\u201cThis suspension is to ridicule the whole maritime sector. For me it\u2019s a very unfortunate situation. We were thinking that NPA has arrived taking cognizance of what the woman is putting in place.\n\n\u201cShe has been the one making moves to reform the industry, a lot of things that were not done before now were done by her such as automation and seamless operations in NPA.\n\n\u2018\u2018If they just push her out like that, I see a setback to the reforms. Despite several intimidations, she has continued with her work, even during the #EndSars she did not relent, only for her to be rewarded this way.\u201d",

          "text": "The reported attempt by burglars to break into the residence of the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari has been generating different reactions on social media.\n\nWhile the debate on if the event happened in the Villa or on the street close to the villa continues, issues of security has become a thing of major concern for citizens in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nLast week, a member of the House of Representatives, Nicholas Ossai from Delta State reported a case of burglary at his office located at the National Assembly complex, which is within the Three Arms Zone in Abuja.\n\nMr Ossai raised a point of order on personal explanation. He informed the House that his office was burgled and computers and other items were carted away from his office. The Speaker responded that the leadership will be meeting with the management of the National Assembly to discuss the \u201cdegrading level of security at the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nBefore the incidence of theft at the office of the lawmaker, there had been increasing security presence at the National Assembly with an increase in the number of checkpoints.\n\nTwo weeks ago, following a mass protest by legislative aides over 22 months of unpaid arrears, a combined team of police and sergeant at arm created an extra security presence at some of the entrances, with extra scrutiny of ID cards and visitor\u2019s tags of those going into the complex.\n\nIt is unknown if these new security measures have anything to do with the alarm raised by the Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, who said terrorists are infiltrating his state, a neighbouring State to the FCT. Back in January, the governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule also raised a similar alarm on activities of Boko Haram in his State, another State that shares a boundary with the FCT.\n\nFurthermore, activities of the unknown gunmen suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), an armed group of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOD), have raised security concerns across the country.\n\nOn Monday, police released a statement that IPOB is planning to attack Lagos.\n\nHow vulnerable is the National Assembly\n\nThe National Assembly sees a lot of traffic daily, and more during sitting days of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There are 469 members of the National Assembly (109 senators and 360 Reps), each with support staff that ranges from 3-5. Also, there is National Assembly bureaucracy and visitors that regularly flock to the complex.\n\nThere are two external gates at the complex, one at the Eagle Square axis and the OSGF axis. And there are three internal gates. One via the main entrance, second, through the annexe (Close to SGF) and other gate linking the Presidential Villa to the National Assembly.\n\nDespite this, the management of the institution has failed to create a uniform identification system for workers, journalists and visitors to the complex. Several journalists who work at the complex are given a temporary pass, while some are using \u2018paper pass\u2019.\n\nMore importantly, the security scrutiny has been on painted taxis and pedestrians, while lawmakers with official plate numbers are allowed into the complex without scrutiny by the security operatives.\n\nA driver of ride-hailing services, David Morrison, who spoke with DAILY POST expressed frustration over the attitude of the security personnel at the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThey will not allow me to come and pick you at the car park (outside the complex)\u201d Morrison said last week when responding to a request by a reporter of DAILY POST.\n\nNicholas Ossai, the victim of the latest robbery at the National Assembly did not respond to request for comments, while Wale Raji, the Chairman of the House Committee on House Services, the committee in charge of the welfare of the lawmakers did not reply to request for comments.\n\nThe Chairman of Police Community Relations Committee, FCT command, Ajibola Adigun, said the recent cases of burglars at houses of high profile persons look more than inside job than general insecurity in the city.\n\n\u201cThe attack or attempted robbery at the house of Prof Gambari looks like an inside job,\u201d Chief Ajibola Adigun, stated while speaking with DAILY POST.\n\nHe said that crime has reduced in the FCT under the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma. He, therefore, advised the Chief of Staff to assess those working for him.\n\nPrevious attacks on the National Assembly\n\nOmo-Agege and the mace\n\nOne of the most notable attack against the National Assembly in recent time has been the carting away of the Mace of the senate by some individuals allegedly at the behest of the current Deputy President of the Senate, Sen Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nThe brazen event that happened in 2017 sums up the vulnerability of the security of the National Assembly. According to reports, the assailants gained entrance because they were seen to be with the senator, who was then just a member of the Senate.\n\nShiite attacks\n\nIn 2019, protest by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) over the incarceration of the leader, Ibrahim Elzakzaky turned violent, as some members of the sect attempted to breach the security of the National Assembly.\n\nThat event led to the injuring of one police officer, and with IMN claiming that police shot several at its members.\n\nHow safe are the nation\u2019s courts\n\nAlso located at the three arms zone is the judiciary. The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal are in the same location. The Courts for now seem isolated from the general insecurity. However, during high profile cases like Presidential election or governorship elections, security at the court are heightened.\n\nA legal practitioner, Kuzayep Magaji said though there has never been any situation that went out of control either at the court of appeal or the supreme court, he, however, raised concerns over security personnel focusing on pedestrians, while allowing people inside cars to pass without check.\n\n\u201cThere has never been any situation where things get out of control. However, security personnel always check pedestrians more, those in the cars are seldom checked,\u201d he said.",

This nation is in great danger, unless we bring a new spirit and approach.\n\n\u201cSo, we challenge the government to look into security matters and restrain those using weapons of various sorts to intimidate people and creating unrest in the system. We expect a stoppage of the carnage taking place in the farmlands in various locations, and we, also, challenge the people at large to recognise that every human life is sacred. As fellow citizens, we need to cherish one another and bring a spirit of respect and mutual appreciation, so as to minimise and eliminate the bad blood that is circulating in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha Province, Most Rev. Valerian Okeke, decried the lopsidedness in the application of justice in Nigeria and called on government to be fair minded in dealing with the people.\n\n\u201cFor example, the government has found it necessary to disarm those struggling for self defence, while leaving armed herdsmen, bandits who are killing many and destroying people\u2019s farmlands. Instead of addressing the cries of the people, they are crushing those who are crying. The government should be fair in dealing with the people. We rely on God who never fails and we call on all men and women of goodwill to continue to pray, since nothing is impossible before God. Do not be afraid, for God will deliver us.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Magnus Eze, Enugu and Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives from the 17 southern states have lauded the Southern Governors Forum for calling for a restructuring of the polity, banning of open grazing and demand for true federalism in the country.\n\nThe southern lawmakers, in a statement by the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu and 22 others, yesterday, promised to deploy all legislative instruments at their disposal, to actualise the resolutions of the governors at their meeting in Asaba, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe members of the House of Representatives from the South, without regard to any other affiliations, firmly support our governors on the immediate ban on open cattle grazing across the Southern Nigeria. We hold that such is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements which has heightened security challenges with escalated killings and bloody attacks on innocent citizens, while crippling social life, economic activities and food production in the region.\n\n\u201cWe therefore support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\n\u201cWe also support our governor\u2019s restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring that will lead to the devolution of power, creation of state police, review of resource control and revenue allocation formula, as well as strict adherence to federal character principle in federal appointments in the shared interests of the federating states.\n\n\u201cWe firmly back the demand for the establishment and activation of other ports in other states of the federation, particularly in the south where such services are in very high demand.\u201d\n\nAlso, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), yesterday, backed the decision of the southern governors banning open grazing in the area.\n\nThey described the move as courageous and strategic, urging them to ensure that they back it up with the necessary legislation; which is the most potent strategy to prevent the monstrous and murderous Fulani herdsmen from overrunning their states.\n\nADF said: \u201cThe law to be passed in the Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. The effectiveness of this move depends on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people including the civil society organisations.\u201d\n\nADF also drew the attention of the southern governors and legislators to the obvious fact that their fate in the current struggle for survival is intricately interwoven with the fate of their fellow compatriots in the Middle Belt and Southern Kaduna.\n\nMASSOB on its part, encouraged the southern governors and other leaders to sustain the southern unity and brace up for the defense of their indigenous people. Leader of the group, Uchenna Madu, noted that their decision had rattled the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and, therefore, urged them not to relent in their ban on open grazing and call for national dialogue.\n\nMASSOB assured the southern governors that Southeast and the people were solidly behind the latest moves of salvaging their people from the marauding Fulani-terrorist herdsmen being brought in from some West African countries to carry out Islamisation agenda.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Molly Kilete, Abuja, Bimbola Oyesola, and Lukman Olabiyi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has called on Nigerians to jointly pray against kidnapping, banditry and desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of the country as a united entity.\n\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, quoted Buhari as stating this in his message to Nigerians and Muslims as they mark the Eid Al Fitr following the completion of a month of fasting.\n\n\u201cOn this blessed occasion, I wish that the Eid festival brings with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst all. Unity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one. It is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\n\n\u201cWe should jointly pray against the tragic incidents of kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of our country as a united entity.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithfuls during the Ramadan. \u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities. These are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022IGP orders watertight security nationwide\n\nActing Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, has ordered water tight security around the country to forestall security breaches as Muslims mark the Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nA statement by Frank Mba, force public relations officer, in Abuja, said the IGP\u2019s order was contained in a directive to assistant inspectors general of police (AIGs), commissioners of police (CPs) and other strategic commanders as part of efforts by the police leadership towards stabilising security, improving public safety and making the country a safer place for all citizens.\n\n\u201cBaba has ordered a nationwide deployment of police officers and other operational assets of the force for watertight security ahead of the Eid-el-Fitr celebration and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u2022PDP sues for unity, patriotism\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP) has felicitated with Nigerians on the occasion of Eid-el-Fitr to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday, urged Nigerians to use the opportunity of the celebration to unite in confronting the challenges facing the nation.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we are faced by all sorts of new surge in terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, vandalism; recklessness and insensitivity in governance as well as the menace of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, this is the time for Nigerians to keep hope alive believing that with trust in God and unity of all, this ugly phase in the life of our nation will surely pass.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi calls for prayers, sober reflection\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State called on Nigerians to take advantage of the occasion to reflect soberly and intensify prayers for the peace, security, unity and progress of the country.\n\nIn his Sallah message, Ugwuanyi, who felicitated with Muslim faithful, stressed that the religious event has great positive impact on the nation\u2019s efforts in surmounting its security, socio-economic and public health challenges.\n\nThe governor, therefore, enjoined Nigerians to continue to trust in God and embrace the cherished virtues of love, charity, peace and sacrifice as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Mohammed.\n\nWhile wishing Muslims the blessings and guidance of Allah, Ugwuanyi advised Nigerians on peaceful celebration and strict adherence to precautionary measures for the containment of the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\u2022Pray for peace, progress \u2013 Fayemi\n\nEkiti Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said the completion of the 30-day Ramadan fast was a rare privilege from the Almighty Allah on the faithful.\n\nThe governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, urged Muslims not to allow the lessons of sacrifice, humility, piety and submission to the will of the Almighty Allah learnt during the Ramadan season to go in vain.\n\n\u2022Ayade harps on peace and oneness\n\nCross River State Governor, Ben Ayade has congratulated Muslim faithful on the successful completion of the Ramadan fast.\n\nHe called on them to remain content and render selfless service to humanity in accordance with the lessons of the Islamic religious obligation.\n\nIn an Eid El-Fitr message to the Muslim Ummah by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, the governor said: \u201cEid al- Fitr offers an excellent opportunity for Muslims to break barriers and reach out to fellow Nigerians, heal wounds and work toward a united, peaceful Nigeria especially at this time our country is facing myriad of economic and security challenges. I enjoin muslim Ummah and indeed all Nigerians to employ a selfless approach in our dealings irrespective of religious, political or tribal affiliations and remain content with what we have.\u201d\n\n\u2022Tinubu tasks Muslims faithful on righteous acts\n\nAlso, All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, tasked Muslims to allow righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan guide their actions.\n\nTinubu, in a statement, yesterday said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding. We must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ramadan, window for national healing \u2013 Nwankwo\n\nAn aspirant in the Anambra governorship election, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chidozie Nwankwo, has called on disparate groups threatening the Nigerian federation to have a re-think by imbibing the spiritual lessons offered by Ramadan season.\n\nIn a message by his Media Adviser, Edward Dibiana, the governorship aspirant felicitated with the country\u2019s Muslim community for faithfully going through the fasting period, in spite of the harsh times.\n\nNwankwo, who is the Chairman/CEO of Wichtech Group, expressed hope that the country would yet again surmount the current challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cGiven the virtuous acts of piety imbibed during the Ramadan, I urge our kith and kin \u2013 currently led astray and operating as either Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers and the likes \u2013 to return to the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cEvery disagreement, be it in the family unit, business environment, community or country, is better resolved through dialogue. We must, therefore, use the opportunity offered by the Ramadan season to promote national healing, by forgiving ourselves. In deed, Allah\u2019s desire for humanity is peaceful and communal living, devoid of undue bickering. As true and faithful followers of God, we must join hands to ensure a restoration of peace in our land.\u201d\n\n\u2022Labour demands sacrifice from leaders\n\nOrganised labour has tasked leaders and citizens to make necessary sacrifice to rid the nation of the current grave insecurity.\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, in his Eid-el-fitr message said: \u201cWe must hear something, see something, say something and do something with every sense of love and patriotism to reclaim our dear motherland from the cataclysmic periphery that the enemies of Nigeria want us fall headlong into.\u201d\n\nWabba noted that the Eid-al-fitr takes place at a time that the country was plagued by fiery storms of insecurity, economic recession and social setbacks with very grievous consequences for workers.\n\nThe NLC president said labour also use the season of Ramadan to remember and salute members of the Armed Forces \u2013 the military, the police, the para-military agencies and the intelligence community \u2013 for their sacrifice, courage and commitment in the fight against terrorism and other forms of violent crimes.\n\n\u2022Pray for peace \u2013 Adegoke\n\nFormer Osun State gubernatorial aspirant , Kunle Rasheed Adegoke has felicitated with Muslims in the state on this year\u2019s Eid al-Fitr celebration which marked the end of the 2021 Ramadan.\n\nAdegoke, popularly known as KRAD, called on Muslims in the state to use the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr celebration to pray for the peace of Nigeria.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to continue with their closeness to Almighty Allah and their prayers for His intervention in the affairs of the country, even after the obligatory fasting period.\n\nHe stated that Ramadan does not just symbolise having a positive attitude during the fasting period, but represents a total change towards becoming good citizens who comply with the law and demonstrate patriotism at all times.\n\n\u2022Soun sues for peace\n\nSoun of Ogbomosoland, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi Ajagungbade III, has called on Muslim faithful across the country to pray for leaders at all levels of government.\n\nWhile felicitating with the Muslim Ummah, the first-class monarch, urged the political class to improve the common lots of the people.\n\nThe traditional ruler urged Nigerians to embrace forgiveness, togetherness and patriotism, adding that the traditional institution will continue to play its leading role in advocating peace and unity.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Private Secretary, Toyin Ajamu, Oba Oyewumi said: \u201cAs we celebrate Eid-el fitr, I call on Muslims across the country to sustain the teachings of the holy Quran and exemplary qualities of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in their pursuits. The festive season calls for sober reflection as individuals and as a people. People at the helm of affairs must prioritise the welfare of the people in their policy trust. As we mark Eid-el fitr, I implore Moslems to pray for the nation.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Atiku, Lawan, Saraki, Tinubu preach righteousness\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday went spiritual in the search for solutions to the insecurity ravaging the country with a call on Nigerians to pray for an end to banditry, kidnapping and desperate quest for power.\n\nBuhari, in a message he personally signed to celebrate Eid-el Fitr, urged Nigerians to shun the temptation to retreat into their communities.\n\nSimilar messages from former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu; and a former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, also tasked Nigerians on the need for righteousness and prayers for the nation to overcome its problems.\n\nBuhari implored the citizenry to pray against kidnapping and banditry and the desperate quest for political power expressed through blackmail against the existence of Nigeria as a united entity.\n\n\u201cWe must resist the temptation to retreat into our communities. I urge our political and religious leaders as well as traditional rulers to encourage our citizens to turn towards one another in love and compassion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile sending his best wishes to all Nigerians and Muslims across the globe as they mark the Eid Al Fitr the president said:\n\n\u201cUnity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians are imperative especially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges, which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we remember how we share, through our faiths, common bonds that should serve to unite us and not allow ourselves to succumb to those who seek to divide us, using our two great religions, for their own selfish advantages.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is noteworthy and delightful to see Christians breaking fast and in some instances, extending goodwill and gifts to Muslim faithful during Ramadan.\n\n\u201cThis model also shone through with Muslim groups joining Christian festivities.\n\nThese are practices that promote brotherhood and forgiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also urged Nigerians to continue to observe all COVID-19 prevention measures and celebrate responsibly during the holidays.\n\nLawan felicitated with the Muslim clerics in Nigeria on the completion of this year\u2019s Ramadan fast, saying: \u201cEvery true Muslim feels joy at participating in the Ramadan fast, which is a key obligation in Islam. May Almighty Allah, therefore, reward us for the spiritual voyage and grant our earnest wishes for ourselves, families and dear country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, due to the current security and economic challenges, Nigeria needs the prayers of every patriot now more than ever before to achieve peace, unity, and progress were the dreams of the founding fathers.\n\nHe assured the people that the government, including the National Assembly, will not waiver in its determination to provide security for the people to allow law-abiding citizens the liberty to live in peace and pursue their legitimate businesses anywhere.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us remain strong in our hope that Nigeria will become what we fervently want it to be: a nation that fills its citizens with happiness and pride.\u201d\n\nTinubu also joined Muslims in marking the completion of Ramadan fast.\n\nIn a message issued yesterday by his Media Office, the former Lagos State governor stated that as Muslims, they had fasted and prayed in a special way during this holy month.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow that the holy month of Ramadan is ending, we must counsel ourselves not to forget its great lessons. We must be better than we were before. We must treat each other with more compassion and understanding.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better society free from want, violence and hatred. We must never condone and tolerate the works and words of those who would do evil or who would pit brother against brother, Nigerian against Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe righteous acts and efforts of Ramadan must guide our actions and conduct going forward. Let us put politics aside and continue to pray to Almighty Allah for our country and its entire people.\n\n\u201cLet us remember President Muhammadu Buhari and his government in our prayers that they may be given the requisite strength and wisdom to protect the nation, defeat the challenges that confront us and help establish Nigeria as a more prosperous and just land.\u201d\n\nAtiku in a statement said this year\u2019s Eid-al-Fitr come at a time when Nigeria was going through challenging moments concerning the security of lives and property and when a large number of people were hard hit by the ravaging scourge of poverty.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, we need to remind ourselves of our obligation to ensuring peace and unity within our family and in our neighbourhood at all times.\n\n\u201cToday, across Nigeria, there is a scary and growing tendency to mistrust along ethnic and religious lines. As Muslims, we know from both the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of Noble Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that no tribe or race is superior to another, except the one that seeks piety to the Almighty Allah,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by the Head of his media office, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu, said: \u201cThe current situation in our country requires a sincere change of mindset by all Nigerians. We should use this post-Ramadan period and the lessons we learnt from the fasting period to steer clear of any action which does not bode well for our country. This is a period when we all need to pray to Allah to once again pull the country back from the precipice.\n\n\u201cWith the level of insecurity and economic crisis which have combined to worsen the rate of poverty in Nigeria, all Nigerians must unite and demonstrate patriotism that will help our country overcome the present challenges.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I commend our security agencies at the frontline and pray that Almighty God will protect and give them victory over the insurgents and other non-state actors inflicting violence on our country. May Allah heal our land of any form of affliction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist outstanding allocations are paid\n\n\u2022Say pact must be backed by law\n\nBy Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nStriking judicial and legislative workers have given fresh conditions to suspend their industrial action, insisting that the federal government should prevail on governors to immediately release all outstanding allocations due to the other two arms of government, still in their custody since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe workers restated that they would not negotiate the provisions of the constitution on financial autonomy for the two arms of government and demanded that the governors should immediately set in motion the process of establishing the fund allocation committees in all the states.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the leadership of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) made the demands in a written response to the proposals made by state governors and the federal government on how to resolve the dispute over financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in each state of the federation.\n\nThe federal government and the governors of the 36 states had earlier agreed on a revenue-sharing formula to resolve the raging dispute over the full implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nThe new proposal, which was given to the leadership of both the workers\u2019 unions at a conciliatory meeting last Thursday in Abuja, sought to replicate the federal revenue-sharing structure in the states.\n\nTHISDAY had reported exclusively that under the new template, the governors would establish, within 45 days of the agreement, States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) to share revenues among the executive, the judiciary and the legislature, the same way the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares revenue between the federal, states and local government councils.\n\nBut in their response to the government\u2019s proposal, which was submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Tuesday, the striking workers also demanded that a law be immediately enacted to back the implementation of any agreement reached with the governors.\n\nA top official of one of the unions told THISDAY that the workers were also demanding that \u201cin consonance with the Executive Order 10, that whatever monies that are in the possession of the governors and are yet to be disbursed should be disbursed immediately.\u201d\n\nHe added that the unions are also insisting that there should be uniformity of the law setting up the fund allocation committees to ensure a common template for revenue sharing in all the 36 states of the federation.\n\nThe official said: \u201cWe demand that there should be a law in all the states to back up the revenue-sharing template. In addition, in consonance with Executive Order 10, the governors should also ensure that whatever that is their hands that they have not disbursed are released. They should disburse it immediately. They should put in motion the process of setting up the State Fund Allocation Committee as proposed.\n\n\u201cThere should be uniformity in the law setting up the revenue sharing template in all the states. We don\u2019t want a variant of the law. It doesn\u2019t matter what a state generates. We know that every state will not have the same amount because some of the states earn derivation fund. What is important is that the sharing formula is the same.\u201d\n\nOn having the governors as signatories to any agreement reached to resolve the financial autonomy dispute, the source said JUSUN and PASAN insisted that each state governor should sign the agreement by himself and not through a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, in continuation of negotiations to end the dispute, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, on Tuesday held a meeting with the representative of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, on how to respond to issues raised by the striking workers.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting followed the receipt of a written response by the workers to an earlier offer made by the governors in a bid to resolve the lingering dispute.\n\nIt was learnt that Ngige, Lalong and others were not able to trash out the issues and had agreed to meet again yesterday (Wednesday) in order to allow for wider consultations.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that a meeting with the leadership of the workers may be convened tomorrow to iron out the remaining issues with a view to secure the suspension of the strike.\n\nJUSUN and PASAN have been on strike for over one month.\n\nThe unions are seeking the full implementation of the constitutionally guaranteed financial autonomy for state legislatures and judiciaries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Again, prices near $70\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has picked 16 consortia for its new crude-for-fuel swap contracts for one year starting in August.\n\nA report yesterday by Reuters listed the consortia to include major Swiss trading firms, Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, oil major Total as well as large Nigerian traders, Sahara Energy, Oando and MRS Oil.\n\nOther companies which qualified for the contracts, according to a list sighted by THISDAY include: AY Mai Kifi, based in Kano; Litasco, a South African firm; Bono Energy, Lagos; Duke Oil, an NNPC subsidiary; Eyrie Energy, based in Abuja; Asian Energy Services; Prudent; BP and Mocoh.\n\nThe contracts, known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP), are coveted since they are used to supply nearly all of Nigeria\u2019s petrol needs as well as cover some of its diesel and jet fuel consumption.\n\nThe companies were invited on Friday to submit commercial bids, which were due on Tuesday, according to the report.\n\nThose involved in the process said the list of winners was unlikely to change substantially, with the new DSDPs expected to replace those from 2019, which were extended until mid-2021.\n\nTraditionally, if a foreign oil company wins, then it is typically paired with at least one local firm.\n\nNNPC uses a DSDP mechanism to secure Nigeria\u2019s fuel requirements in exchange for crude, a practice that has gone on for years as all the country\u2019s refineries have remained comatose.\n\nIn an interview last year, NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said the DSDP had resulted in savings of more than $1 billion a year since its introduction.\n\nNigeria relies almost entirely on imports to meet oil product demand because of significant and prolonged operational problems at its 445,000 bpd of refining capacity.\n\nThe country consumes over 350,000 bpd of petrol with the majority sourced from Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices rose yesterday on signs of a speedy economic recovery and upbeat forecasts for energy demand supported by vaccinations against COVID-19 although waves of infections in India and Brazil curbed gains.\n\nBrent crude climbed 83 cents, or 1.2 per cent to $69.38 a barrel, earlier in the day, with West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude rising 86 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $66.14.\n\nAs at yesterday evening, prices of Brent had hit $69.86, a few cents shy of the much expected $70 while WTI was at $66.56.\n\nIt coincided with a monthly report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which noted that demand for oil will exceed the output of top producers.\n\n\u201cThe anticipated supply growth through the rest of this year comes nowhere close to matching our forecast for significantly stronger demand beyond the second quarter,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nOil prices were also supported by the outlook from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which on Tuesday stuck to a forecast for a strong recovery in world oil demand in 2021, with growth in China and the United States, outweighing the impact of the coronavirus crisis in India.\n\nPrices were further impacted by data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group showing that U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to May 7.\n\nThe fall came before the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a cyberattack last Friday, forcing the shutdown of a pipeline that transports more than 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that.\n\n\u201cThe other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation.

          "text": "A statement issued Wednesday and jointly signed by the SSF Chairman, Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti); Secretary General, Matthew Urhoghide (Edo) and Publicity Secretary, Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu), hailed the Governors for ruminating on the expediency and the need for speedy restructuring of the highly lopsided Nigerian nation, saying this will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\n\nThe SSF leaders stated that ushering of equality , equity and justice in the way the country was being run will wipe out ethnic tension, restore peace and stability and ward off agitations for secession that are now gaining tractions across the land. The Southern Senators also submitted that the deft and unanimous policy of the ban on open cattle grazing would help in reining in those hiding under cattle grazing to unleash terror of kidnapping and killing on the residents of the region. They appaluded the step taken by the Governors, saying it would serve as a buffer to wanton destruction of farmlands, kidnappings and carnages .\n\nThe Senators lamented how the Southern farmers were losing hundreds of millions of Naira to plundering of food crops through encroachments on farmlands and exposing the region to famine and acute food scarcity .\n\nThey said: \u201cAt this critical point of our national life when the economy was being bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens.\n\n\u201cAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\n\u201cMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping , raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\n\u201cWith this uniform resolve by our Governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914\u201d.\n\nThe Southern Senators Forum, therefore, encouraged the Governors to swiftly follow up on their resolutions by immediately approaching the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to working with the two arms of the parliament \u201cto ensure that their well articulated positions on the state of the nation, especially as relate to restructuring, State policing and the jettisoning of archaic traditional grazing methods, which fall short of global best practice standard and a potential threat to national cohesion and peace, are thoroughly and decisively addressed through the ongoing constitutional review exercise\u201d.",

He was planning to go to Kampala (Uganda) and travel to London, the United Kingdom, to see his doctors but they opted to meet him in Paris. He will be travelling on Saturday,\" a top source disclosed.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier today reported how Buhari planned to attend the inauguration of Uganda's tight-fist dictator, Yoweri Museveni, and from there let him visit the UK for treatment.\n\nBut the plan was later shelved and the decision to send Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to Uganda to represent Buhari was made at the last minute when it appeared that the UK trip was not feasible.\n\nTop presidency sources had told this newspaper that Buhari's health, particularly his dementia, had deteriorated recently, and he was incoherent at the security chiefs' meetings in the last two weeks.\n\n\"Buhari had wanted to travel to go for Museveni's inauguration in Uganda and now use the opportunity to go to London but they changed the plans last minute and sent Osinbajo,\" a top source had revealed.\n\nAccording to a release from the State House, Osinbajo would be joining several other Heads of State and Government for the swearing-in ceremony scheduled for Wednesday, May 12, at Kololo Independence Grounds in Kampala, the nation's capital city.\n\nThe Vice President, who also participated at the resumed National Security Council meeting presided over by the President at the Presidential Villa, later travelled to Lagos State, where he attended another function.\n\n\"He departs Lagos this evening for Kampala and would be accompanied by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, and the Special Adviser on Economic Matters to the President, Ambassador Adeyemi Dipeolu. He is expected back in the country later on Wednesday,\" the state House release reads.\n\nSince he assumed office on May 29, 2015, Buhari has embarked on medical trips abroad at least five times, covering a period of no fewer than 170 days of the five years he had been in power.\n\nThe following is a timeline of the President's trips for medical treatment; on February 5 to 10, 2016, the President took a six-day vacation in the United Kingdom, saying that his doctors lived in England.\n\nBetween June 6 and 19, 2016, Buhari went on a 10-day medical trip to England for an ear infection surgery. He extended his trip by three days to rest.\n\nOn January 19, 2017, the President was back in London again on a medical vacation.\n\nOn February 5, 2017, he wrote to the National Assembly, seeking an extension of his London medical leave. Later on March 10, 2017, Buhari returned to Nigeria but didn't resume work immediately at Aso Villa.\n\nThe Presidency had claimed that \"he was working from home.\" On May 7, 2017, Buhari embarked on a trip to London for another medical vacation. He returned after 104 days \u2013 the longest he had stayed outside the country.\n\nOn August 19, 2017, Buhari returned to Nigeria, and it took him a while to resume work because rats had reportedly damaged furniture in his office.\n\nThe Presidency had announced that he would be working from home.

          "title": "'Nigeria played a key role?' -- Here's a brief explainer on the Israel-Palestine crisis",
          "text": "The biggest developing international story this week is \u201cIsrael Vs Palestine\u201d. But what exactly is the problem and what is happening today? The answer to that question depends on who you ask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media reports are very likely to follow a pattern \u2014 pro-Israel or pro-Palestine; pro-Arab or pro-west; Christian or Muslim. It\u2019s a very polarising situation that seems to appear to simply be a struggle for land or space. But it is more; it\u2019s a heritage war.\n\nTheCable attempts to briefly explain what we know so far, and contextualise the role Nigeria has played in the agelong crisis in the region. Yes, Nigeria is somehow tied to this story, however little that may be.\n\nThe Genesis of the 2021 episode\n\nIt all started with law suits to evict 300 Palestinians from a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. The Palestinians then began to protest the possible evictions which involved about six families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan, Israeli police forces mounted a blockade around one of the holiest sites in Islam, where some protesters occupied. The site, which is in East Jerusalem, also houses one of the holiest sites in Judaism. It is called the Temple Mount by Jews and Noble Sanctuary by Muslims.\n\nHence, this site matters to both the Jews and the Muslims. Traditionally, Muslims will gather at these sites to pray during Ramadan. The tensions were brewing, Palestinian protesters were gathering, but on Monday, the broth of fury was ready to be served.\n\nIsraeli forces raided Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. This injured hundreds of Palestinians and a good number of Israeli security officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was the genesis of the most recent conflict. The BBC has detailed six reasons the clashes may be happening now.\n\nHamas responds\n\nHamas is a known Islamic resistant group founded in 1987 with the sole aim of liberating Palestine from Israeli occupation. To many Palestinians, Hamas is the saviour. To a vast majority of Israelis, Hamas is the terrorist.\n\nQuick Fact: Hamas in Arabic means Zeal, in Hebrew, it means violence.\n\nFollowing the raid in East Jerusalem, Hamas gave a 6pm deadline for Israeli officials to vacate the holy site. That did not happen, so Hamas struck Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow bad? Al Jazeera first reported that Hamas fired seven long-range rockets into Israeli territory. But Hamas said it launched dozens of rockets into Israel. Israeli forces used its Iron Dome Aerial Defense System to intercept at least one of the rockets. Hamas fired more, and injured civilians and killed at least one Israeli soldier.\n\nThe date of the strikes is even more significant because it coincided with what is known as Jerusalem day. On May 10, 1967, according to the Hebrew calendar, Israeli soldiers liberated the Old City of Jerusalem, reunifying the \u201ceternal capital\u201d of the Jewish People.\n\nThis day is celebrated annually. This year, it is marked by receiving strikes from Hamas.\n\nIsrael strikes back, kills Hamas commanders\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, who is battling political rivals following his party\u2019s inability to win majority seats to form a government may need victory over Hamas to cement his place as the country\u2019s leader, following the March 2021 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe promised to strike back and has done so. Israeli airstrikes has killed at least 67 people in Gaza, including more than a dozen children, according to the latest updates from Gaza ministry of health. Some of those killed are Hamas commanders.\n\nIsrael said Hamas has fired about 1,500 rockets. Israel is reported to have fired some hundreds. The violence continues. As of 3am Nigerian time on Thursday, both states were still trading rockets.\n\nThe World watches: UN, Russia Vs Arab League\n\nFollowing the crisis, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) called an emergency meeting on Monday. But made no comments about the attacks.\n\nThe Arab League of nation condemned Israel\u2019s attack on Gaza, calling on the UN to \u201cimmediately stop the Israeli aggression and provide the necessary protection for the Palestinian people\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, called for de-escalation.\n\nUN to Hamas: \u201cHamas and other militants\u2019 indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars from highly populated civilian neighbourhoods towards civilian population centres violates international humanitarian law, and it is unacceptable and has to stop immediately.\u201d\n\nUN to Israel: Israeli authorities must \u201cabide by their responsibilities under international law and that Israeli security forces should exercise maximum restraint, calibrate their use of force to spare civilians and civilian objects in the conduct of military operations.\u201d\n\nThe US President Joe Biden finally joined the conversation on Wednesday by saying Israel has the right to defend itself. He made no mention of the Palestinians. Israel is a strong ally of the US.\n\nVladimir Putin of Russia also called for de-escalation while his Turkish counterpart said Israel should be taught a strong lesson. Nigeria is yet to react.\n\nWhat role did Nigeria play?\n\nIn 2012, a draft resolution was presented before the UN general assembly to accord Palestine a \u201cNon-Member Observer State\u201d status at the UN. 138 of 188 countries voted in favour of Palestine. One of those countries was Nigeria.\n\nIn 2011, Nigeria also voted in favour of Palestine becoming a full member of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Nigeria and Palestine are also members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). It would seem like Nigeria is a Palestinian ally.\n\nHowever, in 2014, another resolution was presented before the UN security council to end Israeli occupation of some of these holy sites and yield them to Palestine. One of those sites is key in the recent battles between Israel and Palestine.\n\nThe resolution also sought full UN member status for the country, and Palestine needed nine of 15 votes to get a deal to end Israeli occupation of these sites as soon as 2015 or as late as 2017.\n\nPalestine was sure it would get a vote from Nigeria and some other committed allies. But at the nick of time, Nigeria chose to abstain. Palestine got eight votes and was disappointed Nigeria did not come through to make the ninth vote.\n\nThe state therefore could not get the sites back, neither did it gain full UN member status. Netanyahu praised Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria\u2019s president at the time, for his support.\n\nConclusion: No end in sight\n\nWhen does it end? Possibly never going to end. The de-escalation of this current episode may happen soon, but the crisis and land wars between both countries would likely not end in our lifetime.\n\nThe conflict has gone on for decades, and in the 70+ years the UN has been around, the diplomatic union has been incapable of ending the conflict. As long as China, France, Russia, US and UK remain permanent members of the UNSC, nothing is likely to change.\n\nIf Nigeria voted in favour of Palestine in 2014, would the situation have been different today?",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

Whilst career aspirations may differ, there is a shared understanding that more women need to be involved in tech-related sectors, to meet the growing need for constant innovation across the world and addressing the topic of gender inclusiveness.\n\nWomen\u2019s month celebrated globally provides an opportunity to showcase female-focused initiatives to empower and drive growth for women. Amongst the several initiatives launched this year to celebrate International Women\u2019s day, Bolt introduced its Drive4WI Tech (Drive for Women In Tech) initiative to support women in building a career in technology. The initiative is an internship programme for young women who choose to start a career in technology regardless of their existing educational background.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, 9 interns were selected from Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. The goal for Bolt is to equip these interns, with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nThe interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests with three lucky Nigerians \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji, Miracle Nebo and Oluwakorede Oseni selected in the tightly contested programme.\n\nThe journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing talking point of discussion, largely influenced by cultural norms to societal expectations in relation to gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and is fulfilling its commitments to include more women in tech. The internship is a hands-on experience that gives the interns an opportunity to . The company has designed a curriculum to immerse its interns in their various departments and get the chance to work closely with highly skilled industry experts for the period.\n\nTech is key to development in Nigeria and Africa.

          "title": "THE PRICE OF CHANGE IN OSUN AND AREGBESOLA \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRauf Aregbesola is facing double jeopardy in Osun, the people that refused to submit his name for ministerial appointment are the same people renaming his projects he executed as governor in Osun and the same people singing the chorus of debt in Osun State. Rauf Aregbesola has laid foundation for the development of Osun State and that is the reason that people have projects to rename in Osun State today. Aregbesola is facing double jeopardy as those who collected 20 billion naira refund from Federal Government road projects that Aregbesola executed are the same people singing the chorus of debt. Aregbesola has paid the price of change in Osun. Those singing the chorus of debt will not tell you that Osun Sukuk loan for the building of 11 high schools thay want to rename has been paid. There is no chorus of debt with the Osun security architecture, when Rauf Aregbesola purchased Helicopter for Aerial Security Surveillance and presentation of more sophisticated 25 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) to the Nigerian Police Force, a feat that has never been achieved by any government in the 36 states.\n\nThe chorus of debt in Osun State is calculated to smear Aregbesola\u2019s rising profile as former governor and as present minister of interior. Aregbesola has become a target of smear campaign recently because of \u2018his rising profile in Osun that is difficult for anybody to match\u2019. I must rise to expose and denounce the efforts to damage Aregbesola\u2019s reputation by those who never wanted him to be a minister. It was not surprising that the name of Aregbesola was missing from the list of three persons that were nominated to be minister in Osun. Those singing the chorus of debt today are confused about how Rauf Aregbesola was appointed as minister by President Buhari. When Osun State was paid over 20 billion naira refund in 2020 for federal road projects that Rauf Aregbesola executed, there was no chorus of debt.\n\nWhen Osun is renaming schools built by Aregbesola, there is no chorus of debt and when there is policy reversal on policy development carried out by Aregbesola, there is no chorus of debt.\n\nIn November,2020 The Senate approved promissory notes and bond issuances worth N148.1 billion to Bayelsa, Rivers, Cross River, Osun and Ondo State governments as refunds for projects they executed on behalf of the federal government. The approval was a sequel to the adoption of the report of the Senate committee on Local and Foreign Debts Chaired by Clifford Ordia (PDP, Edo Central).\n\nA breakdown of the money shows: Bayelsa State \u2013 38.4, Cross River State \u2013 18.4 billion, Ondo State \u2013 7.8 billion, Osun State \u2013 4,5 billion and River State \u2013 78.9. A promissory note is a debt instrument which one party promises in writing to pay a determinate sum of money to the other, either at a fixed or determinable future time, under specific terms.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in September,2020 written to the National Assembly, seeking its approval for the issuance of the notes to offset inherited local debts \u2013 federal road road projects executed by the states. Not less than 20 states in Nigeria are currently seeking financial refund incurred on behalf of Federal Government for infrastructure project developments, especially federal road repairs in their territories.\n\nIt is wrong to accuse former Governor Aregbesola of borrowing beyond the capacity of Osun Internally Generated Revenue because Aregbesola has raised the Internally Generated Revenue from 200 million naira monthly to 1.6 billion naira monthly in his eight years. The country\u2019s low debt to GDP ratio, compared to many other countries, has provided the platform for recent successive governments in Nigeria to sustain the argument that the government can afford to borrow. Osun debt is within threshold, it means among nations of the world, Osun set targets or limits for itself. That limit is usually domesticated against the gross domestic product. The volume of Osun debt has not exceed 40 percent of its GDP. Having noted that figure; the Debt Management Office (DMO) in Nigeria has set a limit for Nigeria (self-imposed limit) of 25 percent, despite the fact that the acceptable limit is 40 percent. Nigeria sets a lower bar. DMO wants to pull Nigeria back if we hit 25 percent of our GDP. Nigeria has just hit 20 percent. So, in terms of ratio, Osun is doing very well\n\nThose who criticize Aregbesola on debt are playing politics of 2022 election in Osun State. The people of Osun State are overwhelmed and satisfied with the performance and developmental strides of former Governor Aregbesola. The people have rejected the politicalization of Osun State debt that started from the creation of Osun State in 1991. The people have realized that Osun debt has now become a tool for cheap propaganda in the hands of critics in Osun State as we approach 2022 governorship election because Osun State has benefitted from Paris Club refund even when the state was not created when Nigeria took loan from Paris and London Club of creditors.\n\nOsun\u2019s debt is justified and proportional to the rapid infrastructure and economic development which has proved an undeniable answer to those playing politics with the state\u2019s debt profile. After more than eight years of historic growth, former Governor Aregbesola has achieved high growth as part of a broader effort to shift from consumer-driven economy to a manufacturing-based economy. This has prompted concerns from critics who think that the acceleration is too sharp. Osun\u2019s economic growth for eight years is the highest since 1991\n\nOsun State Government in 2018 has asked the Federal Government to pay it the sum of N19.4 Billion spent on behalf of the Central government to rehabilitate Federal roads in the state.\n\nThe State former Commissioner for Works and Transport, Engineer Kazeem Salami made the appeal in Osogbo on Wednesday during the inspection of Federal road projects being executed in the state by the Minister of state for Power, Works and Housing, Surveyor.\n\nSulaimon Hassan as part of his tour of Federal road projects in the South-West as Commended Osun State Government on Road Projects.\n\nEngr Salami, appreciated former Governor Rauf Aregbesola, for laying solid foundation that has never happened since the inception of the state.\n\nHe therefore appealed to the Federal government to expedite action on reimbursement of N19.4 Billion spent on the road projects by the state government.\n\nThe Minister commended the state government for paying adequate attention to roads in the state and expressed his satisfaction on the quality of road projects constructed by the State Government.\n\nAccording to him, the on-the-spot assessment by the Federal Government is very germane adding that he was really impressed with what he met on ground and promised the reimbursement of the money spent on the roads by the State Government .\n\nResponding, the former Commissioner for Works and Transport in the state, Engr.Kazeem Salami, appreciated former Governor Rauf Aregbesola, for laying solid foundation that has never happened since the inception of the state.\n\nIt would be recalled that this is the third visitation by the Federal Government representative to the State to inspect the road projects.\n\nIn attendance at the project sites were, Permanent Secretary, ministry of Works and Transport, Engr.Nurudeen Adeagbo, management of the ministry, Federal comptroller, ministry of works in Osun, Engr.

          "title": "Southern senators, Reps back govs\u2019 demands, others \u2014",
          "text": "Tunde Opalana and Igho Akeregha, Abuja\n\nSouthern Senators Forum (SSF) has fully endorsed all resolutions on burning national issues taken by their governors at a meeting in Asaba, Delta State on Tuesday.\n\nThe lawmakers aligned with the state executive\u2019s position on call for convocation of a national conference, establishment of state police and banning open grazing of cattle.\n\nThis is also as members of the House of Representatives from the 17 Southern states of the federation have thrown their weight behind Governors of the region who took a position to ban open grazing of cattle while insisting on restructuring and equal treatment for all Nigerians.\n\nThe senators submitted that banning of open grazing would help in reining in those hiding under cattle grazing to unleash terror of kidnapping and killing on the residents of the region.\n\nSouthern Governors Forum (SGF), had at its meeting held in Asaba, Delta State capital, on Tuesday, unanimously passed a verdict prohibiting open grazing in the region to checkmate herders-farmers clashes and senseless kidnapping as well as killings of Nigerian citizens of southern extraction.\n\nA statement jointly signed by the SSF Chairman, Secretary General and Publicity Secretary, Senators Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti), Mathew Uroghide (Edo) and Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu), respectively and made available to journalists in Abuja and Ado Ekiti, on Wednesday, appaluded the step taken by the Governors, saying it would serve as a buffer to wanton destruction of farmlands, kidnappings and carnages .\n\nThe senators lamented how the southern farmers were losing hundreds of millions of naira to plundering of food crops through encroachments on farmlands and exposing the region to famine and acute food scarcity.\n\nThey said: \u201cAt this critical point of our national life when the economy was being bedeviled by galloping inflation, youth unemployment and insecurity, food security is very crucial to mitigate the effects of these diverse evils on the citizens.\n\n\u201cAvailable records have shown that attaining food security status would remain a mirage in the south owing to ravaging effect of outdated livestock grazing policy being unleashed on farmlands by some unscrupulous herders.\n\n\u201cMost appalling were the seemingly unabated kidnapping, raping and killing of our people by suspected herdsmen, who have become bandits heating up the system.\n\n\u201cWith this uniform resolve by our Governors to initiate no-open grazing policy, the region will return to its peaceful and agriculturally self -sufficient status it had assumed even long before Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914.\u201d\n\nThey saluted the governors for ruminating on the expediency and the need for speedy restructuring of the highly lopsided Nigerian nation, saying this will also help to remove the venom that had permeated the land on account of alleged neglect of certain sections of the country.\n\nThe SSF stated that ushering of equality, equity and justice in the way the country is being run will wipe out ethnic tension, restore peace and stability and ward off agitations for secession that are now gaining tractions across the land.\n\nFinally, the Southern Senators Forum encouraged the governors to swiftly follow up on their resolutions by immediately approaching the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to working with the two arms of the parliament to ensure that their well articulated positions on the state of the nation, especially as relate to restructuring, state policing and the jettisoning of archaic traditional grazing methods, which fall short of global best practice standard and a potential threat to our national cohesion and peace, are thoroughly and decisively addressed through the ongoing constitutional review exercise.\n\nAlso backing the position of Governors of the region 22 members of the House of Representatives from Southern Nigeria who issued a statement on Wednesday in Abuja on behalf of their colleagues said after due considerations, they unanimously support the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum on the demand for true federalism, restructuring as well as the worsening insecurity in the country, among others.\n\nThey said this position is in firm restatement of their insistence that the country must exist and be governed on the platform of democratic tenets of social justice, equity, fairness, mutual respect, true federalism, rule of law and constitutional order.\n\nThey maintained their preparedness to deploy all legislative instruments at its disposal for the actualization of the demands.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the House of Representatives members including Honourables Ndudi Elumelu, Peter Akpatason, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, Toby Okechukwu, Adesegun Mujid Adekoya, Dolapo Badaru, Jimoh Ojugbele, Femi Fakeye, Segun Odebunmi, Mayowa Akinfolarin and Olufemi Bamisile on behalf of other lawmakers from the South, expressed firm support for the governors on the immediate ban on open cattle grazing across the Southern region of Nigeria.\n\nWe hold that such is a sure step towards checking the infiltration of bandits, armed herders and terrorist elements which has heightened security challenges with escalated killings and bloody attacks on innocent citizens, while crippling social life, economic activities and food production in the region.\n\nWe therefore support the recommendation that the Federal Government should provide alternative and modern livestock management that does not constitute a security and economic challenge to the nation.\n\nThe platform of Southern members in the House of Representatives said they also support their governors\u2019 restatement of the demand for true federalism through restructuring that will lead to the devolution of power, creation of state police, review of resource control and revenue allocation formula, as well as strict adherence to federal character principle in federal appointments in the shared interests of the federating states.\n\nThe statement added that \u201cAs lawmakers, we affirm that such is the only guaranteed way to ensure fairness, justice, equity to engender national stability, productivity and peaceful co-existence and we support an urgent national dialogue in that regard\u201d.\n\nThey cautioned individuals kicking against the call for devolution of power and review of revenue control and allocation formula, to desist from their vested parochial interest and note that such reviews are the only way to stabilize the country and engender regional or state productivity and heathy development at all levels.\n\nThe lawmakers commended the governors for their concern for the asphyxiation of economic activities in Southern Nigeria resulting from the continued congestion in ports in Lagos and the gridlock on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway.\n\nThis challenge has led to losses in billions of naira to businesses and other economic activities in the industrial and commercial activities of not only in the Southern Nigeria but the nation at large.\n\nWe therefore firmly back the demand for the establishment and activation of other ports in other states of the federation, particularly in the south where such services are in very high demand.\n\nAs lawmakers, our platform assures of our readiness to deploy our legislative instruments to ensure speedy achievement of the reforms and constitutional amendments that will guarantee a restructuring towards the practice of true federalism in our country and we are rallying our colleagues from other parts of the country in this direction.\n\nThe statement urged all Nigerians to see the larger picture and ensure that all hands are on the deck to move the country in the right direction.\n\nThe Southern lawmakers applauded Governors of the region for their patriotism and courage while commending Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State for hosting his colleagues in their quest for solutions at this critical time in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nOther lawmakers from the South who endorsed the statement are Honourables Oluwole OKE, Victor Nwaokolo, Kingsley China, Essien Ekpeyong Ayi and Fred Agbedi.\n\nOthers are Francis Charles, Patrick Asadu, Lynda Ikpeazu, Sylvester Ogbaga, Nkem Abonta and Jerry Alagboso.",

This is the 32-year-old\u2019s first time in the No. 1 slot \u2014 and it isn\u2019t just because of his fighting earnings.\n\nInside the Octagon, he made $22 million \u2014 and it was from a fight he lost, to Dustin Poirier at UFC 257 in January.

We did a spectacular job today from beginning to end, at 2-0 we took a little step back at the end, but we made a huge effort to win, which is what we had to do beyond the good moments and not so good moments we had.\n\n\u201cThis is about getting the three points, and on Sunday we have another game.\u201d\n\nSociedad had their moments but were denied by six saves from Atletico\u2019s talismanic keeper Jan Oblak while forward Portu hit the post late on.\n\nThey finally got a goal when defender Igor Zubeldia bundled the ball into the net in the 83rd minute, ensuring a nerve-shredding finish for the leaders.\n\nAtletico were hemmed into their own half for most of the remaining minutes but clung on for the victory and know they will lift a first La Liga crown since 2014 if they beat Osasuna and Real Valladolid in their final two fixtures.\n\nAtletico lead the standings on 80 points, four clear of second-placed Barcelona and five ahead of third-placed Real Madrid, who visit Granada on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have two games left, that\u2019s a whole world,\u201d Koke added. \u201cThe league is really tight these last five games, we\u2019ve always said it. Everyone is dropping points, these games are finals for us, we won this one and on Sunday and we have another final we want to win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Atleti, if we weren\u2019t suffering, it wouldn\u2019t be us. Thanks to the fans who came here outside [the stadium] and those who can\u2019t. You need your fans to make that extra effort as we did in the last 10 minutes, we could hear them outside. We\u2019re grateful.\u201d\n\nAtletico had earned a crucial draw away to Barcelona on Saturday but the point felt like little after a spirited, ambitious performance at the Camp Nou and the result handed the advantage in the title race to Real.\n\nYet the champions\u2019 2-2 draw against Sevilla on Sunday meant Atletico\u2019s fate was back in their own hands and from the start they went all out for the win, ceding possession to the Basques but eating up the territory with an aggressive pressing game.\n\nMarcos Llorente missed the first clear chance of the game with a bursting run through the middle but was thwarted by Sociedad keeper Alex Remiro after opting to shoot rather than pass to an unmarked Luis Suarez.\n\nLlorente had a hand in the opening goal, playing a one-two into Carrasco, who slotted between the legs of Remiro.\n\nAtletico are often happy to sit on a one-goal lead but did no such thing after going ahead and struck again when Suarez barged his way towards the area and released Correa, who slotted into the bottom far corner.\n\nThey conceded their fair share of chances but were able to count on the ever-reliable Oblak and looked to be in control until Zubeldia\u2019s late goal caused a nervous finale.\n\nYet they defended resolutely in the final minutes and Simeone punched the air as he raced down the tunnel at full-time.",

          "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions kept alive his side\u2019s hopes of a top-four Serie A finish after a 3-1 away win against an impressive Sassuolo on Wednesday.\n\nThe result was not easy to come by for Juve, with returning goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon saving an early penalty, but goals from Adrien Rabiot, Ronaldo and Paulo Dybala meant they stayed fifth, two points off the Champions League qualification places.\n\nBuffon, who announced this week that he is leaving the club at the end of the season, replaced Wojciech Szczesny in goal and immediately showed he has lost none of his ability as he brilliantly kept out Domenico Berardi\u2019s spot kick.\n\nThe chances kept coming and going for the home side, and their profligacy proved costly as Rabiot drilled home the opener in the 28th minute, before Ronaldo reached another goal landmark just before the break.\n\nSassuolo continued to do everything but score, until Giacomo Raspadori did finally beat Buffon just before the hour mark.\n\nBut Dybala also reached a century of Juve goals, with a fine finish six minutes later to ensure they kept pace with their top-four rivals Atalanta, AC Milan and Napoli, who all won in the latest round of matches, with two games to play.\n\nBut for Juve, with the pressure mounting on coach Andrea Pirlo after a meek surrender in a 3-0 loss to Milan at the weekend, it was imperative they did not drop more points.\n\n\u201cIt was important to win tonight, we were so poor in the match with Milan,\u201d Rabiot told DAZN. \u201cWe wanted to do more, we suffered but the attitude was the right one.\n\n\u201cWe are all angry, Juve must do better. We must try to win the last two games and see what happens.\u201d",
