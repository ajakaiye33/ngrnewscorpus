          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026We\u2019ll ensure she gets justice, Delta Govt\n\n\u2026as suspected rapists go into hiding\n\nBy Festus Ahon\n\nA 14-year-old girl who was allegedly gang-raped by seven suspected cultists at Ogboli village in Issele-Uku, Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State has narrated her ordeal in the hands of her rapists.\n\nThe girl (names withheld) who went through one week of intensive medical examination and treatment at a government hospital in Asaba, told members of the State Child\u2019s Rights Implementation Committee and Sexual Offences Unit of the Ministry of Justice how she was beaten and repeatedly raped by one Aboy Nwaise, Sunday, Michael, Abraham, Uche, Jungle Boy and another who were supposed to be her big brothers living in the same neighbourhood.\n\nSpeaking to the government officials after the police had obtained her statement at the hospital, she alleged that Aboy\u2019s mother had earlier threatened to deal with her through the son, but she never envisaged it would be by violent rape.\n\nShe said they are tenants in Nwaise\u2019s family compound and usually they run errands for Aboy\u2019s father who usually gives them money in appreciation, adding that, \u201con this fateful day, Aboy\u2019s father, one Mr. Otu Nwaise had returned home from work after it had rained briefly. He noticed that there was water in their house and none of his children was at home to help him clean up. He beckoned on me to help sweep the water out of the house, which I did.\n\n\u201cThen the next day, the man came back from work, called me and gave me N500 for helping him sweep the house the previous day. This was the money the wife saw him giving to me that made her accuse me of sleeping with her husband.\n\n\u201cMy mother and I including the woman\u2019s husband were surprised because we have always lived as family and the man had always given money to us the children when we run errands for him.\n\n\u201cThe next thing she slapped me twice and snatched the money from my hand. Even when my mother was begging her, she didn\u2019t listen, instead, she was threatening to further deal with me.\n\n\u201cThen a day after, I was returning home from my auntie\u2019s shop where I went to pick my younger brother around 7pm, when the said Aboy accosted me and started interrogating me about what transpired the previous day between me and his mother.\n\n\u201cWhile I was trying to explain, Aboy told me to take my brother home and come back so we could resolve the issue sitting, instead of standing. So I obliged.\n\n\u201cOn returning, Aboy asked that we go to his friend\u2019s house nearby to sort things out, and I followed him, trusting him as a big brother. On getting to the house there were two other boys in there, smoking. And I pleaded with Aboy to quickly talk to me so I could leave because I was allergic to smoke. But he asked me to hold on a little.\n\n\u201cThen again, four other boys came into the room and the next thing Aboy did was to lock the door and put the music that was playing on the highest volume. He then asked me to pull my cloth. At this point, I started pleading with him to allow me go, but instead, he slapped me and hit my head on the wall and forced me naked. That was when all the boys in the room started taking turns in raping me while the music was very loud that nobody could hear me screaming for help.\n\n\u201cThere was a friend of theirs who they didn\u2019t allow in because he was telling them that what they were doing was wrong. It was this their friend that helped me home after they were done raping me and opened the door for me to go with a threat to kill me if I ever mentioned them\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in the same, a source who does not want her name in print, said the sight was horrible when the mother saw her in a pool of blood. She had raised an alarm that attracted neighbours who assisted her to rush the daughter to the hospital around 12am. From there they were referred to the Central Hospital in Asaba, but they had to report at the Divisional Police Station in Issele-Uku, where the DPO had to deploy a patrol team to accompany them to Asaba around 3am that day\u201d.\n\nThe source who spoke further, said case had since been transferred to the State Police Command, adding that the police were on the trail of the alleged rapists, including Aboy\u2019s mother who also is on the run.\n\nAboy\u2019s father, Mr. Nwaise Otu on his part, said he was assisting the police to track his son for an arrest, condemning the actions of his wife and son. He lamented that they had been a thorn on his flesh, praying that his son is caught and made to face the law for his crime.\n\nDisclosing that he had earlier reported his son to the Anti Cult outfit to arrest him and deal with him for being a cultist, he said the boy had severally threatened his life, calling him \u2018a ju man\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Peter Mrakpor has assured that the state would get justice for the victim, saying that would ensure she gets proper medical attention, rehabilitated and relocate her from that environment.\n\nIn the same vein, a member of the State Child\u2019s Rights Implementation Committee, Comrade Patrick Ochei who was detailed to follow up with the case, commended the Attorney General for responding to the situation through the Sexual Offences Unit of the Justice Ministry.\n\nOchei said \u201cthe victim being a child will definitely get justice. The Committee is poised to do everything within its powers and capacities to prosecute the case to logical conclusion. The Committee will come up with programme on how the girl would be rehabilitated. This is the time to show her all the love she deserves including assigning a professional counsellor to aid her emotional healing\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Mike Ozekhome, has faulted the call by 17 southern governors for a constitutional conference to resolve issues in Nigeria, saying it is unnecessary.\n\nOzekhome said this in Awka, the Anambra State capital, as a keynote speaker at the 25th Law Week of the Awka branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA).\n\nSpeaking on the topic: \u2018Legal profession in a lawless society\u2019, Ozekhome said the call for a new conference is unnecessary, especially considering that the recommendation of the one held in 2014 has not been implemented.\n\nHe said, \u201cI was at the 2014 national conference headed by late Justice Idris Kutigi, and the over 200 recommendation we made at that conference is yet to be touched.\n\n\u201cThe conference, which consisted of 492 Nigerians drawn from all strata, has never been touched by this government, even with a 10 foot pole. So, when I heard the 17 southern governors talking about another conference\u2026 I know they mean well for the country, but we do not need another dialogue.\n\n\u201cLet them go to the 2014 recommendations, they will see that we recommended state police, we recommended part-time legislature. The Constitution made the sitting of member of the National Assembly six months, but they are receiving fat salaries.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing with 306 House of Representatives members? What are we doing with 99 senators, what are we doing with them? Why not make it a unicameral legislature or part-time, so that those who are genuinely interested can come and serve the nation, sit and go. We can\u2019t grow like this,\u201d Ozekhome said.\n\nEarlier, the chairman of the NBA, Awka branch, Barr. Ekene Okonkwo, in his opening address, stated that the branch settled for the theme, \u2018Legal profession in a lawless society\u2019, because of the current state of the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme is ocassioned by the lawlessness in the society recently and the killing of security operatives, which has assumed unenviable and frightening dimension.\n\n\u201cWe all know of the unfortunate happening in Nigeria and no one can boldly beat his chest and say he is a Nigerian any longer. Through this event, we are proffering suggestions to the solution of the current state of Nigeria,\u201d he stated.",

          "title": "Eket: Akwa Ibom town struggles in poverty amid affluence, Mobil, Udom Emmanuel indicted",
          "text": "The journey from the Obong Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo was filled with great expectation, as stories about Eket, a town about 45 minutes drive from the Akwa Ibom State capital painted the picture of a sprawling oil city.\n\nOur correspondent\u2019s co-traveller, a famous Nollywood veteran actor was about getting disappointed when he discovered that the destination was actually not Uyo, which he was initially made to believe. But our reporter was, however, quick to assure him that they were actually heading to an oil city, reminding him that it was the same town where Dare Adeboye, Pastor Enoch Adeboye\u2019s son, died two days earlier.\n\nThe high expectations couldn\u2019t have been faulted, as Eket plays host to Mobil Unlimited, one of the major oil multinationals prospecting crude oil in the country. So it was naturally expected that the town, a local government headquarters, will be swimming in \u2018oil money\u2019.\n\nThe great expectation, however, gave way to despair, as they gradually entered the town and caught the first glimpse of where they would be domiciled for the next one week.\n\nLiving short of its fame\n\nFor any first time traveller to that part of Akwa Ibom State, one of the most assured feelings will certainly be that of disappointment, as the reality with Eket and its people paints totally a different picture of the fame and expectation of splendour and plenty many Nigerians have from afar.\n\nAside the beautiful edifices scattered around the town and owned mostly by politicians and government appointees, not much gives out Eket as oil producing community, a sad reminder of the situation in most Niger Delta oil producing communities.\n\nThe town still paints the picture and stubbornly retains all the trappings of a rural community that only has the opportunity of hosting an oil company and by extension, Nigerians from other parts and expatriates who work from their community. This has, however, failed to impact on the community in terms of infrastructure and human development, neither has it impacted on the economy of the town.\n\nLiving in squalor amid plenty\n\nOkon Edet, alias Hunter, is a retired fisherman, who claims to have travelled to different West African countries on fishing expeditions, including other riverine areas of Nigeria. Though he is in his early 40s, he cuts the picture of a man in his late sixties.\n\nHunter, as he is fondly known, struck a cord with this reporter, as he found a listening ear, as he fondly talked about his many fishing trips and life after retirement as a fisherman.\n\nThis reporter\u2019s path crossed his as the scorching Eket sun on Thursday, forced him to sit in what looked like nearest to nature, a place Hunter gleefully introduced as his compound. Sitting on the more than a plot of land, is a \u2018bungalow\u2019 made with planks and asbestos and rustic iron sheets. Hunter\u2019s bungalow, a one room shanty, without toilet and kitchen facilities, is adorned all around by what looks more like a plantain plantation, where he also has other food plants.\n\nCuriously, Hunter\u2019s abode, where he lives with his five children, all under 12 years of age, sits directly opposite one of the biggest and most beautiful houses in Eket, belonging to a former governorship candidate in the state, painting a contradictory picture. The same magnificent edifice Hunter claimed to have provided security for while it was being built.\n\nFor Hunter, life in Eket is totally different from what people think it is from outside, as nothing is happening, especially for the indigenes, who mostly are out of work and only managing to survive on a daily basis. This, he demonstrated when this reporter called for a drink for himself and his new found friend. It was, however, shocking when he returned with just one bottle as against two. Asked why he didn\u2019t buy his own, he said his children queried him if they will not eat when he told them to buy two bottles. So he chose to buy one and use his to look for what they will eat.\n\n\u201cMy brother, you don\u2019t know what you have done for me and the children this afternoon. It\u2019s like God sent you to us\u201d, he said thankfully after this reporter called one of the children and handed her the money to cook.\n\nSpeaking further, Hunter said it is only the politicians, the big men and Mobil workers that can boast of living a good life in Eket.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is high and I get to meet people every time who come from outside the state but most times they are disappointed. People actually believe things are rosy here but at least, you can see for yourself. Apart from politicians and oil workers, who are not from here, nobody has anything to show for the status of Eket, as a host to Mobil,\u201d he said.\n\nMobil and its COVID-19 excuse\n\nResidents of Eket, in chats with DAILY POST revealed that most of the indigenes of the town who were working with Mobil have been home since 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the order of the company. They, however, said other workers from outside Eket, mostly Yoruba, who they said formed the bulk of the work force, have continued working.\n\nRex, is a local politician, with a small chops business as a side hustle, something he said he survives with at the moment. According to him, Mobil has compounded the poverty level in the town after dislodging indigenes from the services of the company hiding under COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 came, indigenes who were working with Mobil were asked to stay at home and they have remained at home without salaries or any compensation after unjustly and cleverly laying them. And to our surprise, every morning, you see long convoy of escorted coaster buses carrying Yoruba people to work. If our people cannot work, why allow others. Or are the Yoruba still working in the company immune from COVID-19?\n\n\u201cWe have tried to make representations to the company but they seem not to be interested in dealing with our complaints and that has been their style over the years. They are taking our peaceful nature for granted and when pushed to the wall, we know what to do\u201d, Rex said.\n\nAlso commenting on the treatment by Mobil, a former staff of the company, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, Akpan, said youths of the town are already becoming restless and unless something is done urgently by the company to address the issues on ground, its continued unhindered operation may not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cMobile has been toying the familiar line of most oil companies operating in the Niger Delta, refusing to give employment to indigenes of oil producing communities. In the case of Eket, the little jobs, which were mostly low cadre ones that we had have been taken away from us, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse.\n\n\u201cWe were not told we have been sacked but that is what it has turned to because we are not being paid but the Yoruba people and others continue to go to work and have been collecting their fat salaries. It is unfortunate that the company is treating us with contempt just because they believe that we are helpless. When it is time, they will know we are not helpless, as their military escorts will not be strong enough to withstand the popular revolt of the people.\n\nUdom Emmanuel Indicted\n\nSeveral residents of Eket are also quick to score Governor Udom Emmanuel low in performance in office so far, insisting that he has neglected the area since he came into office.\n\nAccording to many of them, whatever can be seen in Eket and its environs as traces of development were done by the administrations of Obong Victor Attah and Godswill Akpabio, noting that Governor Emmanuel has neglected them.\n\nOkon, a commercial motorcycle operator in Eket, while chatting with this reporter, said he and most of his colleagues chose to take to commercial motorcycle business because they have nothing else to do and that the state government has not done anything to empower citizens.\n\n\u201cYou can see a large number of \u2018Okada\u2019 riders in town, both the very young and fairly old. Many of us took to this business because of lack of what to do. No job and the state government has done nothing to help empower us to do other things that are more dignifying. I have my National Diploma, but I ended up doing this.\n\n\u201cEven if you can\u2019t get me a job, empower me to be self-employed, make our roads motorable, make life more meaningful. The problem is so much that an average young girl in Eket, from the age of 18 is a potential prostitute. Many of them took to what they call hustling just to survive. You will be shocked that some of them are actually living with their parents and most times, they contribute to what goes on at home from their hustling. It is really a sad situation. We have the name and the fame, but sadly, it does not reflect on our daily lives. That fame is not real,\u201d Okon declared.",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele and Sanni Onogu, Abuja\n\nFederal officials on Thursday chided South\u2019s governors for Tuesday\u2019s Asaba declaration.\n\nThe governors\u2019 call for the convocation of an \u201curgent national dialogue\u201d, \u201cbold steps to restructure the country\u201d, \u201ctotal ban on open grazing\u201d and for President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto address the nation\u201d, was faulted by Senate President Ahmad Lawan and House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThis is contrary to the backing the call got on Wednesday from senators from the South and members of the House of Representatives from the South.\n\nLawan accused the governors of retreating to regionalism to address a national issue that should be collectively decided upon.\n\nGbajabiamila, in the same vein, said to end the security challenge, all must \u2018imbibe the spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity and love.\u201d\n\nFormer Nasarawa State Governor Abdulahi Adamu, a senator representing Nasarawa West, accused the governors of \u201cbetraying the trust.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut a former Oyo State Governor Rashidi Ladoja, Igbo youths and Minority party members of the House of Representatives from the North gave their backing to the governors\u2019 call.\n\nLawan and Gbajabiamila spoke at the Presidential Villa in Abuja after the prayer along with President Buhari. Senator Adamu spoke in Keffi, Nasarawa State, also after observing the prayers.\n\nLawan said: \u201cI believe that, as leaders, especially those of us who are elected, should not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing because, even if you are a governor, you are supposed to be working hard in your state to ensure that this restructuring you are calling for at the federal level, you have done it in your state as well.\n\n\u201cWhat you may accuse the Federal Government of, whatever it is, you may also be accused of the same thing in your state. So, we are supposed to ensure that we have a complete and total way of ensuring that our systems at the federal, state and even local government levels work for the people.\n\nRead Also: Ladoja backs southern governors on open grazing\n\n\u201cWe should avoid regionalism. We are all leaders and we are in this together. The solutions to our challenges must come from us regardless of what level of government we are, whether at the federal, state or the local government level. I believe that Nigeria is going to come out of these challenges stronger\u201d.\n\nLawan added: \u201cI also want to take this opportunity to say that we have diminished the local government system. I think we can attribute the security issues to the absence of a functional local government system.\n\n\u201cI think the time has come for us to take up the challenge and ensure that the local government system functions. This is as we look for ways to curb the security challenge. We must never neglect the local government system. We must go back to our local government system to ensure they are autonomous and functional\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila said: \u201cIf truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame for what is happening today.\n\n\u201cWhatever challenges we have, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve these issues we\u2019re facing. We must imbibe that spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity and love that would take us through this.\u201d\n\nSenator Adamu slammed the governors, saying: \u201cThe recent meeting of the Southern Governors Forum is an act of betrayal of trust. Each governor swore to an oath and they emphasised loyalty to the sovereignty of this country. They pledged their loyalty to the President of the country. That\u2019s their oath of office.\n\n\u201cWhile we accept the fact that we have various forms of association and freedom of expression as citizens, they have failed to express their views through the right channel.\n\n\u201cThey are members of the Council of State. There is no better forum at their level to take a joint decision than such forum. The fact that they have taken a decision as a divisive move, does not speak well of their intention.\n\n\u201cI think they are just playing to the gallery. What they are saying is not new. They are like broken record, saying the same thing over and over again.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t they come to the appropriate body which is the National Assembly to project their ideas?\n\n\u201cThey have members in the National Assembly who are representing them. If they have an issue that is so important as that, which borders on the Constitution of the country, they should go there and express their grievances.\n\n\u201cWe would sit, debate it and see how best we can come out of it. There can\u2019t be Nigeria if every one wants to have things happen in his or her own way.\n\n\u201cThere is a Constitution and there is a framework that we are supposed to operate as governors. To go outside it is a betrayal of their oath of office.\n\n\u201cEach of them talking there, if you take a look at what is happening in their individual states, they cannot in all honesty and good conscience, challenge Buhari.\n\n\u201cJust take them one by one and see what they are doing in their states and what the people who voted for them are undergoing.\n\n\u201cIs it Buhari that caused it? Did Buhari withhold their federation account allocation? Did Buhari collect their internal revenue? It is just enough of this nonsense.\n\n\u201cAnybody who wants restructuring should bring his proposal to the National Assembly as a private member bill.\n\n\u201cThey have members who would bring it up. I wonder why educated people, some of whom are lawyers, would just want to make noise to divert attention.\n\n\u201cOur eyes are on the ball and they would remain on the ball. They can go on talking, Nigeria will remain a united country.\u201d\n\nOn agitations by some groups to secede from Nigeria, Adamu said those clamouring for, would fail.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed in those subversive elements calling for separation from Nigeria at a time when everybody should bow before their creator and pray for peace to reign in our land.\n\n\u201cThose clamouring for separation and secession in this country will fail by the grace of God because they do know as a matter of reality that their peace and prosperity is dependent on the stability and continued existence of Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t succeed as smaller nations. We have to find a way of understanding ourselves as citizens so that we can work together.\u201d\n\nLagos lawyer Mike Ozekhome said the call for a national dialogue by the Southern governors was unnecessary.\n\nHe argued that the recommendations of the last National Conference had not been implemented.\n\nDelivering a paper as a keynote speaker at the 25th Law week of the Awka branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ozekhome argued that another national conference would amount to a waste of time and resources.\n\nThe rights activist, who spoke on \u201cLegal profession in a lawless society\u201d, said if the southern governors wanted to get it right, they should have referred to the 2014 recommendations which he was part of.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was at the 2014 National Conference headed by the late Justice Idris Kutigi, and the over 200 recommendations we made at that conference were yet to be touched.\n\n\u201cSo, when I heard the 17 southern governors talking about another conference\u2026 I know they mean well for the country, but we do not need another dialogue.\n\n\u201cLet them go to the 2014 recommendations, they will see that we recommended state police, we recommended part-time legislature.\u201d\n\nAlso, VON DG Okechukwu advised Nigerians not to see the socio-economic and security challenges facing the country as a reason to give more powers to state governors who are already mismanaging their powers.\n\nHe warned that conceding more powers to the governors, whom he described as \u201cemperors\u201d would put the country\u2019s democracy in grave danger.\n\n\u201cIt will be paradoxical for us to expect good governance at the sub-national level when the governors have locked up democratic institutions,\u201d Okechukwu said in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe VON boss, who is also a founding member of All Progressives Congress (APC) called on Nigerians to look beyond the frenzy of restructuring as canvassed by the Southern governors.\n\nHe argued that giving more powers to governors will by omission or commission create Frankenstein monsters which will put our democracy in harm\u2019s way.",

          "text": "By Chikodi Okereocha\n\nThe Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Federal Government, the National Assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to halt the electoral flaws, systemic weaknesses and structural defects in the nation\u2019s electoral processes.\n\nIts Lagos State Chairman, Deji Doherty, spoke at a town hall meeting, following the call by well-meaning Nigerians to the president to assent the 2020 Electoral Amendment Bill. He said the bill would engender a \u201cgenerally acceptable free and fair elections\u201d.\n\nDoherty said many people have been victims of these anomalies in the electoral system.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many electoral flaws, systemic\\weaknesses, structural defects and loopholes in our electoral system, which have caused more damage during and after elections. But, we must engage the Federal Government, National Assembly and INEC to do the right things now.\n\n\u201cAny system or structure that favours a microcosm of people against the well-being and welfare of the masses must not be acceptable and a new pro-people structure, system, laws and policies should be instituted.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDoherty said the worst mistake people could make was to choose the wrong persons to occupy the seats of power and decide their fate. He noted that prior to 2015, Nigerians were not gnashing their teeth thus bad, but now, the level of poverty in the land has reached a crescendo.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is good for people to make choices, then compare and contrast and make wiser decisions as it\u2019s obvious today in the country. Nigerians have tested the PDP regime and this administration, now they can say without mincing words the difference between light and darkness.\u201d\n\nThe party chairman said the future of young people is not only bleak, but hopeless, given the glaring hostile socio-economic environment where businesses and corporate organisations are regrettably winding down.\n\nThe chairman urged the Federal Government, the National Assembly and the INEC to fix every loophole in the electoral system to avoid a damage to democracy.\n\nHe decried the level of socio-economic unrest in the country and the influx of young people into Lagos State, adding: \u201cOur Northern governors must fix their region and make it habitable for people to live comfortably and do their businesses. Lagos is getting too much populated, making life miserable, especially the traffic congestion and other structural defects.\n\nDoherty added: \u201cWe are coming to give a better life to Lagosians and Nigeria at large as we are sure Nigerians would not make another terrible mistake in the coming elections. This time, PDP is coming with healing balm and we shall fix the power, health, education, social infrastructure and other critical sectors of the economy. Nigerians shall see better days again.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned party members against detractors as 2023 beckons, urging women in the party to get ready to maximise opportunities for elective positions at any level of governance.\n\nDoherty said: \u201cOur members must beware of hawks from other parties and resist any form of inducement and facade emanating from deceivers. I believe Nigerians would not be cowed again by duplicitous rhetorics from lairs. Nevertheless, Nigerians must see better days again, but the asses must not retreat from doing their bids wisely this time.\u201d",

Shina Abiola Peller is not your regular lawmaker.\n\nDuring his campaigning for his current office, where he represents Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa federal constituency in Oyo State at the House of Representatives, he went with the mantle of making a difference and bringing a change to the political atmosphere in Nigeria while fostering the inclusion of youth in politics.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, blamed the delay in supply of military hardware by manufactures for the handicap the administration is facing in fighting Boko Haram, bandits and other violent crimes in the country.\n\nHe stated this shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast at Aso Villa, Abuja, yesterday, while calling for understanding by Nigerians.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said: \u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order for weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers to ship them, and when brought here, eventually, they are taken to training institutions, where we train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process. I expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at time and available resources.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we came in, in the North East, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest, and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nHe, however, vowed to use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits, to ensure that they do not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming farming season.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement coming after nearly six years in power is, however, seen by many as contradicting his 2015 election promise of ridding the country of all forms of terrorism and insurgency within the shortest possible time. Under his reign, violent crimes have been on the increase, spreading from the North East to North West and, lately, South east and South South where Fulani herdsmen and bandits have invaded communities, farmlands and schools, killing and kidnapping hundreds for ransom.\n\nThe president, while expressing the hope for a good rainy season this year, said \u201cthe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land, so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today, both on security and the economy, and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for its support, saying emphatically that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has thanked God for enabling them witness the end of Ramadan.\n\nShe appealed to Nigerian women to take responsibility of their children by guarding and protecting them against abuse and other vices.\n\n\u2022Young farmers urge emergency plan to forestall food crisis\n\nThe Nigeria Young Farmers Network has said an emergency national food security plan, that would actively engage the private sector, is critical to forestall the nation\u2019s imminent food crisis.\n\nThe Director General (DG) of the network, Mr Promise Amahah, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAmahah spoke against the backdrop of the relentless increase in prices of food and agricultural produce in Nigerian markets, which he warned might lead to a national food crisis very soon.\n\nHe said that government alone could not achieve reasonable progress in this regard, adding that more intensive action was required to address the challenge.\n\nAmahah said the Federal Government needed to provide the enabling environment for companies and startups providing solutions like storage facilities, logistics, payments, among others.\n\n\u2022Onyewuchi harps on justice, fairness\n\nThe Senator representing Imo East Senatorial District, Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi, has commended the Southern Governors Forum for what he described as their principled and patriotic position on various issues bedeviling Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Chiaka Alozie, the senator insisted that in line with the position of the governors, only justice and fairness can guarantee the unity and progress of the country.\n\nOnyewuchi bemoaned the hardship faced by millions of Nigerians, adding that there is an urgent need to address the rising insecurity, economic downturn and increasing agitations by different ethnic nationalities, for the restructuring of the country.\n\nHe said that Nigerians yearn for a country that works for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic and religious backgrounds, while taking into consideration the sensitivity of the diversity of the country.\n\nHe urged the southern governors to continue to work with other stakeholders to ensure that the dream for a better Nigeria is realised.",

Laying down one\u2019s life for the country is one of the greatest sacrifices any citizen can make to his country.

Why are they saying they would build another refinery in Daura (Katsina State)? And they would be bringing crude oil from Niger Republic to the place.

          "text": "From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi, Obinna Odogwu, Awka, Felix Ikem, Nsukka, Lukman Olabiyi\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday, applauded the decision of the southern governors to ban open grazing, saying any Nigerian opposed to their position has a hidden agenda.\n\nThe governor, who stated this at Holy Ghost Parish Hall, during the \u2018Media Week and Communications Day 2021\u2019 organised by the Directorate of Social Communications, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi, said his colleagues from the southern part of the country had towed the right path towards addressing insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nOrtom, who noted that open grazing is no longer feasible in the country due to development and population growth, said Nigeria is a great country with great potentials and should, ordinarily, have no business with poverty, if only there was guaranteed security for lives and property and the people allowed to remain stable in their localities, to explore opportunities in farming and other ventures.\n\nThe governor thanked the Church and Muslim community, as well as residents and citizens of the state, for remaining supportive of his administration.\n\nHe also commended the good reportage of government policies and programmes by the Directorate of Social Communication, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi and all the media groups in Benue, maintinaing that his administration would always welcome constructive criticism.\n\nA youth body, under the aegis of Save Enugu Youth Initiatives also commended the governors\u2019 recommendation for the restructuring of the country, state policing and the jettisoning of open grazing as panacea for the lingering insecurity across the federation.\n\nThe youth body described as factual, the problems identified by the governors, while urging the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, muster courage and embrace the timely calls by the southern leaders, to save the nation from sliding into a ditch.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun in Nsukka, yesterday, the Convener of the group, Gwiyi Solomon, who was flanked by the state coordinator of the group, Comr. Chibueze Nwoga, commended the southern governors for demonstrating genuine leadership and exemplary representation, especially as it concerns burning national issues.\n\n\u201cWhat the southern governors resolved at Asaba, in Delta State, on Tuesday, is the only way out of the debacle in which we found ourselves in the current Nigerian nation.\n\n\u201cTheir resolutions are far-reaching and shouldn\u2019t be swept under the carpet by the federal government if, indeed, they love and have Nigeria at heart. A resolution to ban open grazing is the way to go; a resolution calling for restructuring and national confab are both timely and necessary now,\u201d Gwiyi concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) and the Agbekoya Farmers Society described the ban of open grazing as a welcome development that would go a long way in checking insecurity across the entire southern Nigeria, but also sought the governors permission on the use of juju to enforce the ban and deal with criminal/ defiant herdsmen ruthlessly.\n\nOPC Publicity Secretary, Yinka Oguntimehin and the National Secretary of Agbekoya, Prince Adegbenro Ogunlana made the pledge at separate interviews with Daily Sun. Oguntimehin said:\u201d It\u2019s a very welcome development, and we believe it would go a long way in checking issues of insecurity. If we get the government\u2019s backing, we will use all we have, including juju, to tackle insecurity.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ogunlana said: \u201cIt\u2019s a good step taken in the right direction by the governors if they are sincere with their decision and not just playing politics, as usual.\n\nNobody is against anybody; all we care for is security of life and property. The South is not against the North. Apart from ban on open grazing and other resolutions of governors, the farmers should also be compensated for their loss in the past; government should support us. If government can back us, our traditional ways of protecting life and security are still with us, and we are ready to unleash it, if permitted by the government.\u201d\n\n\u2022New confab not necessary- Ozekhome\n\nHowever, Constitutional lawyer and rights activist, Mike Ozekhome, yesterday, advised the 17 governors in the Southern Nigeria to perish their call and expectations for another constitutional conference, stressing that they should rather demand the implementation of the 2014 confab.\n\nOzekhome, while speaking on the topic \u201cLegal Profession in a Lawless Society, in Awka, Anambra State capital\u201d, during the 25th Law Week of the Awka branch of the NBA, where he was a keynote speaker, said that the implementation of the recommendations of the 2014 confab convened by former President Goodluck Jonathan, would go a long way in solving the country\u2019s challenges.\n\nOzekhome said: \u201cI was at the 2014 national conference headed by late Justice Idris Kutigi, and the over 200 recommendations we made at that conference are yet to be touched.\n\n\u201cSo, when I heard the 17 southern governors talking about another conference\u2026 I know they mean well for the country; but we do not need another dialogue.\n\n\u201cLet them go to the 2014 recommendations, they will see that we recommended state police and part-time legislature. The Constitution made the sitting of member of the National Assembly six months, but they are receiving fat salaries.\u201d",

This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nCommenting on ongoing efforts by his administration to tackle the security crisis, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying part of the resolutions reached at the meetings had been made public by the National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), and the others kept secret.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nHe commended the National Assembly for its support, saying: \u201cThe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nBuhari appealed to the elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers (to produce them). It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources.\n\nFor example, when we came in, in the North-east, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States, and the South-south, in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment are what is happening in the North-west and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nBuhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; the Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.\n\nBuhari, Aisha Step out Together First Time in Months\n\nFor the first time in months, Buhari yesterday stepped out with his wife, Aisha, to celebrate this year\u2019s Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nBuhari shared many photos on social media where he and his wife were surrounded by their children and their spouses.\n\nIn some of the photos, Buhari was also seen with his grandchildren.\n\nIn a string of tweets, the president congratulated all Muslims on the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid festival and prayed that it will bring with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst others.\n\nHe sought \u201cunity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians,\u201d adding that these virtues are imperative \u201cespecially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Meanwhile, the oil sector dropped by 19.8 per cent y-o-y after a 13.9 per cent y-o-y contraction in 3Q, 2020,\u201d the report for May stated.\n\nIt stated that in 2020, the economy contracted 1.9 per cent y-o-y, following a 2.3 per cent y-o-y expansion in 2019, while inflation was still structurally high in the first quarter of this year, with the annual inflation rate jumping to 18.17 per cent in March 2021, the highest rate since January 2017 amid the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has also weakened the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, a surge in oil output by Russia and Oman in April lowered the compliance rate to the OPEC+ production cuts, with the nine non-OPEC countries that participate in the cuts overproducing by 347,000 barrels per day, equating to a compliance rate of 85 per cent, the lowest level for the 12 months that the pact had been in force.\n\nCompliance among the 10 participating OPEC countries, by contrast, was 123 per cent, thanks largely to the Saudis\u2019 additional voluntary reduction of one million bpd in February-April, which came on top of its official OPEC+ cut of 1.88 million bpd.\n\nThe average compliance rate for the entire OPEC+ group fell to 110 per cent in April from a record high of 113 per cent in March.\n\nThe non-OPEC partners\u2019 poor performance is certain to aggravate the Saudis and other Mideast and African producers, which have hit their targets in recent months which could create a tense atmosphere during future negotiations about opening the taps in the second half of the year.\n\nSaudi Arabia is looking to unwind its voluntary cut of one million bpd in May-July, which will necessitate winning back market share that it ceded in Asia when the voluntary cut was enacted in February.\n\nAlso, oil prices dropped by almost three per cent yesterday and were set for the biggest percentage drop since early April, after the restart of Colonial Pipeline, eased some of the concerns about petrol shortages in the U.S. East.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, West Texas International crude was falling by 2.94 per cent at $64.14 while Brent Crude was down by 2.64 per cent at $67.49.\n\nOil prices snapped the winning streak from earlier this week when reports from both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reiterated the view that global oil demand would rebound strongly in the second half of the year with more economies reopening and increased travel amid higher vaccination rates.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s bullish outlook on demand, coupled with a similar view from OPEC from Tuesday, sent oil prices to an eight-week high on Wednesday, almost hitting $70.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Boko Haram Scare: Law School DG Insensitive, Says NBA Chairman",
          "text": "Eromosele Abiodun and Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikeja Branch, Mr. Bath Aguegbodo, has accused the Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Professor Isa Ciroma (SAN), of being insensitive to the danger students billed to write their examination next week at the Bwari campus of the school would be exposed to due to the scare of bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\nHe said the students should be allowed to write the examinations scheduled to start from Monday at other campuses due to the reported security scare in the Bwari area.\n\nAguegbodo stated this yesterday when he appeared on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a breakfast programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think it would be out of insensitivity on the part of the director-general to continue to insist that the exams would be taken. If you look at the Chibok issue, there was intelligence information to both the security agencies and the management of the school that they were open to attack and they ignored it. I think it is important for everybody to apply pressure on the DG to see reasons.\u201d\n\nThe examination, he stated, must not take place in the Bwari, adding that there are other campuses where security concerns are not as serious as they are in Bwari.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit sad looking at things the way it is panning out; the security of students writing exams in Bwari should be paramount. I have listened to comments credited to the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, and the guarantees are given that security will be provided for students who will write the exams in Bwari.\n\n\u201cBut the question on my mind in the issue is security from where? Just last week, we heard there were attempts in the Villa. The Niger State governor had also said on two occasions that there were some communities in Niger State, which is less than two hours from where the law school is located, that has been taken over by the Boko Haram people,\u201d he said.\n\nAguegbodo added that the argument that JAMB is located at Bwari and some other universities that are located there have not shut down does not hold water.\n\nAccording to him, the psychological state of the students writing the exams must be considered.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat would be the mind of students writing exams when they have fears that they may be kidnapped?\n\n\u201cThe essence of the exams is to assess students as to their preparedness on what they have been taught. I do not see how a fair assessment would be done when a student is writing exams knowing fully well that the bandits are just about two hours away from them.\n\n\u201cThe unsettled mind would definitely reflect in the final result, which would not bring a fair assessment of what the exams are meant to achieve at the end of the day. If they could take their lecture in their various campuses, it would be the necessary thing for the government to look at it, that it is the safety of citizens first before the exams.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Council of Legal Education, attorney-general and the director-general of Nigerian Law school is that the safety of the students must be put into place if the examination is to be a fair assessment of what they have learned.\u201c\n\nHe also canvassed the postponement of the examination by one or two weeks.\n\nSpeaking on who should bear the cost, if the students were to be relocated to other campuses, he said it was the duty of the government to provide a conducive environment for the examinations to hold, adding that if the environment is not conducive, the government would have to bear the cost.\n\nParents of students at the Bwari campus had called on the management of the school to relocate the students to its other campuses owing to reported security scare in the area.\n\nThe worried parents, who insisted that the safety of their wards should be the priority, stated that they did not want to go through the same harrowing experience of parents of the Greenfield University students abducted by bandits in Kaduna recently.\n\nBoko Haram scare has created panic among the residents of the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in recent weeks.\n\nBwari town, an outskirt of Abuja shares a boundary with Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INVESTIGATION: How Rivers State Revenue Officers Divert Millions Of Government Funds Into Private Bank Accounts",
          "text": "In this three-month investigation, this reporter used a pseudonym name, Rose John, poses as a Diploma Student in Ken Polytechnic and paid a total sum of N195,000 to get a tax clearance certificate from two separate staff of Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue offices in Port Harcourt. However, out of the N195,000 paid, only N30,300 went into the coffers of the Rivers State Government. TCC office at the headquarters also collaborates with branch tax officers to cheat the Rivers Government. The reporter had disguised herself to look like the ignorant Nigerian which the tax officers took advantage of.\n\nThe Rivers State Government has several times warned tax officers to stop collecting cash from taxpayers. Rather, they should direct any payment to the Government designated bank, but the tax officers are illegally charging residents and then failing to remit to the government. This, they do in connivance with some bank officials.\n\nBetween August and September 2020, the Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike borrowed over N24billion to accelerate development which included construction of flyover, dualisation of road and compensation to families of demolished buildings among others. Nyesom said the fund will be repaid from the Internally Generated Revenue. What this means is that, with the constant IGR being diverted into an individual account, the Governor might not pay the loan on time. And this will affect development in the state.\n\nInside the Rivers State Secretariat, close to the Podium Block, there is a branch office of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office. Immediately the reporter got close to the entrance of the tax office, she was accosted by a dark female security lady, in blue and black trousers.\n\nThe security officer requested to know the office the reporter was heading to, and when the reporter told her she wanted to get a Tax Clearance Certificate, she was directed to a then pregnant lady called IB, chocolate in complexion.\n\nThe Discussion with IB\n\nThe reporter told IB that she wants to get a tax clearance for herself and her sister who is also a student, and it is part of a requirement to apply for a scholarship abroad. IB told her each TCC will cost N150,000 each, even when the reporter pleads that they want to use it to apply for a scholarship and they are yet to know their fate whether they will be chosen or not.\n\nThe reporter had earlier visited the state revenue branch at Aggrey Road, a fair in complexion officer told her Tax Clearance Certificate for students is free, and all she needed is to submit the school admission letter and payment of school fees receipt.\n\nBut, this is different from what the tax officer(IB) inside the state secretariat told the reporter.\n\n\u201cI will bring the price down to N100,000 each since it's for both\u201d, IB said. The reporter pleaded for the money to be reduced yet it wasn't. IB told the reporter that the amount mentioned, she will still go and discuss with her boss and plead with him to accept the amount.\n\nAfter much argument, the reporter requested IB to give her the state government's bank account number to make payment. IB bluntly told the reporter that she can't pay to the bank because they don't know her, rather she(IB) is the one the reporter needs to pay to the bank. This is contrary to what the Rivers State Government jingles says. The state government has severally said it has no agent representing the government in collection of taxes. The government has warned tax officers not to collect cash rather they should direct the payer to the bank.\n\nIB wanted cash but the reporter intentionally requested her bank account details.Happily, IB, gave the reporter her personal Guaranty Trust bank account details; Diri Ibieri Tonye. IB for short, came from Ibieri, our report understands. The reporter made a transaction of N80,000 on September 17,2020, and to also document cash received, this reporter called IB and informed her that she couldn't make the transfer again if she could bring cash immediately. Same day, the balance of N20,000.00 was given to Ibieri. This was also captured on camera.\n\nTax clearance certificate collected from IB without TIN.\n\nEvery taxpayer is expected to use their Rivers Tax Identification Number to pay their taxes. The reporter was hoping IB would request for RIVTIN but she didn't. Neither did she ask for a document to prove that the reporter\u2019s sister was a student.\n\nAlthough the reporter went with a computerised and edited scanned document as an Admission letter and an edited passport picked from the internet, IB failed to confirm if really the reporter is fake with intention to cheat the government. This act has been perpetrated by several scammers who cheat the government and most times in connivance with the staff of the Rivers Internal Revenue Board\n\nSurprisingly, two days after, IB called this reporter to come pick her tax-clearance certificate that it was ready. Ibieri persuaded the reporter to come to do the second TCC since the previous was ready. The reporter had told IB that once the TCC was ready, she would come to the second TCC for herself.\n\nThe reporter visited IB and she gave the reporter the Tax Clearance Certificate of 3years, starting from 2017, a hundred thousand Naira (N100,000) receipts from Internal Revenue Revenue, and also an stamped Access bank teller to prove to the reporter that she paid the money to the government designated bank as said earlier.\n\nTracking the Stamped Access Bank Teller\n\nThe location of the bank teller states Bank Road. Bank road is close to the state secretariat opposite the Rivers State Judiciary complex.\n\nThe reporter went into the bank to find out the authenticity of the bank teller. The first customer care she met was close to the entrance of the bank, a fair complexioned lady told the reporter, the bank teller is authentic.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see our stamp on it? said the Access bank customer care personnel, without confirming the authenticity of the receipt from the computer.\n\nBut the reporter insisted that she check the system before assuming the bank teller is authentic. The bank official reluctantly told the reporter to move to the extreme of the counter to meet the cashier for confirmation. And this reporter did.\n\n\u201cWhere did you pay this money? The receipt can't be found, said the bank cashier whom the reporter had handed over the bank teller given by the revenue officer, Ibieri. The reporter told her the revenue officer gave her the teller that the money was paid in this branch.\n\nThe reporter insisted the bank cashier should check using the name on the teller, the number and the stamp yet the bank cashier insisted that all had been done yet she could not see any of the names used in payment and the teller number was not recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, Diri Ibieri Tonye used Rose John as given by the reporter to pay the money. What this means is that the N100,000 the reporter paid for Tax Clearance was not paid to the government's bank account; rather, it was paid to the Tax officer of Rivers State Internal revenue board.\n\nThe bank teller and computer printout given to the reporter by IB were also fake, and this can be possible with the help of a bank official.\n\nOn a separate day, the reporter visited the Rumuogba board of Internal Revenue close to Mini-okoro police station. Immediately she entered the reception by the right is an office occupied by two tax officers, a man and a fair woman.\n\nThe reporter moved to the first person, a dark man and told him she wanted to get a tax clearance and he pointed to the other lady, fair in complexion, who identified herself as Legbosi.\n\nLegbosi was attending to a customer, immediately the reporter met her and told her she wanted TCC for herself and her sister, and they are students. This reporter made her aware of the urgency of the TCC to enable her to apply for a scholarship abroad. Immediately, Legbosi brought out a pen, wrote down her telephone contact and told the reporter to go home and call her at 4pm. Earlier, Legbosi had told the reporter to get the school admission letter, ID card and receipt. The reporter, knowing she can't easily get the school ID card, she quickly told Legbosi that she is yet to be given an ID card from the school since 2018.\n\nThis reporter was disguised and looked unkempt when she visited Legbosi's office and pretended to be among the ignorant Nigerians. So, Legbosi, a senior tax officer, decided to take advantage of her looks to cheat her.\n\nIn the evening, this reporter called Legbosi who told her to pay N150,000 after much pleading, the reporter stood her ground on N95,000 and the tax officer, Legbosi agreed. It took over two months before Legbosi agreed for N95,000. This was when the reporter suddenly visited the tax office and told her what they agreed on the phone was N95,000. Legbosi could not remember how much she had told the reporter.\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the reporter visited the tax office, hoping that the state government account would be given to make payment. Legbosi requested cash. The reporter told her to give the state account to make payment but Legbosi said the money was to be paid to her while she would pay to the bank. Just like her colleague Ibiere at the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office inside the state secretariat.\n\nThe reporter requested her bank account and she refused and told the reporter to go across the office and do a withdrawal. Outside the office is the police microfinance bank. The reporter went outside and withdrew the N90,000 and intentionally left N5,000 to be transferred into Legbosi bank to have proof.\n\nTCC collected from Legbosi with TIN\n\nImmediately, the reporter brought out the cash to give Legbosi, she brought out an envelope and requested the cash to be put inside. Our reporter put the cash inside and handed over the money to Legbosi, and told her the ATM failed to transfer the remaining N5,000 if she can share her account details for the balance to be paid. And she did it on a sheet and this reporter transferred the N5,000 balance.\n\nThe Rivers Board of Internal Revenue has also announced that acquiring a Tax Identification number is free, and it is also stated on her facebook page. Legbos asked the reporter to pay two Thousand to get RIVTIN before payment of the Tax payment to get a TCC.\n\nUnfortunately for Legbosi, the reporter had visited the Head office of the State revenue Board as regards TIN and it was done free. The reporter told Legbosi that her sister has a TIN. Legbosi shockingly looked at the reporter but she still couldn't understand the naive lady in front of her. The reporter gave her the TIN\n\nUnfortunately, the reporter didn't notice the money was short of N10,000 and Legbosi called the reporter and informed her. The reporter checked the bag where she brought out the money and saw the extra N10,000. The reporter again requested the tax officer to text her bank details to transfer extra N10,000.\n\nLegbosi sent a text of her Savings First bank account details; Legbosi Ikpabie. This reporter paid and she confirmed seeing the money via text message.\n\nUnlike IB who did not ask for a document to prove that the reporter's relative was a student; Legbosi asked. And the reporter gave her a fake Admission letter, school fees receipt all picked from the internet and edited, and a fake home address.\n\nGetting TCC at Rumuogba\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Legbosi texted the reporter that the TCC is ready. Days after, the reporter visited Legbosi at the tax office and collected the TCC. Only N30,300 was reflected on the receipt given.\n\nEarlier, Legbosi called and told the reporter that out of the N95,000 paid, N50,000 had no receipt, claiming the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office does not give receipt for penalty. She claimed the N50,000 was for penalty for failure to pay tax. Meanwhile, Legbosi never told the reporter that N50,000 would be used for the penalty. She lied again. All monies paid for any purpose in the state had a receipt especially when it was said to be paid into the bank.\n\nThe bank teller brought by Legbosi only reflected N30,300 not the N95,000 as claimed earlier.\n\nThe reporter through her TIN checked the amount paid by Legbosi online, only N30,300 was reflected, and the N50,000 penalty was never stated\n\nRIVERS STATE BOARD OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RSB\n\nRIRS Head Office\n\nRSBIR on her facebook page said it is committed to being the credible Tax Administrator and helping the good people of Rivers State understand and become responsible TAX PAYERS.\n\nThe State Government has made several efforts to ensure residents and businesses owners pay their taxes into the right bank. However, this is done through jingles in various media outlets but there are some ignorant people who would still go to the board office and seek direction to confirm the amount needed to be paid. Rather than the Revenue officers to give direction on the right payment, some officers like Legbosi and IB will still deceive and illegally charge residents yet fail to remit to the government.\n\nThe official website of the RIvers State Board rolled out banks where taxpayers can make payment. The reporter visited the headquarters of the State Revenue board at Trans-Amai to speak with the Executive Chairman, Adoage Norteh to inform her findings. The secretary to the Chairman, an advanced woman denied the report access.\n\nWhen the reporter visited State Revenue headquarters on Friday 27, October, 2020, about 1pm, some security officers told the reporter that the Chairman was in his office. The reporter introduced herself and told the secretary that she has information for the chairman. And the secretary asked the reporter if she was on appointment, the reporter said, No, and the Chairman\u2019s secretary replied, \u201cThen, you can\u2019t see him\u201d. The reporter told her she had important information to inform the chairman, the secretary said the chairman was not around.\n\nHow Headquarters collaborates with branches to defraud citizens and the Government\n\nThe reporter also put a call across to the numbers displayed on the facebook page of RSBIR identified as Joseph Iyeuma, a lady picked. This reporter asked the lady if students are to pay for TCC, and she said No with the submission of a school document. This confirms that Legbosi and Ibiere cheated taxpayers and converted taxpayers\u2019 monies to individual pockets.\n\nAgain, the reporter requested the method to dictate the authentic TCC document, and the Tax officer told the reporter to visit the TCC office at the Board headquarters, and this reporter revisited on Monday November 4, 2020.\n\nImmediately the reporter entered the reception, she asked one of the tax officers seated, the way to the TCC office, and the fair in complexion lady asked the reporter the reason for the visit. When the reporter told the officer she wanted to inquire about the authenticity of the TCC received, she was directed to the first floor.\n\nThis reporter also climbed the first floor, and the security lady on the first floor showed her the TCC office and she entered and walked straight to a young man seated close to the wall by the right, immediately you entered the TCC office. She told the tax officer that she wanted to confirm the authenticity of TCC she had gotten from other branches. \u201cMeet my boss\u201d, the tax officer said, pointing to a man at the extreme of the office.\n\nAnd, the reporter walked to the man who later identified himself as Leyiri. The reporter told Mr. Leyiri she wanted to confirm the authenticity of the TCC, he requested for the copy, and the reporter gave him the TCC she had collected from Ibiere Tonye at the revenue office at State Secretariat. He started typing a code from the TCC into his computer, afterwhich, he told the reporter to officially write to the Chairman that he is not in the position to confirm the authenticity.\n\nHaving seen several TCC on Leyiri's desk, this reporter asked him if all the TCC comes from his office. He said all TCC comes from his office after heads of the branches have done and confirmed all the process but \u201cthat is after the Chairman has approved\u201d, he said.\n\nHe told the reporter that the TCC is original. \u201cAre you scared, it is okay? Dont waste time going through the process of writing to the chairman\u201d, Leyiri said, discouraging the reporter with a smiling face. He lied. The TCC from IB is fake as it has no TIN on it. The documents including the bank receipts from Ibiere are fake. The reporter also confirmed from the bank that the teller is fake. Leyiri is also covering up the crime from tax officers cheating the government.\n\nHowever, if the TCC from Ibiere Tonye is authentic as claimed by Leyiri, that means tax officers at the Head of the Revenue Board collaborate with officers at various branches to defraud ignorant Nigerians and divert public funds into personal accounts against the government's directive thereby causing the government to lose billions.\n\nThis reporter also did not identify herself as a journalist when she revisited the Headquarters of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office to avoid harassment.\n\nDocuments: IB Fake Bank Receipt by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nDOCUMENTS: RBIR LEGBARA by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThis report is supported by HEDA Resource Agenda in collaboration with the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.",

          "title": "INVESTIGATION: How Rivers State Revenue Officers Divert Millions Of Government Funds Into Private Bank Accounts",
          "text": "In this three-month investigation, this reporter used a pseudonym name, Rose John, poses as a Diploma Student in Ken Polytechnic and paid a total sum of N195,000 to get a tax clearance certificate from two separate staff of Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue offices in Port Harcourt. However, out of the N195,000 paid, only N30,300 went into the coffers of the Rivers State Government. TCC office at the headquarters also collaborates with branch tax officers to cheat the Rivers Government. The reporter had disguised herself to look like the ignorant Nigerian which the tax officers took advantage of.\n\nThe Rivers State Government has several times warned tax officers to stop collecting cash from taxpayers. Rather, they should direct any payment to the Government designated bank, but the tax officers are illegally charging residents and then failing to remit to the government. This, they do in connivance with some bank officials.\n\nBetween August and September 2020, the Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike borrowed over N24billion to accelerate development which included construction of flyover, dualisation of road and compensation to families of demolished buildings among others. Nyesom said the fund will be repaid from the Internally Generated Revenue. What this means is that, with the constant IGR being diverted into an individual account, the Governor might not pay the loan on time. And this will affect development in the state.\n\nInside the Rivers State Secretariat, close to the Podium Block, there is a branch office of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office. Immediately the reporter got close to the entrance of the tax office, she was accosted by a dark female security lady, in blue and black trousers.\n\nThe security officer requested to know the office the reporter was heading to, and when the reporter told her she wanted to get a Tax Clearance Certificate, she was directed to a then pregnant lady called IB, chocolate in complexion.\n\nThe Discussion with IB\n\nThe reporter told IB that she wants to get a tax clearance for herself and her sister who is also a student, and it is part of a requirement to apply for a scholarship abroad. IB told her each TCC will cost N150,000 each, even when the reporter pleads that they want to use it to apply for a scholarship and they are yet to know their fate whether they will be chosen or not.\n\nThe reporter had earlier visited the state revenue branch at Aggrey Road, a fair in complexion officer told her Tax Clearance Certificate for students is free, and all she needed is to submit the school admission letter and payment of school fees receipt.\n\nBut, this is different from what the tax officer(IB) inside the state secretariat told the reporter.\n\n\u201cI will bring the price down to N100,000 each since it's for both\u201d, IB said. The reporter pleaded for the money to be reduced yet it wasn't. IB told the reporter that the amount mentioned, she will still go and discuss with her boss and plead with him to accept the amount.\n\nAfter much argument, the reporter requested IB to give her the state government's bank account number to make payment. IB bluntly told the reporter that she can't pay to the bank because they don't know her, rather she(IB) is the one the reporter needs to pay to the bank. This is contrary to what the Rivers State Government jingles says. The state government has severally said it has no agent representing the government in collection of taxes. The government has warned tax officers not to collect cash rather they should direct the payer to the bank.\n\nIB wanted cash but the reporter intentionally requested her bank account details.Happily, IB, gave the reporter her personal Guaranty Trust bank account details; Diri Ibieri Tonye. IB for short, came from Ibieri, our report understands. The reporter made a transaction of N80,000 on September 17,2020, and to also document cash received, this reporter called IB and informed her that she couldn't make the transfer again if she could bring cash immediately. Same day, the balance of N20,000.00 was given to Ibieri. This was also captured on camera.\n\nTax clearance certificate collected from IB without TIN.\n\nEvery taxpayer is expected to use their Rivers Tax Identification Number to pay their taxes. The reporter was hoping IB would request for RIVTIN but she didn't. Neither did she ask for a document to prove that the reporter\u2019s sister was a student.\n\nAlthough the reporter went with a computerised and edited scanned document as an Admission letter and an edited passport picked from the internet, IB failed to confirm if really the reporter is fake with intention to cheat the government. This act has been perpetrated by several scammers who cheat the government and most times in connivance with the staff of the Rivers Internal Revenue Board\n\nSurprisingly, two days after, IB called this reporter to come pick her tax-clearance certificate that it was ready. Ibieri persuaded the reporter to come to do the second TCC since the previous was ready. The reporter had told IB that once the TCC was ready, she would come to the second TCC for herself.\n\nThe reporter visited IB and she gave the reporter the Tax Clearance Certificate of 3years, starting from 2017, a hundred thousand Naira (N100,000) receipts from Internal Revenue Revenue, and also an stamped Access bank teller to prove to the reporter that she paid the money to the government designated bank as said earlier.\n\nTracking the Stamped Access Bank Teller\n\nThe location of the bank teller states Bank Road. Bank road is close to the state secretariat opposite the Rivers State Judiciary complex.\n\nThe reporter went into the bank to find out the authenticity of the bank teller. The first customer care she met was close to the entrance of the bank, a fair complexioned lady told the reporter, the bank teller is authentic.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see our stamp on it? said the Access bank customer care personnel, without confirming the authenticity of the receipt from the computer.\n\nBut the reporter insisted that she check the system before assuming the bank teller is authentic. The bank official reluctantly told the reporter to move to the extreme of the counter to meet the cashier for confirmation. And this reporter did.\n\n\u201cWhere did you pay this money? The receipt can't be found, said the bank cashier whom the reporter had handed over the bank teller given by the revenue officer, Ibieri. The reporter told her the revenue officer gave her the teller that the money was paid in this branch.\n\nThe reporter insisted the bank cashier should check using the name on the teller, the number and the stamp yet the bank cashier insisted that all had been done yet she could not see any of the names used in payment and the teller number was not recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, Diri Ibieri Tonye used Rose John as given by the reporter to pay the money. What this means is that the N100,000 the reporter paid for Tax Clearance was not paid to the government's bank account; rather, it was paid to the Tax officer of Rivers State Internal revenue board.\n\nThe bank teller and computer printout given to the reporter by IB were also fake, and this can be possible with the help of a bank official.\n\nOn a separate day, the reporter visited the Rumuogba board of Internal Revenue close to Mini-okoro police station. Immediately she entered the reception by the right is an office occupied by two tax officers, a man and a fair woman.\n\nThe reporter moved to the first person, a dark man and told him she wanted to get a tax clearance and he pointed to the other lady, fair in complexion, who identified herself as Legbosi.\n\nLegbosi was attending to a customer, immediately the reporter met her and told her she wanted TCC for herself and her sister, and they are students. This reporter made her aware of the urgency of the TCC to enable her to apply for a scholarship abroad. Immediately, Legbosi brought out a pen, wrote down her telephone contact and told the reporter to go home and call her at 4pm. Earlier, Legbosi had told the reporter to get the school admission letter, ID card and receipt. The reporter, knowing she can't easily get the school ID card, she quickly told Legbosi that she is yet to be given an ID card from the school since 2018.\n\nThis reporter was disguised and looked unkempt when she visited Legbosi's office and pretended to be among the ignorant Nigerians. So, Legbosi, a senior tax officer, decided to take advantage of her looks to cheat her.\n\nIn the evening, this reporter called Legbosi who told her to pay N150,000 after much pleading, the reporter stood her ground on N95,000 and the tax officer, Legbosi agreed. It took over two months before Legbosi agreed for N95,000. This was when the reporter suddenly visited the tax office and told her what they agreed on the phone was N95,000. Legbosi could not remember how much she had told the reporter.\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the reporter visited the tax office, hoping that the state government account would be given to make payment. Legbosi requested cash. The reporter told her to give the state account to make payment but Legbosi said the money was to be paid to her while she would pay to the bank. Just like her colleague Ibiere at the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office inside the state secretariat.\n\nThe reporter requested her bank account and she refused and told the reporter to go across the office and do a withdrawal. Outside the office is the police microfinance bank. The reporter went outside and withdrew the N90,000 and intentionally left N5,000 to be transferred into Legbosi bank to have proof.\n\nTCC collected from Legbosi with TIN\n\nImmediately, the reporter brought out the cash to give Legbosi, she brought out an envelope and requested the cash to be put inside. Our reporter put the cash inside and handed over the money to Legbosi, and told her the ATM failed to transfer the remaining N5,000 if she can share her account details for the balance to be paid. And she did it on a sheet and this reporter transferred the N5,000 balance.\n\nThe Rivers Board of Internal Revenue has also announced that acquiring a Tax Identification number is free, and it is also stated on her facebook page. Legbos asked the reporter to pay two Thousand to get RIVTIN before payment of the Tax payment to get a TCC.\n\nUnfortunately for Legbosi, the reporter had visited the Head office of the State revenue Board as regards TIN and it was done free.

And the reporter gave her a fake Admission letter, school fees receipt all picked from the internet and edited, and a fake home address.\n\nGetting TCC at Rumuogba\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Legbosi texted the reporter that the TCC is ready. Days after, the reporter visited Legbosi at the tax office and collected the TCC. Only N30,300 was reflected on the receipt given.\n\nEarlier, Legbosi called and told the reporter that out of the N95,000 paid, N50,000 had no receipt, claiming the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office does not give receipt for penalty. She claimed the N50,000 was for penalty for failure to pay tax. Meanwhile, Legbosi never told the reporter that N50,000 would be used for the penalty. She lied again. All monies paid for any purpose in the state had a receipt especially when it was said to be paid into the bank.\n\nThe bank teller brought by Legbosi only reflected N30,300 not the N95,000 as claimed earlier.\n\nThe reporter through her TIN checked the amount paid by Legbosi online, only N30,300 was reflected, and the N50,000 penalty was never stated\n\nRIVERS STATE BOARD OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RSB\n\nRIRS Head Office\n\nRSBIR on her facebook page said it is committed to being the credible Tax Administrator and helping the good people of Rivers State understand and become responsible TAX PAYERS.\n\nThe State Government has made several efforts to ensure residents and businesses owners pay their taxes into the right bank.

          "text": "The Akwa Ibom State Police Command has announced that Uduak Frank Akpan, the suspected killer of a job seeker, Iniubong Umoren will be paraded on Friday to dismiss rumour of his death in custody.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, who made this known in a telephone conversation with SaharaReporters, lamented that people are frustrating police's efforts.\n\nHe explained that it is not possible for the police to allow a suspect to commit suicide in detention.\n\n\"How can we allow him to commit suicide? How can he hang himself by tying his trousers to the metal frame of his cell door? How?\" He said.\n\nSocial media was set on fire on Wednesday when rumour surfaced that Uduak Akpan committed suicide at the Akwa Ibom police headquarters, Ikot Akpanabia, Uyo, the state capital while in detention.\n\nMeanwhile, The Commissioner of Police, CP Andrew Amiengheme, has also refuted claims that the suspect committed suicide while in custody.\n\nThe police commissioner described the rumour as the figment of the writer\u2019s imagination, wondered why some people would derive pleasure in peddling falsehood.\n\nHe noted that the police would not be distracted with speculations.\n\n\u201dIt is not true that Uduak Akpan has committed suicide.

          "title": "Looking Back: Forty-five Years Ago By Edwin Madunagu",
          "text": "Forty-five years ago, as I turned 30, I left Lagos for Ibadan. From Ibadan, together with a comrade of the same age, I left for a rural community somewhere between Gbongan and Ile-Ife in present-day Osun State. There we joined others, similarly inspired like us, about ten in number, male and female, excluding two kids whom we took turns to \u201cbaby-sit\u201d in order to free the mother to participate fully in revolutionary duties.\n\nWe assembled to inaugurate an underground Marxist revolutionary vanguard embedded in the peasantry. While some members were fully in residence, others were semi-resident, but continually in touch with the Headquarters. I was not only fully in residence, but disappeared to the outside world for between 9 and 12 months.\n\nThe strategic objective of that Extraordinary Expedition was to inaugurate an armed struggle in a socialist revolution which we recognized had been going on at a certain level in our country, Nigeria. The armed struggle did not happen. But it almost did. And in an attempt to force it to begin, we also almost ended up in self-liquidation.\n\nIt was when I was leaving the Headquarters after the collapse of the Expedition that our peasant comrades knew, through my contact address and full name, that not only was I not an Ijesha man, but that I was not even of Yoruba parentage. For I had integrated completely with them and had been one of their conscientisation discussion leaders in the Yoruba language for at least the preceding six months. The scene of separation was so emotional.\n\nThe Extraordinary Expedition had profound effects on all the participants. But, as expected, the effects were of different kinds on different comrades, with some differences less significant than others. It was this variation in differences that made it possible for Biodun Jeyifo (BJ) and I, then Bene, to regroup almost immediately after the collapse of the Expedition.\n\nEdwin Madunagu\n\nPersonally, the effects of that Ode-Omu Extraordinary Expedition were completely transforming. I emerged from the commune a professional revolutionary: where to be a professional revolutionary was not conceived mechanically, for instance, in the way one is a professional teacher or a professional soldier, that is, in terms of training and occupation. It was not even conceived in the sense of making \u201crevolution\u201d the primary interest in one\u2019s life. Rather, to be a professional revolutionary was conceived in the sense of compelling every other interest or commitment \u2013 including nationality, sub-nationality, religion, family, friendship and engagements for material sustenance and reproduction to find accommodation and justification in the commitment to revolution.\n\nBut that is just one side of a professional revolutionary as conceived by me. The other side is the commitment to what Karl Marx, in his youthful days, called \u201ccategorical imperatives,\u201d that is, the \u201cstruggle to overcome all circumstances in which the human being is humiliated, enslaved, abandoned and despised.\u201d And later I added the commitment to struggle to extend immediate and unconditional solidarity to the \u201cwretched of the earth\u201d and ameliorate the human condition anywhere a professional revolutionary finds herself or himself. A professional revolutionary is thus a contradiction in the real world: simultaneous toughness and softness.\n\nThe requirement sketched above is not a necessary one for every Leftist or even for every revolutionary. But it is a self-imposed requirement for every vanguard in the struggle against capitalism, capitalist social formations and imperialism. Some would say that for a sustainable revolution to take place there must be a substantial number of this category of revolutionaries. But I would modify this and say that at least the revolution should be capable of rapidly reproducing its own professionals as it proceeds.\n\nMy life as a professional revolutionary since the 1977 collapse of the Extraordinary Expedition has therefore been a contradictory one at least in the sense described in the preceding paragraphs. And it has been tough for that person who, in addition to having to share that life as a wife, a comrade and a lover, also has to live her life as an academic, an intellectual, a mother, a social activist, a Leftist-feminist and a revolutionary socialist. If there is any person who, since 1977, has kept me on my feet, stood with me as equal, pointing out what can be done today in anticipation of tomorrow, and correcting my frequent tactical and strategic errors, that person is Comrade Professor Bene Madunagu.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, on the eve of 2021 May Day, Comrade Bene and I made a re-affirmation and executed a long-standing decision of ours. The former was the re-affirmation of our subscription to Marxism, commitment to socialist revolution in Nigeria and world-wide and to revolutionary internationalism.\n\nAnd the latter was the decision to transfer our Combined Archives and Libraries, built up since 1973, to the Nigerian Left. Following this definitive step, we established an 8-member Board of Advisers (BOA) to manage the Combined Archives and Libraries on behalf and in the name of the Nigerian Left.\n\nThis took effect on May 1, 2021. Any further announcement or action on this subject will be made or taken by the Board.\n\nLet the struggle continue.\n\nMadunagu, mathematician and journalist, writes from Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria.",

We may not always agree on all issues, but for once, let us agree to make Nigeria work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough tribes and tongues may differ, in brotherhood we stand as one, in order to lead the way for other African countries to follow suit. The only hope Africa as a continent has is that Nigeria will one day lead the way for the liberation of the continent economically and politically. Our country is indeed a force to be reckoned with not just in Africa but the world. Therefore, we must change the ugly narrative of disunity among our people to be able to provide the much-expected leadership for the continent. However, we must set our house in order; charity they say begins at home.\n\nTherefore, we must put our differences aside, and focus on the bigger picture which is to build a heterogeneous society; where the oppressed will no longer be oppressed, where there will be equal right, fairness, and justice for all, where no one will be discriminated against based on his or her tongue, where the majority and the minority will both have their say on how the country is governed, where as citizens, we will be able to live freely in any part of the country without any fear of threat to life and property.\n\nHowever, it is reassuring to see leaders rising up to speak on the need to chart a new course for the country.

We hope this will not be a mere talk but matched with the required action plan for us to see the result. The governors must endeavor to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d for them to be taken seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, I look forward to seeing their counterparts from the north do the same in the interest of the country. This is a collective responsibility we all owe the country. No matter your political, economic, religious, or social status, you and I have a role to play in rebuilding our country into a more peaceful and prosperous nation to the delight of our people, the African continent, and indeed, the international community.\n\nNigeria is currently bleeding but we have a duty as a people to stop the bleeding by our actions and inactions. This is our home; we have no choice but to make it work again.\n\nThere is only one solution to the multifaceted problems beleaguering this country and once the solution is applied, every other thing will naturally fall in place. Restructure! Restructure!! Restructure!!!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet the restructuring process begin in earnest. I leave us with the famous song by Chief Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye aka King Sunny Ade:\n\nCome make we lift am o!\n\nLift make I lift\n\nCome, make we lift Nigeria up\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLift, make I lift\n\nThis Nigeria na we own\n\nMake e no pafuka\n\nNo place wey be like our home\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHome, sweet home\n\nMake we join hands and think alike\n\nLift make I lift\u2026!\n\nJohn Kokome, a communications strategist & public affairs analyst, writes from Lagos.

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "title": "Seerbit\u2019s Omoniyi Kolade wants financial inclusion for all Africans",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I learned two things about the man. He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nYinka Awosanya here.\n\nHow was your Sallah break?\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTesla\u2019s suspension of Bitcoin payments\n\nTwitter\u2019s product team\n\nTesla\u2019s suspension of Bitcoin payments\n\nThe price of Bitcoin dropped by as much as 15% in the later hours of Wednesday, May 12, 2021, after Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, revealed in a tweet that his car company is suspending Bitcoin as a means of payment. The suspension was attributed to the use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe why now question: In January 2021, Musk lent his support to Bitcoin, which included changing his Twitter bio to \u201c#bitcoin\u201d. This led to a significant increase in the price of the cryptocurrency, and a month later, Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. In March, Musk tweeted that Tesla would start accepting Bitcoin payments. All these moves in the last couple of months only to suspend the cryptocurrency as a payment option.\n\nIt\u2019s only a suspension that would be in effect until Bitcoin mining transitions to more sustainable energy. So there\u2019s likely a future for Bitcoin and Tesla.\n\nThe Elon Musk effect: In the past, Musk\u2019s tweets have proven to have ramifications on financial markets. Earlier in January, he tweeted \u201cGamestonk!!\u201d with a link to a WallStreetBets stock trading discussion group on Reddit, which contributed to the change in Gamestop\u2019s story afterwards.\n\nIn 2018, Musk tweeted that enough funding had been secured to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The tweet prompted an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that cost Tesla a $20 million in settlement and another $20 million from Musk and his chairmanship. There are also instances where Musk has tweeted about cryptocurrencies in the last couple of months, leading to an increase in prices.\n\nTwitter\u2019s product team has woken up\n\nJoining the likes of Facebook and Instagram, Twitter has added audio recording as a feature. The feature, which is available to both Android and iOS users, allows users to send voice notes via DMs. The voice note feature is coming after a couple of features have been introduced on the microblogging platform within the last few months.\n\nNo crop: With a tweet on May 5, Twitter announced that users will now be able to view vertical images completely in their feeds without having to click on the photo. Now you don\u2019t always have to click a vertical photo to view it fully. Twitter, in response to a tweet, said, \u201cImages with 2:1 and 3:4 aspect ratios will show in full.\u201d\n\nTip Jar: A day after introducing \u201cno crop,\u201d Twitter started testing Tip Jar as a way to send and receive money without leaving Twitter. In the blog post introducing Tip Jar, Senior Product Manager at Twitter, Esther Crawford wrote: \u201cYou drive the conversation on Twitter and we want to make it easier for you to support each other beyond Follows, Retweets, and Likes.\u201d\n\nCurrently, payment services that can be added include Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpaces for Android users was also introduced in the last couple of months. Twitter also rolled out improved prompts earlier this month as a feature that encourages people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply before they hit send. The platform started testing prompts in 2020.\n\nOther products that are coming include voice tweet for Android and the web this year.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City, Nigeria\u2026Over 30 Nigerian Civil Society organisations have opposed the Archbishop of Canterbury support for Shell Carbon Energy Plan, and have requested the Archbishop to withdraw such support for a favourable Church of England position.\n\nIn a letter of 10th May 2021 signed by over 30 civil society organisations, convener of the groups, the Rev David Ugolor ANEEJ said that even though the organisation agree with the Archbishop that \u2018we all have moral and financial responsibility to address the climate emergency\u2019, they are \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 and \u2018concerned\u2019 that the Church of England\u2019s Pension Board is lending its moral and financial authority to Shell, and plans to vote for Shell\u2019s climate and energy plan at its 2021 Annual Meeting.\n\n\u2018Nigeria has deep experience with Shell, and as representatives of Nigerian citizens\u2019 groups we wish to tell you that we feel that the company is the opposite of accountable to most Nigerians, and has a track record of making misleading statements and commitments. Shell should not be rewarded for setting a long-term ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nWe need urgent action now, starting this year. It is not acceptable for the Church to sign off on a Shell plan for this decade that makes no absolute carbon emission reduction pledges, includes huge increases in gas production, and relies on improbably large amounts of tree-planting. Indeed, Shell\u2019s rush to find land for \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 might well lead to further carbon colonialism, slavery and human rights violations in the global south. Aiming for net-zero carbon emissions has become another effort by polluting entities like Shell to avoid cutting emissions but rather continue in the harmful practices that drive global warming.\n\nNet zero is not zero emissions. It simply means polluting and assuming the equivalent amount of carbon is absorbed by trees or is mechanically captured and stored by an assortment of risky and unregulated geo-engineering proposals. Endorsing Shell\u2019s plan is akin to handing the corporation a right to toy with planetary systems while the poor and vulnerable continue to fight a losing battle against global warming\u2019, the CSO letter to The Most Revd. Justin Welby read.\n\nThe groups said that they strongly disagree with the Church of England position that the Shell goal on Carbon Emissions is \u2018clear and unambiguous, and Shell is accountable for delivering that target\u201d.\n\nThe letter to Archbishop Justin Welby said that because the Church of England has an important voice in the world on many topics, it must take responsibility to lead engagement with the company on behalf of the Climate Action 100+, an initiative involving over 500 investors worth $54 trillion.\n\n\u2018With the effects of climate change more visible every year, the future of our children is at stake, in Nigeria, Africa and around the world. We hope that you hear our call, and take urgent steps to ensure that the church reconsiders its position on Shell. Endorsing the cynical climate plan offered by Shell would mean believing that Earth systems operate according to the principles of calculus and negates the truth that the Earth is a wonderfully created system of interdependent and complex systems that no man can control by mechanical contraptions or imaginations for the sole aim of meeting shareholder\u2019s pleasure. We urge you to use all the tools available to you to encourage all parts of the Church of England to challenge Shell, rather than champion the corporation\u2019s climate and energy plan.\n\nWe pray you to continue to support our demands for ecological justice and the protection of our environment and will be happy to continue the dialogue with you as we look forward to a positive response\u2019, the letter to Archbishop Welby stated.\n\nCivil Society organisations that signed the petition against the Church of England support for Shell Climate Reduction Plan include:\n\n1.

It is hoped that at the end of first phase of the project, 4250 indigenes of Edo State will be empowered. The LIFE-ND is aimed at enhancing the income, food security and job creation for youths and women in rural areas of the Niger Delta,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr. Peter Aikhuomobhogbe said \u201cThe project is geared towards supporting women and youths in agricultural enterprises. The ongoing training will strengthen incubators with strong agric enterprises so that they can take in incubate to enable them to support themselves and have sustainable livelihood.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has said the government is deploying technology to deal with insecurity in the state, urging residents to give relevant information that will assist the government in protecting the lives and property of citizens.\n\nThe governor said this while playing host to Muslim faithful at the Government House in Benin City, as part of activities to celebrate the Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cNation building starts with the individual and in Edo State, I believe that is what we have started. We would continue to work to improve security, which is local as no one can come to your neighborhood, places of worship without someone noticing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has its own responsibility. We can\u2019t wait for them; we must secure ourselves. We are using technology to secure Edo State. Security is local and it is only you that can secure yourself. The problem is that people are reluctant to say anything for fear of being accused, but we are reorganising and changing the narrative in Edo, as we are giving our people a voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building a Command and Control Centre where people can lodge reports and reach the government directly with information on what is going on across the state. We are buying drones, installing cameras and using technology to secure Edo people because the security of all Edo citizens is our prime responsibility,\u201d he noted.\n\nUrging Nigerians to refrain from stoking the embers of disunity and disaffection, the governor noted: \u201cThe biggest problem in Nigeria today is disaffection. The world is changing but people refuse to change but rather causing disaffection across the country pointing to the disunity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people that are not getting what they desire want Nigeria to fail. They are misguided and have failed, as Nigeria will remain united and will not disintegrate. We must not promote disaffection, but do things fairly. Once there is justice and fairness in the land, it will certainly reduce disaffection bringing in peace and harmony.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is a great country as God has given us a diverse country, diverse in everything, particularly its people. Everybody can\u2019t be the same or see things the same way or behave the same way. We have not come from the same tribe, but our beauty as a nation is in our diversity,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat we should do as Nigeria is to bring out the uniqueness in Nigerians that made us great. There is nothing wrong with diversity; it is important and beneficial. We should continue to emphasize unity in diversity as it makes us strong as a nation.\n\n\u201cWhen we complain about Nigeria not working, we are actually complaining about ourselves. But collectively, we can make the country great. We can\u2019t lay the blame of the nation solely on the footsteps of a few people. There may be failure in leadership; there is also failure in followership.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdulfattah Enabulele said, \u201cEdo remains one of the peaceful states in Nigeria and I urge us all to guard it jealously.\u201d\n\n...",

At least four have PhDs and two are professors.\n\nThe only governor without a university degree is Aminu Masari of Katsina State.\n\nSix governors have a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting from Nigerian universities, a review of their official resumes have shown.\n\nThe accounting graduates are the governors of Akwa Ibom, Emmanuel Udom; Gombe, Inuwa Yahaya; Jigawa, Badaru Abubakar; Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Anambra, Willie Obiano; and Ogun, Dapo Abiodun.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES\u2019 review of the details further shows that like accounting, six governors have degrees in law. Thus, one-third (12) of Nigeria\u2019s state governors studied either accounting or law.\n\nThose with law degrees include the governors of Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Rivers, Nyesome Wike; Plateau, Simon Lalong; Sokoto, Aminu Tambuwal; Cross Rivers, Ben Ayade; and Kaduna, Nasir El-Rufai.\n\nAfter having first and second degrees in Nigeria, Mr El-Rufai received a law degree from the University of London in 2008.\n\nAlready, PREMIUM TIMES had established that about a third of the current ministers in the country are law graduates while five each have degrees in engineering, business and public administration.\n\nIn a similar fashion, behind accounting and law, engineering and business administration are the courses most studied by the governors.\n\nBabagana Zulum of Borno; Dave Umahi of Ebonyi; and Seyi Makinde of Oyo all studied engineering programmes.\n\nThe governors of Enugu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi; Osun, Gboyega Oyetola; Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Mr Bello and Mr El-Rufai have degrees in business administration. All but Mr Ugwuanyi studied business administration to master\u2019s level.\n\nMessrs El-Rufai and Sanwo-Olu studied quantity surveying at first degree level while governors Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State obtained bachelor\u2019s degrees in history.\n\nOther courses\n\nThe governor of Delta, Ifeanyi Okowa, studied medicine while his counterpart in Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, studied finance and international business.\n\nChikezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has a bachelor\u2019s degree in clinical biochemistry.\n\nBauchi\u2019s Bala Mohammed studied English, while his counterpart in Bayelsa State, Duoye Diri, studied political science.\n\nBenue State governor, Samuel Ortom, studied personal management up to PhD level while Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics.\n\nQualifications\n\nAll the governors but one have at least one university degree and Ahmadu Bello University is the institution where the most degrees were obtained, the review of their credentials show.\n\nFourteen of the serving governors have both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe quartet of Mr Ikpeazu; Samuel Ortom of Benue; Mr Fayemi and Kano\u2019s Abdullahi Ganduje, all have PhD degrees.\n\nCross Rivers State\u2019s Ben Ayade and Mr Zulum are professors.\n\nDouble Honours\n\nImo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, has an ordinary and higher diploma in Maritime Management Technology from the Federal University of Technology Owerri. He went on to study diplomacy and international relations at Washington University in St Louis.\n\nMr El-Rufai has two bachelor\u2019s degrees and two master\u2019s degrees. The first bachelor degree was in quantity surveying and the first masters in business administration at Ahmadu Bello University; then another bachelor\u2019s in law at the University of London and a masters in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University\n\nLike Mr El-Rufai, Mr Sanwo-Olu of Lagos has a bachelor\u2019s in surveying and an MBA from the University of Lagos. He also has a master\u2019s in public administration from John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\nHe is an associate member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management (CIPM) and a fellow of the Nigeria Institute of Training and Development (NITAD).\n\nIn the same vein, Darius Ishaku, the governor of Taraba State is a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Architects (FNIA) and also a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (FNITP).\n\nHe has bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in architecture and an additional master\u2019s degree in urban and regional planning.",

          "text": "*Begs Nigerians to show more understanding on insecurity\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has assured that his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.\n\nThe President, according to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made the call in a chat with State House correspondents shortly after observing the Eid-il-Fitr prayers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast, on Thursday.\n\nAccording to him, the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\nThe President, who hoped for a good rainy season this year, said \u201cthe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land.\n\n\u201cThis is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for its support, saying that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well.\n\nWithin the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nHe, however, appealed to the nation\u2019s elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military.\n\nIf we order for weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field.\n\nThis is a very long process,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe President also appealed to Nigerians to show more understanding on the current security situation in the country.\n\nHe also urged the Nigerian elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\nBuhari has been under increasing pressure from Nigerians to find a lasting solution to the country\u2019s worst security challenges since independence.\n\nHe said: \u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we came in, in the North-East, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security.\n\n\u201cWithout security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the North West and we are dealing with it.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturer.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari assured Nigerians that his administration would use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits and other criminals wreaking havoc in many parts of the country.",

          "text": "*Woos Urhobo union to intervene\n\nBy Nosa Akenzua, Asaba\n\nThe Federal Government has written to the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) to beg former Delta State Governor, Chief James Ibori to withdraw his suit against the United Kingdom on the planned repatriation of about \u00a34.2 million linked to him.\n\nThe government also said that should the UPU intervene in the matter, it would create an enabling environment for the consideration of the appeal by the union that the looted asset be used to implement projects in Delta state.\n\nRecall that the UPU, under the leadership of Engineer Joseph Omene, had asked the Nigerian Government to use the said loot to implement projects in the state when it is repatriated.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Omene, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, noted that the suit filed by Chief Ibori against the United Kingdom on the confiscated assets has become a stumbling block for repatriation.\n\nThe AGF letter with the title, \u201cRe-Commendation for Retrieval of Delta\u2019s Stolen Funds and request for Review of Projects to be Executed with the Retrieved Funds\u201d, was signed by Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu, the Special Assistant to the President on Justice Reform and International Relations.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI am directed to inform (you) that the HAGF is in receipt of your letter dated 23rd March 2021 with regard to the above subject matter.\n\nThe HAGF appreciates your concerns and welcomes the interest of UPU in the returned assets.\n\n\u201cThe HAGF wishes to inform that he does not have the authority to approve projects for the application of returned assets.\n\nThese decisions are taken at the Federal Executive Council after in-depth deliberations. The HAGF\u2019s mandate is to implement the decisions of the council.\n\n\u201cI am also directed to inform further that the decision of the council is also guided by bilateral negotiations between Nigeria and the country from which the asset will be returned.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Nigeria and the government of the United Kingdom or any other country for that matter must agree on a specific project in a transparent and accountable manner before a project is approved.\n\n\u201cHowever, the HAGF has directed that I inform you that the stumbling block in negotiating the return of assets linked to Ibori to Nigeria is the ongoing litigation by Mr James Ibori against the government of United Kingdom in the confiscation hearing in London.\n\n\u201cIt is advisable that you approach Mr James Ibori to advise him to withdraw his appeals against the confiscation and repatriation of the assets linked to him, his family, and associates back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is the only way to provide an enabling environment for negotiation of the use of the identified assets for Delta State.\u201d\n\nSources say the Urhobos have been very angry with the way the Attorney General of the Federation have been handling the issue, adding that \u201cWe will do everything possible for us to have the money returned to Delta State Government and be Judiciously used for the development of the State.\u201d\n\nBut Olorogun David Oghenefejiro who spoke to our correspondent said \u201cWhy is it that Deltans are interested in the stolen by Chief Ibori.\n\nThe money as far as I am concerned should not be released to Delta State Government, otherwise the state government will steal the money.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Ehiedu Aniagwu said \u201cWe are very much interested in the return of the money not for squander but to be used for the provision of more infrastructural development in Delta State.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has no reason not release the money to us because a lot has been said. Malami writing Urhobos in any way will not offer any solution rather than to ensure that the money is release to the State.\n\nOkowa has done a lot to Justify good governance and if there anybody else saying that the money should not be released, it means the person or persons are enemies of developments\u201d",

We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Watching Israel-Palestine Conflict With \u2018Great Concern\u2019 \u2013 Foreign Ministry\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against the bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHe said his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming growing season.\n\n\u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources. For example, when we came in, in the Northeast, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest and we are dealing with it,\u201d said the President.\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, President Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\nHe also commended the National Assembly for its support, saying that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari then made an appeal to the nation\u2019s elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armored vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers. It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, the Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members, and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.",

          "title": "Israel Threatens Gaza Ground Invasion Despite Truce Efforts",
          "text": "Israel on Thursday said it was massing troops along the Gaza frontier and calling up 9,000 reservists ahead of a possible ground invasion of the Hamas-ruled territory, as the two bitter enemies plunged closer to all-out war. Egyptian mediators rushed to Israel for cease-fire efforts but showed no signs of progress.\n\nThe stepped-up fighting came as communal violence in Israel erupted for a fourth night, with Jewish and Arab mobs clashing in the flashpoint town of Lod. The fighting took place despite a bolstered police presence ordered by the nation\u2019s leaders.\n\nThe four-day burst of violence has pushed Israel into uncharted territory \u2014 dealing with the most intense fighting it has ever had with Hamas while simultaneously coping with the worst Jewish-Arab violence inside Israel in decades.\n\nA late-night barrage of rocket fire from Lebanon that landed in the sea threatened to open a new front along Israel\u2019s northern border.\n\nSaleh Aruri, an exiled senior Hamas leader, told London-based satellite channel Al Araby early Friday that his group has turned down a proposal for a three-hour lull to allow for more negotiations toward a full cease-fire. He said Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations were leading the truce efforts.\n\nAlso early Friday, the Israeli military said air and ground troops struck Gaza in what appeared to be the heaviest attacks yet. Masses of red flames illuminated the skies as the deafening blasts from the outskirts of Gaza City jolted people awake. The strikes were so strong that screams of fear could be heard from people inside the city, several kilometers away.\n\n\u201cI said we would extract a very heavy price from Hamas,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a videotaped statement. \u201cWe are doing that, and we will continue to do that with heavy force.\u201d\n\nThe fighting broke out late Monday when Hamas, claiming to be the defender of Jerusalem, fired a barrage of long-range rockets toward the city in response to what it said were Israeli provocations. Israel quickly responded with a series of airstrikes.\n\nSince then, Israel has attacked hundreds of targets in Gaza. The strikes set off scores of earth-shaking explosions across the densely populated territory. Gaza militants have fired nearly 2,000 rockets into Israel, bringing life in the southern part of the country to a standstill. Several barrages targeted the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.\n\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry said the death toll has climbed to 109 Palestinians, including 28 children and 15 women, with 621 people wounded. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups have confirmed 20 deaths in their ranks, though Israel says that number is much higher. Seven people have been killed in Israel, including a 6-year-old boy.\n\nIn Washington, President Joe Biden said he spoke with Netanyahu about calming the fighting but also backed the Israeli leader by saying \u201cthere has not been a significant overreaction.\u201d\n\nHe said the goal now is to \u201cget to a point where there is a significant reduction in attacks, particularly rocket attacks that are indiscriminately fired into population centers.\u201d He called the effort a \u201ca work in progress.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s visit by Egyptian officials marked an important step in the cease-fire efforts.\n\nEgypt often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, and it has been a key player in ending past rounds of fighting. The officials met first with Hamas leaders in Gaza before holding talks with Israelis in Tel Aviv, two Egyptian intelligence officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Hamas\u2019 exiled leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was also in touch with the Egyptians, the group said.\n\nDespite those efforts, the fighting only intensified. Israeli aircraft pummeled targets in Gaza throughout the day. And late Thursday, Israel fired tank and artillery shells across the border for the first time, sending scores of terrified residents fleeing for safety.\n\nThe airstrikes have destroyed scores of buildings, including three high rises. Israel says the buildings housed Hamas militants or facilities, but civilians were inside as well.\n\nIn the northern Gaza Strip, Rafat Tanani, his pregnant wife and four children were killed after an Israeli warplane reduced the building to rubble, residents said.\n\nSadallah Tanani, a relative, said the family was \u201cwiped out from the population register\u201d without warning. \u201cIt was a massacre. My feelings are indescribable,\u201d he said.\n\nIsrael has come under heavy international criticism for civilian casualties in Gaza fighting. It says Hamas is responsible for endangering civilians by hiding and launching rockets from civilian areas.\n\nLate Thursday, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Benny Gantz ordered the mobilization of an additional 9,000 reservists.\n\nThe chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Hidai Zilberman, said troops were massing along the Gaza border for a possible ground operation. He said tanks, armored vehicles and artillery were being prepared \u201cfor mobilization at any given moment.\u201d\n\nHamas showed no signs of backing down. It launched several intense barrages of rockets throughout the day and fired its most powerful rocket, the Ayyash, nearly 200 kilometers (120 miles) into southern Israel. The rocket landed in the open desert but briefly disrupted flight traffic at the southern Ramon airport. Hamas also launched a drone that Israel said it quickly shot down.\n\nHamas military spokesman Abu Obeida said the group was not afraid of a ground invasion, saying any invasion would be a chance \u201cto increase our catch\u201d of dead or captive soldiers.\n\nThe fighting cast a pall over the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, normally marked by family gatherings and festive meals. Instead, the streets of Gaza were mostly empty.\n\nHassan Abu Shaaban tried to lighten the mood by passing out candy to passers-by but acknowledged \u201cthere is no atmosphere\u201d for celebrating. \u201cIt is all airstrikes, destruction and devastation,\u201d he said. \u201cMay God help everyone.\u201d\n\nThe current eruption of violence began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers ignited protests and clashes with police. A focal point of clashes was Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on a hilltop compound that is revered by Jews and Muslims.\n\nIsrael regards Jerusalem in its entirety as its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.\n\nThe violent clashes between Arabs and Jews in Israel resulted in scenes not witnessed in more than two decades.\n\nThe confrontations erupted again late Thursday. Jewish and Arab mobs battled in the central city of Lod, the epicenter of the troubles, for a fourth consecutive night, despite a state of emergency and heavy police presence. A Jewish man was shot and seriously wounded, and Israeli media said a second Jewish man was shot.\n\nIn the Tel Aviv neighborhood of Jaffa, an Israeli soldier was attacked by a group of Arabs and hospitalized in serious condition.\n\nThe fighting deepened a political crisis that has sent Israel careening through four inconclusive elections in just two years. After March elections, Netanyahu failed to form a government coalition. Now his political rivals have three weeks to try to do so.\n\nThose efforts have been greatly complicated by the fighting. His opponents include a broad range of parties that have little in common. They would need the support of an Arab party, whose leader has said he cannot negotiate while Israel is fighting in Gaza.\n\nNaftali Bennett, leader of a small right-wing party, was quoted as saying he did not believe an alternate coalition could be formed in the current atmosphere.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid, who is leading the coalition-building efforts, said the country was facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d and urged Bennett to join him to help rescue the country.\n\n\u201cWe are on the brink of the abyss,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Also early Friday, the Israeli military said air and ground troops struck Gaza in what appeared to be the heaviest attacks yet.\nGaza militants have fired nearly 2,000 rockets into Israel, bringing life in the southern part of the country to a standstill.\nAnd late Thursday, Israel fired tank and artillery shells across the border for the first time, sending scores of terrified residents fleeing for safety.\nIsrael has come under heavy international criticism for civilian casualties in Gaza fighting.\nThey would need the support of an Arab party, whose leader has said he cannot negotiate while Israel is fighting in Gaza.",
