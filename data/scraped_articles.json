Any other way is patently illegal and even treasonable. Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\n\n\u201cThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country.

My position is based on the fact that entering into dialogue with them may not necessarily mean that government must have to pay them money. It could be an avenue to know their grouse and why they have such grouse with whosoever or whatsoever they have such.\n\n\u201cAssuming that the bandits even want to be paid some money, if the government is not interested in paying any money, let the government allow the parents to raise the money and pay. I heard that the parents had raised and paid the bandits over N50 million though I was not privy to that.\n\n\u201cThe government cannot just stay aloof and not do anything. Are the children of government officials among the innocent students being traumatised? The answer may be probably no. I plead with the bandits on behalf of all Nigerian parents to spare the lives of these children. They should not allow their faceoff with the government to push them to do evil. None of the children of the governor is among the victims.\n\n\u201cThe bandits should also fear God and spare these children. The shedding of innocent blood should stop. We cannot continue this way. We are not only killing education in the country, we are hurting and putting the future of Nigeria in jeopardy, \u201d he said.\n\nRecall that on April 20, this year, some students and a staff member of Greenfield University, Kaduna State were abducted and some days later, five of them were killed.\n\nOn Monday, the group threatened to kill the remaining 17 unless they are paid N100 million ransom and provided with 10 brand new motorcycles by today, Tuesday.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

They were initially billed to appear on Tuesday. Their appearance was deferred, following a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari already slated for Tuesday.\n\nLawan said during the briefing, senators will decide if a supplementary budget will be approved by the National Assembly to enable security agencies tackle the nationwide insecurity.\n\nLawan said: \u201cThey (Service Chiefs) were to come today (yesterday) at 11 am to brief the Senate on the security situation. Today, the National Security Council is continuing its meeting that it started last week. Therefore the invited security head will not be able to come for the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure if they will finish their meeting today. We assume it could spill to Wednesday too. Just like it spilt from Thursday to Tuesday. So to be on the side of caution. We have now fix the date for the briefing to be Thursday, 6.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to all of us that the briefing will take from the Service Chiefs and other security agencies will be very crucial for us to be properly informed, properly guided and that if there is any request for a supplementary budget, we should be able to understand why we should consider and approve such request.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday, the only item on the order paper will be the briefing.

For example, almost 54 Million people have obtained their NIN and this can translate to up to 190 Million mobile numbers, since empirical evidence suggests that each unique NIN maps to 3 to 4 phone lines. The much awaited Android enrolment system is now ready for deployment and this has the potential to significantly accelerate the speed and ease of enrolments.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the telecom providers and other enrolment agents have also opened several centres across the country to make it easier for eligible citizens and residents to obtain and link their NINs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has approved the extension as part of its effort to make it easier for its citizens and residents to obtain the NIN and it is important to take advantage of the extension. Dr Pantami wishes to thank Nigerians for their patience and compliance with the Federal Government\u2019s directive on the NIN-SIM registration exercise. He again reiterated government\u2019s commitment to continually taking decisions aimed at easing the pains of the citizens with regard to issues related to NIN and SIM registration.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State. This influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat; our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the government had taken steps to ensure that the threat did not turn into an attack, adding that \u201cprofiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs, will be done in order to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nThe SSG assured the people that the state government would ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies would be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\nHe added that the people were not camped in a particular area but moving around the four LGAs and were harboured by residents of the communities, saying that security agencies would fish them out.\n\nThe government also said that five of the bandits who reportedly destroyed the MTN mast in Gamawa LGA in their bid to facilitate their nefarious activities had been arrested.\n\n\u201cSome bandits have been arrested for vandalising the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for an attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Security Council Reconvenes Today\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe council, which had met last Friday, could not conclude deliberations on the security position of the nation and had to adjourn till today to come with a holistic position on the security crisis.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting will hold at the Conference Hall of the First Lady by 10 am with Buhari presiding as usual.\n\nThose expected to attend the meeting include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\n\nOthers are: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Ishiaka Oladayo Amoo and the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Suspected herdsmen kill 17 in Benue\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nBandits who abducted some students of Greenfield University in Kaduna have threatened to kill the remaining ones still in captivity if their demand for ransom is not met by today.\n\nIn an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, one Sani Jalingo who claimed to be the leader of the abductors, warned that if the state government or parents of the students fail to pay a ransom of N100 million and provide them with 10 new Honda motorcycles by today, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nThis is coming as no fewer than 17 villagers were feared killed in a fresh attack by suspected herdsmen in Benue State.\n\nThe Kaduna students, numbering about 22, were abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm.\n\nThey were said to have demanded N800 million ransom for the release of the students.\n\nHowever, while negotiations were still ongoing, five of the students were killed.\n\nJalingo said 17 students, comprising 15 girls and two boys, were in his custody, including the grandson of the late Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris, whose name was given as Hamza.\n\nHe stated that the families of the abducted students had already paid N55 million, but they had spent the money to feed the students.\n\n\u201cYou are speaking with the abductors of Greenfield students. We heard the comments of the Kaduna State governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms.\n\n\u201cIf they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students,\u201d Jalingo was quoted as saying in the interview.\n\nHe said five of the abducted students were killed to prove that the state and the federal governments had failed.\n\nJalingo described himself as a \u201cfood seeker,\u201d when asked if he is a terrorist.\n\nHe also warned security agencies against planting trackers on the motorcycles, as his members don\u2019t go to towns, stressing that arresting them would be difficult.\n\nOne of the abducted students, Abigail Usman, also spoke during the telephone interview, calling on the government and parents to pay the ransom \u201cso that they will not kill us.\u201d\n\nKaduna State police spokesman, Mr. Mohammed Jalinge; and the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan did not respond to inquiries when contacted.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the university authorities were unsuccessful as the mobile phone of the registrar, Mr. Bashir Mohammed, was switched off.\n\nSuspected Herdsmen Kill 17 People in Benue\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 17 people were feared killed yesterday by suspected herdsmen in Tse Angbeghe Udam Aondoana and Agbanu Seghev/Ukuse in Gwer West Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Felicia Anor, who survived the attack, the herdsmen came through Akpachi in Otukpo Local Government Area and launched the attack on Tse Angbeghe, killing 15 people while 26 others sustained injuries.\n\nThe attackers also blocked the Naka Nagi Agagbe road killing two people on a motorcycle while four others were injured.\n\nThe attack prompted a peaceful protest in Naka town by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Gwer West Chapter.\n\nA pastor in the area, Mr. Sule Sunday, on behalf of the Christian community, expressed sadness over the persistent attack on the communities.\n\nHe called on the government to intervene. A resident pastor in the area, Rev. Shamange, urged security operatives to go after the attackers to disclaim the speculations that security agencies had compromised in their assignment.\n\nAn indigene of the local government and a journalist, Mr. Francis Ugbede, said the herdsmen had taken over seven council wards of Sengev , Gaagev/Tongev, Saghev/Ukusu, Tough Ateer/ Ijaha, Gaambe Ushin and Mbachohon Avihijme.\n\nHe called for increased security patrols in the local communities.\n\nMeanwhile, security personnel have been drafted to the area to prevent further attacks.\n\nAccording to the state Police PRO (DSP), Ms. Catherine Anene, the police are aware of the incident.\n\nShe, however, could not confirm the number of people killed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "One of the parents of the abducted students of Greenfield University in Kaduna State has pleaded with the Federal Government to rescue their children.\n\nThe parent, who spoke with SaharaReporters on Tuesday said the release of the students will increase the faith of the students and their parents in Nigeria.\n\nTwenty-two students and a member of staff of the institution were abducted from the school campus along the Kaduna-Abuja highway on April 20 and within a week, five of them were killed.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Hausa Service of Voice of America (VOA), a leader of the bandit group who identified himself as Sani Idris Jalingo, threatened that if the Kaduna State Government or their families failed to pay a ransom of N100 million as well as provide them with 10 brand Honda motorcycles by Tuesday, the remaining students would be killed.\n\nBut speaking on the condition of anonymity with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, the parent said, \u201cWe are pleading with the government to come to our aid. We know the stand of the Kaduna State government, not to negotiate with bandits but to provide security is the job of the Nigerian government, not even the state. Constitutionally, the federal government has the right to provide security.\n\n\u201cSo, when the governor of a state says he has no power, he is actually right. If you look at it the other way round, he has no control over the Army neither does he have control over the police but all those powers are exclusive to the Federal Government, so the Federal Government has to come up with measures and strategies that will deliver these children out of the kidnappers' hands whether it means negotiating with them or meeting their demands; it is not out of place.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that America had come to rescue only one citizen over here, we should take a cue from there because once citizens know that their country protects and secures them, it means the citizens will be loyal to the country but in times like this when we need the intervention of the government, if they don't help us, what that means is that those children and every other person will not have faith and confidence in the ability of the government to protect the citizens.\n\n\u201cWe are begging and pleading with the government, especially the Federal Government to help us. We have done our best, what they are demanding is huge. We are calling on the Federal Government, let them come in, negotiate with the bandits. All we want is that our children should come back. It is so important to us because our children are our future and they are also the future of this country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of the bandit who surfaced in a video yesterday, said there were 17 students in their custody, comprising 15 female and two male students.\n\nIt was learnt that one of them is a grandchild of the late 18th Emir of Zazzau, Shehu Idris, whom he identified as Hamza.\n\nThe bandit revealed that the families of the students had already raised and paid N55 million to them but he added that they had used the money to feed the students.\n\nHe vowed that it was his final warning and should the government or the students\u2019 families fail to meet their demands, all the students would be killed.\n\n\u201cYou are speaking with the abductors of Greenfield students. We heard the utterances of the Kaduna State Governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he sees himself as a terrorist, Jalingo laughed and said: \u201cI\u2019m not but a food seeker.\u201d\n\nEmphasising his threat, the bandit said: \u201cIf they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students.\u201d\n\nHe warned security agencies not to waste their time planting trackers on the motorcycles, saying his members do not go to cities and therefore arresting them will be difficult.",

          "text": "A bill seeking to increase the number of justices of the court of appeal has passed second reading at the house of representatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bill seeks to amend the court of appeal act, cap C36, to increase the number of appeal court justices and \u201cprovide for appointment of a minimum of six justices in every judicial division of the court for speedy and efficient justice delivery\u201d.\n\nSection 1 of the proposed amendment seeks to increase the total number of the justices of the court from \u201c90 to a minimum of 150 justices in line with current realities\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the house on Tuesday, Onofiok Luke, lawmaker from Akwa Ibom and sponsor of the bill, explained that the number of justices in each judicial division is inadequate as a result of the increasing number of court cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe court of appeal is the intermediate court between the high court (including other subordinate courts and tribunals) and the supreme court. Established in 1976, the court had only three judicial divisions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe divisions of the court have now grown to 20. Some of the new divisions were commissioned in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe law pegs the maximum number of justices of the court at 90. This number has become inadequate given the recent creation of the new divisions of the court \u2013 Kano, Gombe, Awka, Asaba, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a high increase in the volume of cases attended to by the court, which has necessitated the creation of the new divisions. This implies increased workload with fewer hands, which therefore affects quick justice dispensation at the appellate level.\n\n\u201cMost of the divisions of the court do not have up to six justices, implying that two panels of the court cannot sit simultaneously to attend to cases, which therefore stalls expeditious and timely hearing and disposition of cases.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, judicial divisions of the court with huge volume of cases like Abuja and Lagos ought to have a minimum of nine justices, so that the divisions can have three panels sitting simultaneously.\u201d\n\nLuke said the delay in justice delivery in the appeal court is compounded because justices are drawn from the court to sit at election appeal tribunals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that the bill will \u201cincrease the quality of judicial decisions by making more hands available in adjudication process at the appellate level\u201d.\n\nLuke noted that the bill will also \u201cdecrease the workload on the shoulders of the justices of the appellate court and thereby extend their life expectancy\u201d.\n\nThe bill was passed for second reading after it was put to a voice vote by Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives.",

I think the ministry is not prepared for the Olympics and it\u2019s trying to avoid the wrath of Nigerians by inventing drama,\u201d the former minister had told TheCable.\n\nBut according to the statement, the affected boards claimed that the sports ministry lied about the expiration of their respective tenures.\n\nThe sports federations also condemned the establishment of caretaker committees, stating that such bodies wouldn\u2019t be recognised by international organizations.\n\n\u201cBoard members of the 31 Sports Federations met at the Presken Hotel, Abuja on Tuesday, May 4, 2021, and totally rejected the arbitrary and untimely dissolution of the boards of duly and democratically elected Federations,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe board members also condemned and rejected the establishment of caretaker committees over duly and democratically elected sports federations whose tenures were yet to expire.\n\n\u201cThe members unequivocally stated that on no account will the caretaker committees be recognized by the International bodies of the various sports federations in place of the duly elected boards.\n\n\u201cThe federations noted that the minister of youth and sports and the federal ministry of youth and sports development lied when they claimed that the tenures of the boards have expired board elections were held on June 13, 2017, and the inauguration into office was done on July 10, 2017, for a 4-year tenure The tenure will therefore expire on July 10, 2021, and not April 30, 2021 when the federations were dissolved.\n\n\u201cBoard members wish to Inform the public that no provision in the Code of Governance empowers the minister to dissolve Boards of duly and democratically elected federations and no legislation, law, regulation or instrument empowers the minister or the ministry of youth and sports development to set up caretaker committees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe minister and the federal ministry of youth and sports are urged to desist from jeopardizing the future of our youths especially Nigeria\u2019s sportsmen and women, by putting the country at risk of being banned from participating at the forthcoming Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\n\u201cThe board members restated that sports caretaker committees can never be allowed to replace duly elected boards whose tenures are yet to expire. lt also stated that it will do all in its power to stop autocracy in sports especially in a democratic dispensation.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fifth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

          "title": "Microtraction\u2019s novel approach to early-stage investments in Africa is paying off",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on conversations with investors in Africa \u2013 investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, private equities, venture capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nYele Bademosi didn\u2019t start out in the tech space. Being born to parents in the medical field, he attempted to toe that same line. When he gained admission to study medicine at King\u2019s College London, it seemed like his path had been charted, until a few years later when he dropped out. Medicine just wasn\u2019t his passion.\n\nAfter leaving medical school, he launched his first startup in the UK \u2013 Purple, a social app that let university students with shared interests in the UK find and connect with each other. After efforts to scale the social media app proved abortive, he shut down the project and flew back to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his return to Nigeria, he got a job as a general manager of Starta \u2013 an online community and resource platform for African startup entrepreneurs. He helped Starta reach over 24,000 subscribers in eight months before it was acquired in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, after developing a taste for helping startups get off the ground, he founded Microtraction, an early-stage venture capital fund that has gone on to invest in over 15 startups.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed Director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of crypto platform, Binance. He was charged with developing Africa\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. He held this role until April 2020.\n\nIn August 2019, he founded Bundle, a social payments app for cash and cryptocurrency.\n\nOur conversation began with trying to understand what spurred Badamosi to hop on the venture capital train earlier than most people.\n\nYele Bademosi: I think the ecosystem is a lot different today than it was five years ago when I initially began thinking about the idea for Microtraction (MT).\n\nFor context, I spent about nine months working with Dotun, who is also a VC at Novastar. One of the things that we were doing was trying to help entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses through knowledge and networks. I realized from that experience that it was difficult for founders to raise money.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t really have any other avenue if they didn\u2019t have a network or a rich relative. That was what really drove this idea. How do we create an easier way for founders to raise money?\n\nAnother thing was the incubation model, which was also popular in Nigeria at the time, wasn\u2019t really a good fit for the market. We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\n\nI wanted to find an alternative means to invest and support entrepreneurs. This birthed the MT model. This idea of an open application for funding with fixed check sizes without a program or a demo day was something that was unique at the time and MT was the first vehicle to do something like that.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What did Micro traction think was missing?\n\nYB: For us, it was more about streamlining. People went into a physical space with a batch of other companies and at the end, there was a demo day. That was the norm \u2013 the YC model. Interestingly, we raised capital from a bunch of limited partners, including Michael Siebel (YC\u2019s CEO).\n\nWe didn\u2019t do programs because we felt that the materials that were being taught weren\u2019t entirely applicable to Nigeria and Africa at large. We also felt that that drove up the costs of running this program. You would spend anything from 60-80% on programs and only deploy maybe 20%. So from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\n\nThe second critical part was the batch model. You can\u2019t predict the timeline of the creation of quality companies. We felt that when you invest in batches, you end up investing in companies that may not be ready to take on external capital yet, or might not be venture backable. What we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\n\nThe third thing was this idea of demo days. I\u2019ve been to a number of demo days. Some of them were very well prepared, presented, and executed, but when you looked at the amount of funding that was picked up by these companies, it was quite low.\n\nWe prefer investor intros, building networks of investors, connecting our founders to investors who will invest in them.\n\nSo those three things: No batches, no programs, no demo days. That\u2019s what made the MT model unique.\n\nThe Microtraction Team\n\nDA: Interesting, I always thought MT was like YC. So what does your support look like?\n\nYB: It varies, there are a bunch of partners now at MT. My strength really is in product and business strategy. Chidinma, one of our partners, is very strong at financial operations for business and governance. Dayo is an ex-founder, he is able to provide first-hand experience of getting a business off the ground and what not to do or do. Ife is probably one of the best recruiters in the world. Antonia is our communications chief. Each person brings a unique set of skills that can help our companies.\n\nI think one thing we always tell founders, and I believe now more than ever especially since I\u2019ve started a startup is that a founder is what makes a company successful. We actually believe that our job is not to make \u2018okay\u2019 founders good, but to find great founders and cut the red tape or barriers that hinder them from building great companies.\n\nWe have a ton of various individuals and companies that are able to help our companies across hiring, fundraising, talent, business strategy, growth, regulatory and PR. A rolodex that you can go to get support and grow your company is very key. Now as the number of portfolio companies continues to scale, we also have a network of founders who are working in complementary spaces and they can learn from each other and connect with each other and open up their networks to each other.\n\nDA: What does a day look like at MT?\n\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies. Obviously, we spend more time with companies we\u2019ve just invested in versus a company that has been in our portfolio for three years.\n\nWe are also very honest with ourselves. We are a pre-seed fund. Our biggest impact is when you\u2019re getting off the ground; just having a listening ear and being able to help you think through the decisions that you want to make as a business.\n\nAnd as founders/ex-founders there\u2019s a very high level of empathy. We spend maybe 20% of our time networking with other investors and other players in the space or non-investors just building your network because your network is your capital as an investor. That\u2019s how we help our companies recruit or raise the next round of capital. 20% or 25% is spent talking to companies in our pipeline. The last 55% is spent on our portfolio companies.\n\nMT Partners, Dayo koleowo and Chidinma Iwueke\n\nDA: MT has a bias to invest in startups with technical founders/co-founders, why?\n\nYB: I think that really comes from my own experience as a founder. When I started my first company right out of leaving medical school, I tried without a technical founder and it was incredibly difficult.\n\nI raised money and spent money on outsourcing. Actually, I think I was fortunate with the developer I got because he actually built the product, but it took a long time because it wasn\u2019t the only thing he was working on. And it cost a lot of money. When I needed to make changes, I didn\u2019t have the capital to make the changes and I was extremely slow. It took about six, seven months to get to market.\n\nWhile this was going on, I had a friend in the UK who we used to build stuff together. He was technical, I was a product designer. We would have an idea on Thursday, meetup on Friday or Saturday, by Sunday evening we built something and it was on Play Store and App Store. It really confirmed to me the importance of having people on the team who have some kind of technical skill, because at the end of the day what gives a startup a high valuation is growth and what gives you the leverage for growth is the fact that your business is either software-based or tech-enabled in some way.\n\nIf we give you money and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders. We\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\n\nDA: MT offers only $25,000 for 7% equity to every company, why?\n\nYB: Essentially, it is more around standardisation. If we had to negotiate every single deal that we were going into, then it would be quite challenging. We\u2019re having numerous conversations because every investment we make, we\u2019re talking to another five or six companies. That\u2019s even at the investment committee level, at the second or third phone call or team call it\u2019s another 20 companies for every single investment. We think it\u2019s fair for these companies with little or no revenue but we also review our deal structure from time to time.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your due diligence process like and what\u2019s the time frame?\n\nYB: We have a due diligence checklist, essentially a lot of which is more around governance. Governance because we invest early in these companies, we make sure that the company has the right documents and structure to make them investible. We literally spend a lot of time actually getting documents like incorporation, founder vesting agreements, also reference calls \u2013 just things that show the company has good governance.\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of the areas that I think we can actually improve upon, which is saying, how much should you and can you fund an early-stage company that has not been in existence for a very long time. There are some that are less than a week because the company is prepared or usually it takes weeks, it depends on how prepared the company is.\n\nDayo Koleowo at TechCabal\u2019s Edtech Townhall\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nYB: When I think of what will make me not invest in this company, the first thing is market opportunity. How big can this business be? Venture capital is extremely skewed. It\u2019s really about maximum upside as opposed to protecting your downside. What I mean by that is when we invest in companies we try to project the best possible outcome for the company.\n\nSo if the maximum upside is still looking like a small company, then we won\u2019t invest. That\u2019s probably why we say no to the vast majority of companies.\n\nNumber two is the progress made over time. I ask myself, am I impressed with how fast the company has moved within a particular time period? For a lot of companies, their progress over time isn\u2019t impressive especially when there are other companies to benchmark in that space.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the team. How good is the team? I don\u2019t do this as much anymore, but when I first started, I used to ask myself a question \u2018would I work for this founder?\u2019\n\nIf I had just moved back, starting off my career in the Nigerian or African tech ecosystem, and I saw this company, would I want to join them? Obviously, after five years, it\u2019s not the same so I can\u2019t really use that same benchmark because things are a lot different. But I still ask would I love to work for this founder? A lot of times when the answer is yes, the team is usually very strong.\n\nThe intersection of team, market and progress over time is what we look at. When a company fails those things, I\u2019m typically not interested in investing.\n\nDA: How has Covid-19 affected MT?\n\nYB: We actually continued investing during the pandemic. COVID had a bigger effect on startups than investors because investors have already collected money upfront. As an investor, you\u2019re not directly affected, it will affect your portfolio companies. I think COVID-19 impacted the quantity and quality of deal flow \u2013 the rate at which we receive investment offers.\n\nDA: Any exits from your end?\n\nYB: At MT, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to exit some of our positions, but we\u2019ve not taken those offers primarily because we still believe that there are significant opportunities for these companies to grow. The beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments. Most people when they hear exits they think about exits like the Paystack exit but the less popular/more common exit is usually a secondary exit where an investor exits or sells some of its shares to an existing investor or incoming investor. What we\u2019ll learn with this ecosystem is that exits are just a matter of time and we\u2019ll definitely see more exits in the future.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the tech space?\n\nYB: We\u2019re going to see a lot of investments going into fintech. I think we are going to see larger rounds coming into the industry. They\u2019ll stimulate a lot more stuff up in crypto, but they will move beyond the exchanges. I think crypto will probably be the second or at least in the top five sectors. Recently, I was looking at deals I did at Binance labs. I think from a fundraising perspective those deals probably outperformed any group of recent investments given the time that they took to raise over a million within a year to 18 months.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see some innovations in real money gaming, not just sports betting, but through playing games where you can win/ lose some money or some prizes.\n\nI think there\u2019ll be some moves in what I call export services, or export software services, which are essentially entrepreneurs that build products offered to global markets. I would definitely love to invest in anyone that is building anything around those ideas \u2013 crypto, gaming and export services.",
          "summary": "We hadn\u2019t seen any program that had a portfolio of companies that raised significant amounts of capital and the businesses scaled.\nSo from an operational efficiency standpoint, it wasn\u2019t really capital efficient.\nWhat we\u2019ve done with MT is to invest in companies on a one-on-one basis, and also to create a community around our companies.\nYB: There are a lot of meetings across potential companies, pipeline companies and our portfolio companies.\nThe beauty of the MT Fund is that we are not under any pressure to exit any of these investments.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government recently announced a partnership with tech giant Microsoft to accelerate the country\u2019s digital economy. This announcement follows a discussion that took place in January between Nigeria\u2019s vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo and Microsoft\u2019s Corporation President, Brad Smith.\n\nThe collaboration is in line with Nigeria\u2019s economic sustainable plan to grow the economy. It will foster job opportunities and upskill up to five million people in Nigeria, creating over 27,000 new digital jobs in the next three years.\n\nIn a statement by Microsoft, they are setting a \u201cbig goal to bring access to digital skills to five million people in Nigeria over the next three years. But this is not something we can do by ourselves. We will equip master trainers and, along with them, are committed to creating thousands of new jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we have an enormous opportunity to put technology to work, create jobs, to foster the technology ecosystem across Nigeria, and to use technology to preserve the best of the past and take us into the future.\u201d\n\nAs seen on Microsoft\u2019s website, each of Nigeria\u2019s six geo-political zones will have access to high-speed internet infrastructure courtesy of the digital transformation plan.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Airband team will work closely with local partners to improve broadband connectivity in these communities while also assisting with the design and implementation of hyper-scale cloud services.\u201d\n\nOn their end, the Nigerian presidency believes that Microsoft\u2019s extensive experience with using technology as an enabler for public and social good makes them an ideal partner.\n\nThis collaboration will focus on three major areas of development. Connectivity, skilling and digital transformation. Microsoft says after extensive consultation with the Nigerian government, they identified these three areas as key pillars to building strong foundations for a digital economy in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft partnered with IT firm Tek Experts, to create a Customer Support Centre in Lagos. The centre, according to them, employs over 1,600 people. This new digital initiative is another opportunity the tech company has to broaden their investment even more in Nigeria.\n\nBrad Smith said in a tweet that the company believes in the future of Nigeria and that they are excited about this partnership.\n\nThe initiative will also help protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural heritage. Microsoft will deploy artificial intelligence tools to protect Nigeria\u2019s cultural treasures for generations to come. They will do this alongside the National Institute of Cultural Orientation to revive and preserve the country\u2019s three major indigenous languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.\n\n\u201cThis is one of my favourite projects that we pursue around the world. It uses the most advanced technology of the 21st century to nurture and keep alive the culture that has been so important for humanity from the centuries past,\u201d Brad says.",

Vision impairment poses a significant global financial burden with the associated annual productivity losses estimated to be over $25.4 billion. The leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.\n\nSTRAP has developed a range of hardware and software solutions that address the mobility challenges that the blind and visually impaired encounter daily. After years of R&D and extensive testing, STRAP has integrated its solutions into a lightweight, chest-worn device that guides the blind and visually impaired by calculating the proximity of physical environments, allowing them to move unaided. This hands-free wearable harness uses haptic language to warn of hazards like an oncoming passer-by, walls, steps, and even changing elevations on sidewalks and other pathways. The company has received significant pre-orders from over 6,000 customers across North & Latin America and will ship its devices in Q4 2021. For a video overview of STRAP\u2019s technology in action, click here.\n\nThe company is also backed by International Accelerator and a group of Angel Investors. As part of Platform Capital\u2019s investment, Dr. Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Platform Capital, joins the Board of STRAP.\n\nDiego Roel, Founder and CEO of STRAP Technologies said \u201cSTRAP is the first assistive technology on the market that replaces the white cane that\u2019s been in use for over 100 years. I am inspired and excited by this recent investment and support in what STRAP is doing. The investment represents the belief in what we have accomplished and what we have been passionately working on these last three years in research and development. We appreciate the confidence of our investors in STRAP and strengthening our position for the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Ponmile Osibo, Partner at Platform Capital said \u201cWe are proud to partner with STRAP Technologies. Their innovative solution provides an exciting alternative for the white cane. We believe that this technology will impact millions of lives globally. We look forward to working with the STRAP team to scale and to ensure that visually impaired people can live dignified & independent lives without guides or the white cane.\u201d\n\nAbout STRAP Technologies\n\nSTRAP Technologies mission is to bring increased independence and autonomy to the visually impaired through the development of the world\u2019s first substitute for the white cane. Their featured product, STRAP, is a state-of-the-art wearable device that enables blind and visually impaired people to detect and respond to any type of obstacle and notify them of possible collisions.\n\nThe device is now available for pre-order with a limited promotional price of $500 USD. With a $50 USD deposit now, the remainder is due prior to shipping later this year.\n\nwww.strap.tech\n\nAbout Platform Capital\n\nPlatform Capital is a growth markets focused, sector agnostic, principal investment and advisory firm. We deploy patient, value accretive capital alongside international and local value investors to create champion businesses with the potential for regional or global scale.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s main opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has blamed the growing agitation for secession in different parts of the country on what it called government of exclusion practiced by the President Muhammadu Buhari led All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nThe party said the APC government\u2019s perfunctory management of Nigeria\u2019s diversity, has heightened feelings that the government has an ethnic agenda, as every action of this administration goes to confirm the fears of the victims and legitimises the agitations of the separatist groups.\n\nNational chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus who said this in his speech at the party\u2019s stakeholders meeting in Abuja on Monday, regretted that instead of engaging Nigerians, the administration resorts to harassment and intimidation of voices of dissent.\n\nSecondus noted particularly that \u201cAll calls and entreaties on the Federal Government to accommodate the South East in the headship of the nation\u2019s armed forces and security agencies have fallen on deaf ears to the chagrin of nation-building.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call on the APC-led government to live up to the spirit and letters of our constitution to ensure that all sections of the country are equitably represented in all agencies and organs of government, including the armed forces. This will build loyalty and enhance security both in strategic and real terms. It will give every part of the country a sense of belonging and will be very helpful in intelligence gathering.\u201d\n\nThe party chairman expressed disappointment that President Muhammadu Buhari has not deemed it fit to address Nigerians over the deteriorating security situation.\n\nThe party recommend the creation of state police, upscaling of the personnel strength of the arm forces, and the creation of a National border protection force different from the existing immigration and customs to check the influx of armed criminal gangs.\n\nAlso at the briefing, one of the leaders of the party, Bukola Saraki emphasised that the party will continue to put pressure on President Buhari\u2019s administration through constitutional means to demand that Nigeria is salvaged from the current security crises.\n\nRead Secondus\u2019 full speed below:\n\nFULL TEXT OF A WORLD PRESS CONFERENCE ON THE STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESSED BY THE NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF THE PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC PARTY, PRINCE UCHE SECONDUS, AT THE NATIONAL SECRETARIAT, ABUJA ON MAY 3, 2021.\n\nNIGERIA MUST NOT FAIL\n\nFollowing series of meetings in the last one week by various organs of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 the National Working Committee (NWC), the National Caucus, the Board of Trustees, and the National Executive Committee \u2013 the PDP as a political party, has come to the conclusion that the ship of state is adrift and requires help.\n\nWe have therefore called this world press conference to brief you and share with you the outcome of our deliberations.\n\nTHE STATE OF OUR NATION\n\nAs the wise saying goes, the goat does not suffer parturition in tethers while the elders are at home. Thus, the leadership of the PDP come to you today with a very heavy heart regarding the state of our union. It is very clear that Nigeria is on the precipice with arms-bearing non-state actors menacingly overrunning our state and its institutions and daily eroding our sovereignty.\n\nThese perilous situations have manifested through terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, arson, and inexplicable murderous rampage across our nation. The government\u2019s monopoly over legitimate coercive powers has been compromised and torpedoed, with criminal gangs let loose across our nation.\n\nIt is unimaginable that terrorists, who had been pushed out to the fringes by the President Goodluck Jonathan administration, leading to the successful elections of 2015, have since boldly reasserted themselves and are now taking territories in five local governments of Niger State, which is only two hours from Abuja. It is also important to note that the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, who by his position, is armed with credible intelligence, raised the alarm that terrorists and bandits were making inroads into the towns in Kaduna state. Also, noteworthy is the alarm raised by the Governor of Nasarawa State, Engr. Sule Abdullhahi, that the Boko Haram were occupying territories in his State. A strategic and intelligent interpretation of these is that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is surrounded.\n\nPresently, the nation has witnessed an upsurge of kidnapping in the FCT, further giving vent to the assertions of the Governors.\n\nIn addition to this, is the escalation of killings, arson, bloodletting, and kidnappings of Nigerians, including our men and women in uniforms across the nation.\n\nBetween January and now, no fewer than 741 Nigerians have been murdered by bandits and terrorists; dozens of police formations and security checkpoints, have been attacked, leaving scores dead. An attack on a correctional facility in Owerri, Imo State, led to the release of 1,844 inmates.\n\nFurthermore, from the kidnap of 110 Dapchi schoolgirls to the kidnap of 344 students from Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State, kidnap of 42 travelers between Kotangora and Minna, Niger State; abduction of another 27 students in Niger State; kidnap of about 300 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara State; abduction in March this year of about 30 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna, who are still being held in captivity; and the abduction of the students of the Greenfield University, who were intermittently slain without any response from the government. Nigeria has become an expansive field of mass kidnapping and murder under the watch of the APC-led Federal Government.\n\nTHE ECONOMY\n\nThis government has been completely rudderless regarding the economy. We remember that prior to the emergence of this administration, Nigeria\u2019s debt profile stood at less than $9.4 billion, (N1.8 trillion) having benefitted from the efforts of a previous PDP administration led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo for a debt relief of over $18 billion. Presently, Nigeria\u2019s debt burden has since risen to N32.9 trillion. It is curious that the only economic management tool known by this government is just mind-boggling borrowing. This includes borrowing for recurrent expenditure as well as for consumption.\n\nThe incompetence and absence of a clear policy for the economy is fast leading us into the woods of insolvency, which was recently confirmed by NNPC\u2019s confession that it would not be able to make remittances to FAAC for the month of April as well as the confusing response of government regarding the appropriate use of Ways and Means (printing money) to address our mounting economic challenges.\n\nIt is also very clear that despite the whimsical closure and reopening of borders, the supposed consumption of the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) alone has increased from about 30 million litres in 2015 to over 60 million liters even when the production capacity of the economy has seriously diminished. Many companies and businesses have dumped Nigeria for neighbouring countries because of an apparent inclement operational environment. Therefore, your guess is as good as ours as to whether the subsidy is for us, the citizens, or for the pockets of privileged few in government.\n\nFurther source of worry is the exchange rate that was at N180 to a dollar in 2014, now stands at nearly N500 to a dollar contrary to the APC\u2019s propaganda-laden promise of matching a dollar to one naira.\n\nInflation has been on the rise. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the consumer price index, which measures inflation increased, stood at 18.17 per cent (year-on-year) in March 2021. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the world; and while one of the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals is to end extreme poverty by 2050, APC has continued to lead the nation in the opposite direction. With over 86.9 million citizens living in extreme poverty, Nigeria overtook India as the poverty of the world in 2018, according to the Washington-based Brookings Institution. Nigeria\u2019s corruption rating has been consistently worse under the APC-led administration.\n\nThese and more clearly shows that the APC-led government has left the economy more than 100 per cent worse than they met it.\n\nMISMANAGEMENT OF THE NATION\u2019S DIVERSITY AND THE REFUSAL TO ENGAGE\n\nIn its formation, character, modus operandi, and belief in the eternal destiny of this country to succeed, the PDP, while not claiming perfection, has always taken deliberate steps to engage Nigerians and take constructive approach to nation-building. In this vein, the PDP in June 12, 2014 organised an all-party conference aimed at de-politicisation of the war against insurgency, which the incumbent President and Commander-in-Chief, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan as well as General Muhammadu Buhari (as he then was) attended.\n\nIn January 14, 2015, a peace accord was encouraged and endorsed by all political parties, which led to a successful 2015 election. The PDP also initiated a standing National Peace Committee, which is still in existence. And of course, the PDP initiated and successfully hosted the 2014 National Conference to deescalate tension and chart a trajectory for the social, economic, and political stability and prosperity for our nation.\n\nHaving done all these, we are worried that the APC government, in its character, formation, and modus operandi, has successfully mismanaged our diversity. It is clear that the core philosophy of the APC is to run a government of exclusion. They do not constructively engage Nigerians, except for erratic statements by Malam Garba Shehu, which further fans the embers of disaffection. Its sheer arrogance coupled with an aloof President is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIncreasingly, Mr. President is absent from duty. The symbol of authority of the Executive is simply not there, leading to various centres of power in the Executive, which affect the economy, security and manifest in lack of coordination and synergy in government operation.\n\nThe apparent nepotism in the appointment of the top echelon of the security forces, and the commanding heights of the institutions of government further fuel agitations across the country. In fact, winning elections has been reduced by the APC to more of sharing the spoils of war than running a government to the benefit of all citizens. This could be the only discernable reason for the President to appoint and still retains, as a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that has access to the sensitive data of Nigerians, a self-confessed bigot, who had voluntarily expressed happiness at the killing of people of other faith. It is also curious that such an individual like Isa Pantami, scaled through the vetting by Department of State Security (DSS) ahead of confirmation by the Senate.\n\nGranted that he may have changed in his views, is it possible that millions of youth radicalised by his preaching have also repented from extreme views and concomitant violent conducts? The PDP holds that our present circumstance is attributable to Dr. Isa Pantami and people who share and preach his views.\n\nThe very first step is for Pantami to be immediately relieved of his office and handed over for investigation, and if found wanting, he should be prosecuted.\n\nTHE WAY FORWARD\n\nDear compatriots, we come to you today to reassert our confidence in the future of our union, cognisant of the spirit and letters of our Constitution, and believing that we are all better together; that we are one nation under God, determined to build a formidable nation-state. We have not come to play politics, but to work in concert with our compatriots to rescue of our nation from these avoidable perilous circumstances.\n\nCOMBATING INSECURITY\n\nWe therefore:\n\n1. Demand for the immediate up-scaling of the personnel strength of our men and women in uniform and make adequate provisions of kinetic instruments of war and law enforcement. Our armed forces should be adequately equipped and their welfare a top priority.\n\nIn addition, efforts should be made towards partnership with foreign governments and miscellaneous entities for the war efforts. The situation in our country is not normal and exceptional steps should be taken to restore it to normalcy. The PDP, as a body, is willing to give a helping hand in this direction.\n\n2. Call for the establishment of a State Police: We call on all citizens to support the quest for state police as is the tradition in other federations. Mindful of the current plethora of vigilante in various parts of the country, which have not been enabled to carry out all the elements of effective policing, we call on the governors of the 36 states, the leadership and members of the National Assembly, the Speakers of the State Assemblies, relevant agencies of government, to occasion a summit for a one-stop-shop regarding the creation, structure, and management of state police. In spite of the concerns over state police, it is doubtful that 36 state police services can be easily overwhelmed, as is the case now with the unitary police. Besides, any challenges can be addressed through legislative framework to make abuse extremely difficult, if not impossible.\n\n3. We also call for the deployment of technology in the fight against terror, banditry, and other crimes. The PDP demands that all culprits should be brought to book. The apparent failure of intelligence to track attacks by bandits and follow up on them is a clear failure of the intelligence community. The Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited NIGCOMSAT, established many years ago by a PDP administration, is designed for this purpose and others.\n\n4. States where matters of national security challenges originate or exist should be invited to the National Security Council Meeting for deliberation and problem-solving interactions.\n\n5. We call for the creation of National Borders Protection Force to secure our borders. This will include an integrated border protection system that will draw personnel and equipment from existing armed service and Immigration\n\nWe cannot continue to watch while terrorists and bandits continue to levy war on our nation, through our porous borders. This borders force should be equipped with reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, prevention, and enforcement. It should therefore have air, sea, and land capability.\n\n6. There must be a synergy and cooperation among the armed services, strategically and operationally. There is no reason a theatre Commander should not have within his control the deployment of the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy in his operational area.\n\n7. All culprits, who have levied war on Nigeria, should be brought to book. It is unfathomable that several mass kidnappings have been successfully staged with the culprits not being held to account. It is a shameful irony that a few bandit leaders that have been taken out were killed by rival gangs and not our security agencies.\n\nIf Sheik Gumi could detect and engage the bandits, we do not understand why our security agencies cannot track, arrest, and prosecute them.\n\n8. The administration of President Buhari should completely shed weight on arrogance, lack of respect for Nigerians, and its pretences of being an island of integrity.\n\nHe should begin to engage the citizens directly. He should address the nation on the various issues escalating tension in the land and pushing the nation farther to the tips of the precipice.\n\nIt is serious political malpractice, for Mr. President to stand aloof, say nothing, do nothing and simply wish that the problems will somehow go away. It is a great disservice to the Nigerian people for Mr. President to abandon his presidential duties to two media handlers who resort to issuing meaningless and annoying PRESS STATEMENTS in the name of an amorphous and questionable organisation called \u201cTHE PRESIDENCY\u201d. Enough of trivialising governance and trifling with the lives, livelihoods and wellbeing of the Nigerian people.\n\nFurthermore, Mr President needs to convince Nigerians that his government is not shielding or protecting terrorists.\n\nRESCUING THE ECONOMY\n\n1. We hold that our government should stop borrowing. Our future generations are being mortgaged and railroaded into avoidable debt trap. APC should do away with their nepotism and hire experts that will help creatively navigate the nation through the dire economic challenges they have led the nation into.\n\n2. We also believe that the management of the economy, including the management of Ways and Means should be done in a more professional manner to avert a collapse of the economy. The country is bleeding economically and the operations of the NNPC must be investigated and oversighted by the parliament. The topsy-turvy situation where Mr. President, who is the Minister of Petroleum, approves oil wells only to reverse himself in a matter of weeks as demonstrated in the case of Addax and Kaztech/Slavic consortium (OMLs 123, 124, 126 and 137) and others like that should be investigated.\n\nTURNING THE PAGE ON DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT\n\n1. The tension and current separatist agitations threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria owe their origins to the perfunctory management of diversity by the APC-led Federal Government, as every action of this administration goes to confirm the fears of the victims and legitimises the agitations of the separatist groups.\n\nWorse still, instead of engaging Nigerians, this administration resorts to harassment and intimidation of voices of dissent. They clamp down on democratic expressions against exclusion as well as political opposition, weaponising critical institutions like the armed forces, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), and even regulatory agencies like the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), etc.\n\nEven an appearance on national television or radio could warrant a clampdown by NBC or an invitation by the EFCC or ICPC. We fear that this, if not checked, could soon graduate to the assassination of political opponents and voices of dissent.\n\nAll calls and entreaties on the Federal Government to accommodate the South East in the headship of the nation\u2019s armed forces and security agencies have fallen on deaf ears to the chagrin of nation-building.\n\nTherefore, we call on the APC-led government to live up to the spirit and letters of our constitution to ensure that all sections of the country are equitably represented in all agencies and organs of government, including the armed forces. This will build loyalty and enhance security both in strategic and real terms. It will give every part of the country a sense of belonging and will be very helpful in intelligence gathering.\n\nAs known the world over, no victim of injustice is ever interested in peace. In this wise, we strongly subscribe to an all stakeholders Security and Solution Summit that will deescalate the current situation. This will now further collaborate the efforts of the leaders of the National Assembly, the state governors, Speakers of Assemblies, and relevant government agencies and other stakeholders in putting together a one-stop summit to find solutions to the menacing security situation in the country.\n\nDEVOLUTION OF POWERS\n\nWe call for the devolution of more powers to the states and local governments. From our experience since the first military regime in 1966, the Federal Government has increasingly bitten more than it can chew and the nation is crumbling under the weight of a behemoth Federal Government. Items like Railway, Aviation, Power, Police, among others, should immediately devolve to trigger productivity and creative leadership that will enable the constituent parts to develop. Such new responsibilities should also come with consequential increment in the resources available to the states.\n\nELECTORAL ACT\n\nIt is worrisome that the report of the National Assembly Joint Committee on INEC, which finished its work since February 2021 is yet to be laid in the two chambers of the National Assembly. We are aware that the work of the Committee, which also benefitted from the Joint Technical Committee on the Repeal and Re-enactment of the Electoral Act comprising select members of the National Assembly, INEC, the Civil Society, and other experts made far-reaching recommendations that would benefit our electoral system and democracy. This includes early primaries, such that if approved by the National Assembly and signed by the President, INEC is expected to call for nominations in February 2022, while political parties will have until July 2022 to conduct primaries and submit a list of their candidates.\n\nImportantly, we understand that the report comprises proposals for extensive use of technology in our elections, including electronic transmission of results.\n\nThese are critical moves at repositioning our elections by allowing INEC enough time to prepare for elections and reduce the logistical challenges; allow political parties enough time to conduct primaries and handle the contestations, and reduce election malpractices that occur during result collation.\n\nWe are therefore alarmed at the decision of the APC-led leadership of the National Assembly to sit on such an important report, contrary to their promise to pass the Electoral Act by March, which has now been shifted to June. It is imperative to state that INEC and the government of the United Kingdom have equally raised concerns over these undue delays, as it appears this current amendment is going the way of the Electoral Act amendment in the 8th National Assembly that was ultimately not signed by Mr. President.\n\nWe, therefore, invite well-meaning Nigerians, the international community, the CSOs and stakeholders to apply pressure on the leadership of the National Assembly, President Muhammadu Buhari, and the APC to immediately have the report laid, considered, passed, and signed by President Buhari.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGentlemen of the press, with the tension in the land, it is very clear to us that leadership is made of sterner stuff, not propaganda. From every indication, from the actions and body language of the APC-led administration, it is very clear that there is a mission to deconstruct our country, Nigeria. All men and women of goodwill must not allow this to happen.\n\nWe are supremely confident in the words of John Maxwell that some people, in this case, the APC and this administration, could stop the nation and set us back temporarily, but we, the citizens, are the only ones that can stop ourselves permanently.\n\nWe, therefore, believe in the manifest destiny of this nation to succeed because we are one nation under God. But all hands must be on deck. Let us come together and pull the nation from the brink. It is time for all Nigerians to stand up and be counted as we commence the journey to rescue our nation from the current misrule by the APC.\n\nThe commitment of the PDP to the Nigerian people is to lead the charge towards the restoration of normalcy to the Federal Republic of Nigeria. PDP will be engaging the international community and friends of Nigeria regarding the volatile situation in Nigeria. We hope they will lend their voices henceforth, knowing the implications of an implosion of Nigeria, God forbids, for the rest of the world. But on the whole, the penchant to emasculate, muscle, and intimidate opposition figures will not deter us from this noble cause.\n\nGod bless Nigeria.\n\nThank you.\n\nPrince Uche Secondus\n\nNational Chairman",

          "text": "By Jonathan Nda-Isaiah\n\nFormer governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has assured that a new Nigeria that will accommodate the aspirations of all the federating units, where peace and justice will prevail, can still be achieved through the enthronement of a people-oriented leadership.\n\nOkorocha disclosed this to selected journalists in Abuja, to mark this year\u2019s workers\u2019 day celebration.\n\nThe ex-Imo governor, who is also the Senator representing Imo West, enjoined Nigerians not to despair but remain resolute and committed to a united Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the dormant potentials of the country will be activated for public good under a new Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, what the country is currently going through in terms of insecurity, hunger, poverty and unemployment, can be surmounted when Nigerians are inspired to believe in the Nigerian project.\n\nHe said that the Nigerian workers have made and continued to make great sacrifices in building a prosperous nation, but are yet to extract commensurate benefits.\n\nOkorocha, however, appealed to the workers to continue to exhibit the spirit of nationhood, by putting the unity and stability of the country first.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his words, \u201cwe should envision a new Nigeria where everyone will be accommodated irrespective of religion, ethnicity and social status, a Nigeria that will put the people first, where workers will be proud to work for their country. We can achieve this if we all remain resolute and committed to the ideals of a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI salute the doggedness of the Nigerian workers who have continued to make sacrifices without much in return. We should all be driven and motivated by the spirit of patriotism and the faith that a New Nigeria is about to birth.\u201d\n\nThe former governor also gave hints on how to tackle the heightening insecurity across the country, tasking the government to involve every region in finding lasting solution to the security challenges.\n\nHe solicited the involvement of every part of the country to evolve a plan of action.\n\nOkorocha maintained that though the government and security agencies, especially the Armed Forces of Nigeria, are making great sacrifices to restore peace, the people need to be on the same page.\n\nThe Senator added that injustice formed part of the remote causes of the prevailing insecurity and separatist agitations, stressing that until all perceived issues of marginalization are addressed, Nigerians may remain indifferent to the challenges.\n\nAccording to him, the political leadership of the country should give every Nigerian, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion or social status, a sense of belonging by making decisions that are all inclusive and designed to address the plight of the poor, adding that until the issues of poverty and hunger are resolved, criminality will continue to thrive.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria can overcome the current security challenges faster and stronger, if every region of the country is consulted and involved. The people we call bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and other criminals live among the people, they are shielded and treated as heroes and defenders,. because the people have the impression that they have been abandoned by the government.\n\n\u201cBut if this trend is reversed, if every Nigerian is given a sense of belonging, the spirit of patriotism will be ignited in everyone and they will stand by the government.\u201d",

          "text": "Directs agency to return confiscated items in 2 weeks\n\nBY BODE GBADEBO, Abuja\n\nThe Senate Committee on Ethics and Public Petitions on Tuesday decried the invasion of the popular Oja Oba and Bodija markets in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital by operatives of the Nigeria Customs Services (NCS).\n\nThe NCS officers had last week invaded the Oja Oba market and carted away eight truckloads of rice and money found in the shops of the affected traders.\n\nThe operation was carried out after a month when the operatives had raided Bodija International Market, Ibadan, where they carted away bags of rice.\n\nThe Senate Committee in its resolutions urged the Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), represented by an Assitant Comptroller General, Garba Mohammmed, to ensure that the seized goods were returned to the affected traders within two weeks, their shops unlocked while money taken from the shops be equally returned to the owners.\n\nMembers of the Senate committee expressed reservations that the action of the NCS was a breach of the Customs Act and the Executive Order signed by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007, which empowers the agency to only impound smuggled goods, 40 kilometers radius to the border.\n\nChairman of the legislative committee, Senator Ayo Akinyelure, who recalled that a similar string operation carried out by the NCS in Katsina State led to the dismissal of the officer who led the operations while the confiscated goods were returned to the traders on the order of President Muhammadu Buhari, urged the Comptroller-General of Customs to extend the same gesture to the affected traders in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cWhy do you allow the goods to come in through the borders and they find their way to the market of innocent citizens?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese people are retailers, they don\u2019t have the capacity to import. There is no reasonable grounds for your people to go to the market in the thick of the night. The market isn\u2019t within 40km radius of the border. Some people gave you information and you didn\u2019t verify.\n\n\u201cThere is a precedence that this thing happened in Katsina and the officers were sacked. Is this the time to go and raid helpless women who borrowed money to do their business? You also took their money from their shops, you admitted. Is money also a contraband?\n\n\u201cYou should stop raiding markets and car shops. This committee is sending message to Hameed Ali (the CG) that the same thing happened in Katsina. We are appealing to the CG Customs to return the goods taken in Bodija and Oja Oba markets.\n\n\u201cThey should return those goods within 15 days. Tell the CG to unlock their shops so that they can continue to do their business. The market isn\u2019t within the 40km radius of the border.\n\n\u201cThe precedence that happened in Katsina and a directive came from above. So, if it happened in Katsina and Ibadan, the capital of south-west shouldn\u2019t be an exception.\n\n\u201cYou are heating up the polity, punishing innocent people. The real people who bring in the rice you know them. We are telling you to return their goods and money in two weeks. Whatever decision you take, you must come back to this committee. The rice and garri must be returned. You must also unlock their shops,\u201d Akiyelure said.\n\nFor his part, Senator representing Oyo South, Kola Balogun, said the Customs officers owed Nigerians an apology for the illegal raid.\n\n\u201cThe procedure is wrong. The Act says you can seal off the shops in the presence of the owners, not to go there in the night. If it happened in Katsina and the goods were returned, why can\u2019t we do similar thing in the case of Bodija? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\u201d Balogun added.\n\nThe representative of the Comptroller-General of Customs, Assistant Comptroller General, Garba Mohammmed, however, defended the action of the Customs officers in Ibadan.\n\nMohammed said the operation was done within the ambit of the law enacted by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said Section 147 of the Customs Act empowered Customs officers for the purpose of carrying out the powers given to police officers to search premises where there is ground to suspect that contraband were concealed, whether day or night.\n\n\u201cWe have the right to break windows or shops where there are reasonable grounds.\n\n\u201cThe seizure was based on intelligence gathering. We don\u2019t intend to put people out of business. The CG of Customs is a transparent person. The case of Katsina state, I don\u2019t know the circumstances. If it is foreign rice, I doubt if it would have been returned.\n\n\u201cWe are only implementing the laws, we don\u2019t make it. If we put people out of business, how are we going to make money. Our investigation is still going on,\u201d ACG Mohammed added.",

This is why most families globally crave for Catholic education through catholic schools for their children and wards, irrespective of their belief systems.\n\n\u201cThey may be Hindus, Atheists, Muslims, Buddhists or Christians of other denominations; Catholic schools as run by the likes of the Jesuits, the Dominicans, the SMA Father, St Patrick\u2019 missionaries, Spiritans, Franciscans, Vincentians congregations, Marist Brothers, Reverend Sisters of diverse Order, Catholic Diocesan and/Arch-diocesan Presbyteries; to mention but a few, attract a lot of patronage from people of diverse religious and belief systems.\n\n\u201cThis is also enhanced by the non-discriminatory practices, systems and policies of the Catholic Church in dispensing its social services or in the exercise of the Church\u2019s social teachings and responsibilities.\n\n\u201cCatholic education and civilization is attractive to both the poor and the rich globally; because of its richness and embodiment of values that make for the total man-modelled after the values propounded by Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cValues that have been tested and trusted over the ages and several centuries, which have stood the test of time. Education, that is relevant and impactful in all societies and in all circumstances; and imbues in its beneficiaries values of respect and dignity for the human person.\n\n\u201cProgressive, developed and modern civilizations have copied a lot from the Catholic values and civilization. The Catholic Church as the oldest institution in the world is a testimonial to its enduring virtues and values; and the reason, modern human institutions in the world admire to emulate it.\n\n\u201cThe staying power, values and modest virtues that beautify catholic education are certainly, diluted abstractions from the curriculum and formation handbook of the Catholic seminary.\n\n\u201cThe seminary is not a secondary school; it rather has secondary education as its integral part, it is much more than the usual secular post-primary institution. It is a nursery home, separated from the secular world for the formation of new human persons who will function as the light of world and a salt of the earth. A Day In The Seminary Is Never A Joke!\n\n\u201cIt is therefore necessary at this stage of Nigeria\u2019s social, political and economic history and development for those who were opportune and privileged to receive the seminary training to boldly come out and put to use their capacities, competences and character in favour of the larger Nigerian society and its people; just like Jesus Christ our Master admonished.\n\n\u201cYou are the light of the world. A city seated on a mountain cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house.\u201d",

          "text": "BY CHIKA CHIMEZIE\n\nFollowing the high rate of insecurity in different parts of the country, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Monday said his administration will stop at nothing to ensure that Lagos remains safe and secure for all.\n\nSpeaking at the 3rd Session of the 34th Synod of the Diocese of Lagos, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) held at Our Saviour\u2019s Anglican Church, Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu assured that Lagos will be a State that everybody would be proud of, adding that his administration will deliver on all the THEMES six-pillars developmental agenda for \u2018Greater Lagos.\u2019\n\nHe said: \u201cTalking about security, we can say Lagos is relatively better but I sit on it and I know what we are doing and the things we need to do. We know we have issues to deal with as a country and Lagos will certainly be leading that conversation because we know how critical this State is to the nation.\n\n\u201cThis is the melting pot for our nation where anybody can come in with a lot of aspirations and do well. Lagos is a state that gives hope to a lot of Nigerians. Lagos is a state that gives hope to all of Nigeria. So, we cannot afford anything to happen here. I can assure you with every sense of commitment that we will stop at nothing to make sure that Lagos remains safe and secure.\n\n\u201cIn this month of May, you will see extensive pronouncements in that regard. You will see extensive policies and far reaching support that would be given out to all our security operatives so that it is not just a talk show and film show; it is something we are committed to and we will continue to make sure that our Lagos remains safe, secure, prosperous and a place where all of you would truly be proud off.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on some of the measures being taken by his administration to curb insecurity in the state, Governor Sanwo-Olu said \u201cWe will deal with the issue of motorcycle in systematic order and to have human face to it, we would provide credible alternatives. We cannot throw the baby and the water away. The alternatives would be properly fashioned out before end of month of May.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu also appealed to citizens who have buildings that are either not completed or abandoned to get a professional security company to take it over so that they can monitor and police them well instead of leaving them open for criminals as hideouts.\n\nHe also spoke on some of the laudable achievements of his administration in the areas of transport, health, education, technology and security, among others.\n\nThe Governor, who said he is very proud to be a member of the Diocese of Lagos, commended the Bishop of Diocese of Lagos, Rt. Revd Humphrey Olumakaiye, for taking the diocese to a higher level.\n\nHe said Lagos State Government will support all of the infrastructure that will lead to the Centenary City of the Diocese because the city according to him is about the hope the diocese want to give to the hopeless and vulnerable parishioners.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, who donated N25million to support the synod, said the State Government would be supporting the hosting of the Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) coming up in September for all the delegates to have a first class experience in Lagos.\n\nIn his address, Bishop Olumakaiye commended Governor Sanwo-Olu for showing leadership and delivering dividends of democracy to Lagosians with the THEMES developmental agenda.\n\n\u201cYour assiduity, promptness and managerial skills in handling the much dreaded COVID-19 pandemic and other crises that hit the nation and the world at large deserve applause. We sincerely salute your doggedness and unparallel leadership that is driven with the purpose of making Lagos the centre of excellence in terms of security, tranquility, employability, improved livelihood and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier on behalf of about 73 bishops that attended the synod, former Archbishop of Lagos Province and former Dean, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), the Most. Revd. Ephraim Adebola Ademowo, also commended Governor Sanwo-Olu for taking Lagos State to a greater height.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "BY CHIKA CHIMEZIE\n\nFollowing the high rate of insecurity in different parts of the country, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Monday said his administration will stop at nothing to ensure that Lagos remains safe and secure for all.\n\nSpeaking at the 3rd Session of the 34th Synod of the Diocese of Lagos, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) held at Our Saviour\u2019s Anglican Church, Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu assured that Lagos will be a State that everybody would be proud of, adding that his administration will deliver on all the THEMES six-pillars developmental agenda for \u2018Greater Lagos.\u2019\n\nHe said: \u201cTalking about security, we can say Lagos is relatively better but I sit on it and I know what we are doing and the things we need to do. We know we have issues to deal with as a country and Lagos will certainly be leading that conversation because we know how critical this State is to the nation.\n\n\u201cThis is the melting pot for our nation where anybody can come in with a lot of aspirations and do well. Lagos is a state that gives hope to a lot of Nigerians. Lagos is a state that gives hope to all of Nigeria. So, we cannot afford anything to happen here. I can assure you with every sense of commitment that we will stop at nothing to make sure that Lagos remains safe and secure.\n\n\u201cIn this month of May, you will see extensive pronouncements in that regard. You will see extensive policies and far reaching support that would be given out to all our security operatives so that it is not just a talk show and film show; it is something we are committed to and we will continue to make sure that our Lagos remains safe, secure, prosperous and a place where all of you would truly be proud off.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on some of the measures being taken by his administration to curb insecurity in the state, Governor Sanwo-Olu said \u201cWe will deal with the issue of motorcycle in systematic order and to have human face to it, we would provide credible alternatives. We cannot throw the baby and the water away. The alternatives would be properly fashioned out before end of month of May.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu also appealed to citizens who have buildings that are either not completed or abandoned to get a professional security company to take it over so that they can monitor and police them well instead of leaving them open for criminals as hideouts.\n\nHe also spoke on some of the laudable achievements of his administration in the areas of transport, health, education, technology and security, among others.\n\nThe Governor, who said he is very proud to be a member of the Diocese of Lagos, commended the Bishop of Diocese of Lagos, Rt. Revd Humphrey Olumakaiye, for taking the diocese to a higher level.\n\nHe said Lagos State Government will support all of the infrastructure that will lead to the Centenary City of the Diocese because the city according to him is about the hope the diocese want to give to the hopeless and vulnerable parishioners.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, who donated N25million to support the synod, said the State Government would be supporting the hosting of the Standing Committee of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) coming up in September for all the delegates to have a first class experience in Lagos.\n\nIn his address, Bishop Olumakaiye commended Governor Sanwo-Olu for showing leadership and delivering dividends of democracy to Lagosians with the THEMES developmental agenda.\n\n\u201cYour assiduity, promptness and managerial skills in handling the much dreaded COVID-19 pandemic and other crises that hit the nation and the world at large deserve applause. We sincerely salute your doggedness and unparallel leadership that is driven with the purpose of making Lagos the centre of excellence in terms of security, tranquility, employability, improved livelihood and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier on behalf of about 73 bishops that attended the synod, former Archbishop of Lagos Province and former Dean, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), the Most. Revd. Ephraim Adebola Ademowo, also commended Governor Sanwo-Olu for taking Lagos State to a greater height.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

If we allow this culture of violence to go unchecked, such mobs would destroy law and order,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President urged leaders of ethnic and religious groups \u201cto play their own roles constructively in controlling their followers or members, in order to support the government\u2019s efforts for sustainable peace.\u201d\n\nBuhari cautioned Nigerians against the \u201ctemptations of taking the law into their hands in the name of revenge because there are no winners in the cycle of violence, only losers.\u201d\n\nThe President sent his commiserations to the families of the bereaved and the governments and people of Benue and Anambra States.\n\nHe also commended the police and other law enforcement agencies for their prompt response in averting the escalation of the violence, urging them to put in every effort to apprehend perpetrators of the heinous attacks.",

It is an autonomous State. Nobody in other State can come and tell us that we are with them, No.\n\n\u201cSo, I will not allow anybody to enter this State to tell us that we are part of them. We will do everything we can to protect the interest of our State.\n\n\u201cWe are a friendly people. We will allow anybody to come here and do business. But nobody should go beyond doing business to hoist unnecessary flag here. We will not take it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor advised Ekpeye people not to leave anything to chance anymore, but to be vigilant to know what happenped around and within their communities.\n\nHe urged them to report movements that they did not trust, that looked suspicious so that proper action could be taken to avert any possible attack.\n\n\u201cNigeria has collapsed. Security has also collapsed. There is no day you won\u2019t hear ten people have been killed, 20 people have been killed, 30 have been kidnapped.\n\n\u201cThere is no assurance of protection of life anymore.

          "text": "By Atiku Abubakar\n\nFormer Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has called the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to consider recalling retired military veterans in the battle against terrorism in the country.\n\nAtiku, in a statement on Tuesday lamented that the security situation in Nigeria was deteriorating rapidly and that ordinary Nigerians were living in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones.\n\n\u201cNowhere seems to be safe. Farms, markets, schools, homes, mosques, churches, and urban areas are all affected.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are spreading their areas of operation beyond the Northeast, into far flung areas as far as Niger State in the North-Central. That is merely hours from our Federal Capital.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for decisive leadership and I call on the Federal Government to consider recalling all ex-servicemen and women, who are willing to return to service, and take the fight to the insurgents, until they are rolled back and defeated,\u201d he said.\n\nAtiku said as a former vice chairman of the National Security Council, he was aware that Nigeria has a sizeable population of military veterans, who are alive, and were trained locally and internationally, and that it served no purpose to allow these valuable national assets lie fallow when there is an existential threat to the nation.\n\n\u201cCall them up. Immediately. Mobilise them to the field. The time has come for us to put in all our effort and stamp out this menace from our nation.\n\n\u201cThe men and women of Nigeria\u2019s armed forces, whether serving or retired, who restored peace to Lebanon, Liberia, Sierra Leone and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe can, and should be used to do the same in the motherland.\n\n\u201cBut they need arms and ammunition. It is incumbent on the federal government to develop a more efficient means of sourcing for weapons and delivering them to the troops at the battlefront.\n\n\u201cA situation where terrorists and criminals are better armed than our troops on the battlefront is intolerable,\u201d he stated.\n\nAtiku said the federal government needed to urgently improve the conditions of service of the men and women of the armed forces, saying that the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, working in concert with primary mortgage institutions, ought to offer the men and women of the armed forces special concessionary mortgage loans so they could own homes.\n\nHe said the private sector should also be encouraged to offer discounted services to them in appreciation of their services.\n\n\u201cThere is no sacrifice greater than to lay down your life for the motherland. When our military is properly rewarded, they will fight more valiantly and gallantly. A nation that rewards courage is one that avoids outrage,\u201d he said.",

Of course, such would attract the necessary consequences.\n\nThese discredited individuals and groups are also in cahoots with external forces to cause maximum damage in their own country.

          "text": "May 3, 2021 512\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.",

          "title": "Worsening Apapa Gridlock Amidst NPA Electronic Call-up System",
          "text": "April 29, 2021 522\n\nPort users, commuters and other motorists are currently groaning over the worsening gridlock on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway and along the Marine Bridge, Ijora, as trailers and tanker drivers have taken over these routes despite the implementation of the electronic call-up system by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock. Under the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\n\nHowever, two months into the implementation of the new system, there seems to be no end in sight to the intractable gridlock with NPA and Lagos State Government appearing helpless as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately on the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some truck drivers, due to the alleged slow process in booking of trucks by the Truck Transit Park (TTP), the company managing the eto application, have abandoned the designated parks to remain on the roads and bridges where they bribe their way into the port with fake e-call up slip in connivance with security personnel deployed to manage the gridlock.\n\nThe action by these truck drivers, coupled with the poor access roads and ongoing construction along the Mile Two-Tin Can Island Port road, has compounded the gridlock as motorists spent several hours trying to get into Apapa yesterday.\n\nAll the major roads into Apapa were completely taken over by trucks and petroleum tankers yesterday. The traffic stretched to other major highways including Eko Bridge and Ikorodu Road.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Directs NSCDC To Collaborate With Other Agencies To Prevent Attacks At Airports\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Stanley Ezenga, said there has not been any respite on the road despite the e-call up system, which he said has become a money-making venture for some people benefiting from the situation.\n\nHe said the traffic situation persists due to poor access roads and the failure of the government to prevail on the contractor handling the construction of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to expedite action.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature. The e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it. For each call up, trucks pay N10,000 but this is just the official money. They still part with other money being given to security operatives before they get to the port.\n\n\u201cSo who is fooling who? From the onset, I know there will be issues with the e-call up because the main issue that has to do with the gridlock coupled with the state of the road has not been addressed. You can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Navy, created a task force but the gridlock has negated all of them.

          "text": "April 29, 2021 419\n\nA week is a week. This is almost true in every part of the world regardless of the season. Every week is also unique. The activities, the happenings, and the stories define each week.\n\n*This week has been epoch-making in every sense. This week, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd. The verdict was unanimous. He was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for over 9mins. George in pleading for his life kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Philonise Floyd, George\u2019s brother said that he\u2019s \u201cable to breathe again\u201d.\n\nThe feeling of relief was widespread. It was a sigh of relief heard around the world. We can all breathe again.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government lifted the ban on sales of SIM cards.\n\nOfficially, it meant that the telcos could resume sales of SIM cards after months of suspension. The sector and indeed Nigerian telecom services consumers were able to breathe again.\n\nDuring the ban, countless people who had lost their phones or damaged their SIM cards couldn\u2019t retrieve them. Visitors to the country couldn\u2019t get SIMs and businesses that depended on SIM card sales suffered. Millions were thrown out of jobs, sales outlets shut down and operators lost revenue. The last five months were a real chokehold on the telecommunications industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Employment Statistics: World Bank, FG To Discuss Modalities Of Data Collection\n\nConservatives reports indicate that the number of connected lines dropped by over 10 million lines. Think, loss in revenue to the telecom services providers and endless pain for the customers who couldn\u2019t connect with family, friends, or business. It was a chokehold.\n\nNo wonder the sector couldn\u2019t breathe. Little wonder the economy recorded a rise in the number of unemployed and more citizens dropped into the poverty zone. The country couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nSince nature abhors a vacuum, it didn\u2019t take long for illegal sales of pre-registered SIMs to gain ground. This is a story for another week.\n\nThe biggest loss was that the objective was lost to all but the initiators. It was a chokehold on the economy, Nigerians couldn\u2019t breathe and nobody knew why.\n\nFirst, a little context. The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, had in December 2020 ordered the suspension of the sales and activation of new SIM cards across all phone networks in the country. Through the NCC, he directed Nigerians to ensure that their phone lines were connected to their National Identification Numbers (NIN) or risk losing the lines.\n\nNow, the suspension was expected, at the time, to last till the completion of the NIN registration. The date fixed was early January.\n\nExperts swore that it was an impossible mission. For in a decade, the NIMC registered less than 50 million people, how can the same organization be reasonably expected to sign on over 50 million people in under six weeks? The experts were right.\n\nSo, it was no surprise therefore that the deadlines had to be shifted repeatedly. The humongous crowd at the registration centres made Nigerians criticised the government for not making adequate provisions before the directive went into effect.\n\nBanning SIM sales precipitated what appears to be several unintended consequences. The number of internet subscribers dropped, no doubt, limiting the chance of meeting the NCC set broadband target.\n\nIn these days of reducing average revenue per user (ARPU), it is a case of declining revenue for the operators.\n\nWhile telcos can\u2019t be expected to complain openly, the impact was an open wound. It was visible for all to see.\n\nThe pain is equally real. Job loss. Revenue loss.\n\nAt a time, when the economy is witnessing diminishing revenues, these losses also mean a reduction in taxes payable to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the government\u2019s actions with its regulations. The situation is typical. The telecommunications industry is making massive contributions to the GDP, yet it was placed in a chokehold and left struggling to breathe.\n\nThankfully, this week, the sector can breathe again. Yes, Nigerians can breathe again.\n\nDarnella Frazier, the teenager whose viral video of George Floyd\u2019s murder helped the case, has been praised for her bravery. It would also be proper to laud all the analysts and writers who pushed tirelessly for the resumption of SIM sales in Nigeria.\n\nElvis Eromosele, a Corporate Communication professional and public affairs analyst lives in Lagos\n\n* Article was written a week prior publication.",
