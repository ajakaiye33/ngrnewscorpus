          "text": "Yusuff Moshood\n\nA biotech firm based in Abingdon, United Kingdom, has been granted permission to conduct a field test of its insects for the first time in the United States by releasing genetically-modified mosquitoes into the open air in Florida.\n\nApproximately 144,000 mosquitoes engineered by the UK-based biotech firm Oxitec are to be expected to be set free over the next three months, the first of up to 750 million approved for release over the next two years by the US Environmental Protection Agency, The Scientist reports.\n\nAccording to a report published on May 3 by Nature \u2013- an open access health journal \u2014 genetically modified mosquitoes are being tested to determine if they could help to suppress wild Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which can carry diseases such as Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever.\n\n\u201cAbout 12,000 males will exit the boxes each week over the next 12 weeks. In a second phase later this year, intended to collect even more data, nearly 20 million mosquitoes will emerge over a period of about 16 weeks, according to Oxitec,\u201d the journal added.\n\nThe regulatory approval for the experiment came after a decade of objections from some local critics.\n\nOxitec, the firm that developed the mosquitoes, has previously tested the insects in Brazil, Panama, the Cayman Islands and Malaysia.\n\nThe company had, however, faced pushback from residents of Florida in its attempt to conduct the trial of the genetically modified mosquitoes.\n\n\u201cWhen something new and revolutionary comes along, the immediate reaction of a lot of people is to say, \u2018Wait,\u2019 says Anthony James, a molecular biologist focused on bioengineered mosquitoes at the University of California, Irvine.\n\n\u201cSo, the fact that Oxitec was able to get the trial on the ground in the United States is a big deal.\u201d\n\nResearchers and technicians working on the project, according to the report, will release bioengineered male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which don\u2019t bite, to mate with the wild female population responsible for biting prey and transmitting disease.\n\nThe genetically engineered male mosquitoes carry a gene that passes to their offspring and kills female progeny in early larval stages. Male offspring won\u2019t die but instead will become carriers of the gene and pass it to future generations. As more females die, the Aedes aegypti population should dwindle.\n\nGenetically engineered mosquitoes are an alternative to insecticides, which are used heavily in the United States to control insect populations. This has resulted in the evolution of mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides.\n\nTo monitor the trial\u2019s progress, researchers will use capture devices to trap mosquitoes for study.\n\nThey will measure how far the male mosquitoes travel from the boxes, how long they live, how effectively they squelch the wild female mosquito population and whether all of the females with the gene are indeed dying.\n\nOxitec mosquitoes carry a fluorescent marker gene that makes them glow when exposed to a specific colour of light, which makes identification easier.\n\nThe biotech firm plans to present the results to the US Environmental Protection Agency, which gave the green light for the trial.\n\nThe data, the researchers said, will help the EPA to determine whether Oxitec can release mosquitoes more broadly in the United States.",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Obasanjo, Gumi broker release\n\n\u2026We share anguish of Greenfield varsity students\u2019 parents \u2013 Presidency\n\n\u2026Obasanjo cautions FG on payment of ransom, says Buhari, Jonathan govts paid ransom, but denied\n\ndoing so\n\n\u2026Arrest, interrogate Gumi now, Fani-Kayode tells FG\n\nThe remaining 29 students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State, have been released. This is even as former President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday cautioned the Federal Government against paying ransom to kidnappers and bandits, saying it is capable of encouraging criminals in their evil act.\n\nIt will be recalled that 39 students of the school were kidnapped 57 days ago by bandits who invaded and demanded payment of N500 million ransom to effect their release.\n\nBut 10 of the students had earlier been released in batches of five after their parents paid ransom.\n\nHusband of one of the kidnapped students who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the release of the students.\n\nObasanjo, Gumi helped secure release\n\nVanguard gathered that release of the students was facilitated by Sheikh Ahmad Gumi Dialogue committee, with the collaboration of former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nAlso confirming the release of the students, Abdullahi Usman, chairman of the Forum of Parents of the Abducted Students, said: \u201cYes, they have been released. They did not sleep in the (bandits\u2019) camp yesterday. They were taken to the residence of one of the mediators to sleep.\n\n\u201cWe have already sent our people with vehicles and ambulance to go and bring them. We are expecting them any moment from now.\u201d\n\nOn March 12, gunmen invaded the school located along Airport Road in Kaduna, and abducted 39 of the students.\n\nTen of them were released in two batches of five after the parents reportedly paid N17 million ransom.\n\n\u2018Big relief\u2018\n\nSpeaking on the release of the students, Usman said it is \u201ca big relief to parents\u201d, who have been \u201cemotionally traumatised\u201d since the incident took place.\n\nThe parents had, on Tuesday, protested at the National Assembly in Abuja.\n\nAttempts to reach Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State police command, for comments on the students\u2019 release at press time yesterday proved abortive.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had on Tuesday in Abuja, said the federal and Kaduna State governments were working assiduously to ensure the release of the students. Efforts also made to get the state government\u2019s reaction last night were unsuccessful.\n\nThe government had always insisted that it will not negotiate with bandits or kidnappers and also threatened to prosecute anyone who does so.\n\nControversies\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations for release of the remaining 29 students before they regained freedom yesterday was fraught with controversies, as parents of the students churned out conflicting details of the ordeals they suffered in the negotiation process.\n\nWhile a mother of one of the abducted students told a television platform, Roots TV, that a negotiator, popular Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, linked them with the abductors collected N800,000 as transportation fare to help, other parents dissociated themselves from the claim and apologised to Gumi for the claim.\n\nEarlier, 10 students were released in two batches of five, after their parents negotiated their way out, leaving 29 in the custody of abductors.\n\nThis came as the Presidency stated late Tuesday night that it shared in the anguish of parents of abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, who were kidnapped by bandits on April 20.\n\nAbout 23 students were kidnapped from the university by bandits who demanded N800 million to release the students, while five had been killed, with one other released after the parents reportedly paid N20 million to secure release of their ward.\n\nSpeaking with Roots TV, the woman whose identity was shielded for security reasons, said they had been trying to secure the release of the abducted students to no avail.\n\nShe said the parents had attended several meetings and were taken to Ahmad Gumi, prominent Islamic cleric, who directed them to a Fulani man, named Ahmed.\n\nShe said the parents paid N800,000 to the man who said the money was for transportation, while insisting that the parents pay an additional N500 million.\n\nThe woman, who claimed to be a widow, said: \u201dWe kept going for meetings. They took us to Gumi\u2019s house who said we should meet one Fulani man. We contributed almost N800,000 to him but he said the money was just for transportation.\n\n\u201dThen I started crying and pleaded with him that I am a widow, training my boy to become my helper in the future but he said that was not his concern.\u201d\n\nNoting that the unidentified Fulani man was invited to an office in Kaduna to meet the parents, she said: \u201cWe kept begging him but he insisted that we must pay N500 million.\n\nAnother parent, who said the trauma was too much to handle, said they had become \u201cwalking corpses\u201d.\n\n\u2018Trauma too much\u2019\n\nShe said: \u201cThe trauma is too much, I can hardly sleep. We are walking corpses. People see us as being alive but we are already dead. In the night, one cannot sleep, if you want to sleep you will be thinking about the condition of your child; if the child is dead, alive, or whether he had eaten.\n\n\u201cThey (kidnappers) were after the government paying that money\u2013 N500 million. Like me in particular, they kept calling me \u2018Madam, go and talk to the government to pay the money\u2019. All I kept telling them was that I am a widow, I don\u2019t have access to the government.\n\n\u201cMaybe if my husband were to be alive, he would know somebody who would help him to talk to the government. They kept calling me for almost two weeks and I told them the same thing.\u201d\n\nClaims, counter-claims\n\nHowever, other parents of the abducted students, who have now formed themselves into a group, have dissociated themselves from the remarks by the mother who said money was given to Sheikh Gumi for onward delivery to the abductors.\n\nThe parents, who apologized to the renowned Muslim scholar, said their attention was drawn to a screaming headline in May 5, 2021, in Roots TV to the effect that one of them claimed that they contributed and paid the sum of N800,000 to a Fulani man through Sheikh Gumi for the release of their children.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nIn a statement signed yesterday by chairman of Afaka Parents Forum, Malam Abdullahi Usman, and the secretary, Mrs. Catherine Y. Saleh, the parents said the claim had no basis .The statement read: \u201cThe woman is not a member of the committee representing the affected parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the Forum of the abducted parents has never gathered money and given to Gumi or to someone through the revered Islamic scholar at anytime. We, therefore, dissociate ourselves from the statement.\n\n\u201dThe committee considers the statement as unfortunate and an unnecessary distraction from its commitment to secure the release of the children who have now spent 56 days in captivity.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the committee representing the Forum of Parents of the 39 abducted students visited the home of Sheikh Gumi to seek his intervention for the release of our children but he declined, on the grounds that as a law abiding citizen, he would not want to go against the position of the state government which has forbidden anyone to negotiate with bandits.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the esteemed sheikh for any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\n\n\u201cAgain, we call on all to join our voices in calling on government at state and federal levels to work extra hard to ensure the safe release of our children, so they may be reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cWhile we await God\u2019s intervention for the release of our children, we call on all people of goodwill to join us in prayers as we continue to seek God\u2019s help for the release of our children.\u201d\n\nPresidency on Greenfield varsity kidnap\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency has said it shared in the anguish of parents of the abducted students of Greenfield University.\n\nThe is coming 15 days after gunmen stormed the university located along the Kaduna\u2013Abuja Highway in Chikun Local Government Area, and kidnapped several students.\n\nThe kidnappers have since killed five of the students and threatened to kill 16 others still in captivity if a ransom of N100 million and 10 motorcycles were not delivered to them.\n\nThe Presidency in a series on Tweets, said: \u201cWe deeply share the anguish of parents of the abducted Greenfield University students. \u201cThe Federal Government, through the military & intelligence agencies, is working to support the Kaduna State government to bring this tragic saga to an end with no further loss of innocent life.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure that good triumphs over evil, and that all of the bandits and criminals terrorizing innocent lives and communities are brought to book.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for all Nigerians to unite, regardless of religion, ethnicity or partisan affiliation\u2014against a common, dastardly enemy.\u201d\n\nObasanjo warns FG\n\nAlso yesterday, former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo cautioned the Federal Government against paying ransom to kidnappers and bandits, saying it will encourage criminals engaging in the dastardly act, if not stopped.\n\nObasanjo, who spoke while receiving members of Tiv Professionals Group, TPG, led by Prof Zacharys Anger Gundu, at his Penthouse residence at Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Obasanjo noted that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government and that of his predecessor, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, had paid ransom to kidnappers and bandits, but denied it.\n\nHe said government must develop ways to deal with kidnappers and bandits heavily in place of ransom payment.\n\nThe former President equally insisted that it requires a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach to fight insecurity challenges to a standstill.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation where anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is foolish. This is because when you pay ransom, you encourage. But if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it.\n\n\u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during Jonathan\u2019s administration. They paid ransom, but they denied it.\u201d\n\nThink of minorities, Obasanjo warns secessionist agitators\n\nWhile reliving the position of a military friend, Obasanjo expressed fears that those beating drums of division in Nigeria don\u2019t think about the interest of the minority ethnic groups.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe would say to me, if the Yorubas can stand as a country, if the Igbos can stand as a country, if the Hausa/Fulani can stand as a country, if you major tribes decide to break up from the country, where do you want the minority ethnic groups to stand? That, many Nigerians don\u2019t know about, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cWhere do we want those minor groups to stand? Wherever they stand, now they are by virtue of Nigeria\u2019s present situation a little bit protected. But if Nigeria breaks up and they are in a smaller country, they will be oppressed. They will always be exterminated. Are we thinking of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that if we will get it right in Nigeria, any leader must look at Nigeria with the prism of the diversity of Nigeria. For as long as you look at Nigeria with the prism of your ethnic group, then you aren\u2019t going anywhere, either your ethnic group or religious group. But is there hope? There is hope.\u201d\n\n\u2018A new Nigeria must emerge in 2023\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the 2023 elections, Obasanjo said leaders must ensure that it birthed emergence of a new federation in Nigeria, adding that the country might slide into dissolution.\n\nObasanjo, who bemoaned insecurity challenges, insisted that 2023 must mark a watershed for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI do believe that whatever else we do, we have to make the year 2023 a watershed for Nigeria. The year 2023 should give us the beginning of emergence of a new federation or feeling that the rot continues, and then, we are going to be sliding back to a grand dissolution. God forbid,\u201d the former President said.\n\nN800,000 transport fare: Fani-Kayode wants Gumi arrested\n\nReacting yesterday to Sheikh Gumi\u2019s closeness to bandits and claims by a parent of one of the abducted students that Gumi linked the parents with a negotiator who collected N800,000 as transport fare, former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, called for his arrest.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, Fani-Kayode said if Gumi knew about the money allegedly paid, the government should invite him for interrogation. \u201cI hereby call on the Federal Government to invite, arrest and interrogate Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\n\n\u201cAssuming this lady\u2019s testimony is true, it provides clear evidence of him being an accessory and accomplice to terrorism, abduction, kidnapping and murder.\n\n\u201cIf this were not the case, he would not spend his entire life attempting to defend, justify, rationalise and explain their barbaric, homicidal, savage and beastly ways.\n\n\u201cThese people have so much blood on their hands yet Gumi still holds himself out as their advocate and best friend,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former minister said if the Federal Government refused to act against Gumi, it would raise questions about its commitment to fighting terror and stopping the terrorists.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Presidency has come under fire over its Tuesday allegation that it has evidence that some \u2018disruptive elements\u2019 are planning to recruit ethnic groups and politicians to pass a vote of no confidence on the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe allegation by the Presidency, though came short of directly accusing the \u2018disruptive elements\u2019, which it described as religious leaders and former political leaders, of planning to overthrow the Buhari administration, its use of words, including earlier statements by the Military and the Department of State Services (DSS), were read by Nigerians, including prominent members of the Nigerian society and groups, to mean that the Presidency was alluding to an overthrow of the government.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Robert Clark obviously stirred the hornet\u2019s nest when, during a television interview, suggested that the military should take over government temporarily in order to restructure the country.\n\nClark\u2019s, suggestion, though unpopular with Nigerians, came on the heels of growing discontent in the country over worsening insecurity that has led to unprecedented fear in the country, and calls for President Buhari to rein in the criminal elements terrorising Nigerians.\n\nMr. Femi Adesina, the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, in a statement on Tuesday, said the motive behind the plan by the \u2018disruptive elements\u2019 was to throw the country into further turmoil.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Department of State Services on Sunday alerted on sinister moves by misguided elements to wreak havoc on the government, sovereignty and corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cChampioned by some disgruntled religious and past political leaders, the intention is to eventually throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel a forceful and undemocratic change of leadership.\n\n\u201cFurther unimpeachable evidence shows that these disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed in the President, thus throwing the land into further turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country.\n\n\u201cThe agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nPeeved by the allegation by the presidency, several Nigerians and groups, including the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Afenifere, the Yoruba sociocultural group, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), among others, have come hard on the presidency, accusing it of heating up the polity and reading meanings to every sincere comment and advice by Nigerians.\n\nFor the ACF, it was uncharitable for the Presidency to see and call every dissenting voice or perceived critics of the All Progressives Congress (APC) government as disgruntled elements.\n\nThe group, which spoke through its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, said the Presidency has a penchant for viewing every critic with dark motives, which it said was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency must be broad-minded enough to accommodate all shades of opinions. The criticism is done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country. It is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country\u201d, the ACF spokesman said.\n\nPANDEF on its part, accused the Presidency of chasing shadows instead of looking for how to surmount the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nAccording to PANDEF\u2019s spokesman, Ken Robinson, tagging religious leaders and past political leaders as disgruntled elements under the current security situation in the country was shocking and least expected.\n\n\u201cPANDEF cautions that the Presidency should stop chasing shadows. Citizens are anxious and troubled, many are becoming hopeless, with even the security agencies seemingly helpless and vulnerable\u201d, Robinson said.\n\nFor the PDP, the statement from the Presidency only shows that President Buhari and the ruling APC were being haunted by their shadows, insisting that they are afraid of experiencing what they did to others in the past.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP added that the allegation by the Presidency was only a desperate attempt by the Buhari administration to blackmail Nigerians to cover up for its failures.\n\n\u201cRather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing our nation, the Presidency is busy engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, imperative to state that the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically elected governments.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the Presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood\u201d, the party said.\n\nFor elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, the Buhari administration was only embarking on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue, adding that he does not support any change of government other than through the ballot box.\n\nYakasai said: \u201cIt is not enough to embark on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue. We have yet to recover from the violent overthrow of the Tafawa Balewa-led first Republic by young military officers. I do not support any change of government other than that which comes through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe apex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, also distanced itself from the allegation by the Presidency, saying it is not interested in anything coup.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, however, said that even the President himself knows that all was not well with the country.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze is not interested in anything coup. Ohanaeze is interested that the President should listen to us and address the nation. The President should reorder his steps. He should root his governance in justice because everything has become injustice especially to the Igbo,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum (MBF), on its part, viewed the allegation by the Presidency as an insult to the sensibilities of Nigerians, reminding the President that Nigeria was operating a democratic system of government.\n\nThe group\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Dr Isuwa Dogo said: \u201cWe view the statement as an expression of guilt by the Presidency for the deteriorating situation of things in the country including insecurity and its inability to stop it.\u201d\n\nFor the Afenifere, the allegation was a non issue, as its leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo insisted that Afenifere and other sociocultural groups in the South are only interested in the peaceful restructuring of the country.\n\n\u201cWho is interested in passing a vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him\u201d, Adebanjo asked.\n\nExpectedly, Nigerians took to the social media, especially the micro blogging site, Twitter to express their anger and views on the allegation from the Presidency, with most declaring that it was a mere propaganda to divert attention from the real issues begging for attention.\n\nFor many, the allegation was also in line with the known blame game of the Buhari administration.\n\nFor Twitter user @IdorenyinEtuk5, an amendment of the Nigerian constitution to allow for citizens to call for early elections if not happy with government\u2019s performance would have exposed the Buhari administration.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cLet presidency call for amendment to the constitution to allow for citizens to call for early elections if they are dissatisfied with their govt and let\u2019s see how Buhari will fair since they are worried about calls for Buhari\u2019s removal as if it were illegal. DSS are so worthless to have said that it was a threat to national security. Same DSS that has nothing to offer where real threats to citizens are concerned. DSS must be scrapped, all its point men and women sacked.\u201d\n\nFor @Abdultiggi, if removing the President will bring solution to the problems in the country, so be it. He wrote: \u201cIf by removing him will bring solution to the country then why not? Insecurity is killing our nation\u201d, while @cthereality, concurred with him, declaring the statement from the Presidency was a cheap propaganda.\n\n\u201cMy brother, this is the cheapest propaganda I\u2019ve ever heard. Instead of facing the reality on ground, they\u2019re busy raising false alarm. All we need is security. If they can\u2019t secure us, what options do we have?\u201d, he said.\n\nFor @sticksnsnares, removing the President to have a secure Nigeria is a welcome idea. He wrote: \u201cWhatever they can do to remove him is on course. killings and kidnappings everyday and the President has refused to do anything but raising force alarm. A President that cannot come out openly to address his people, all we see are pictures. Prices of goods increase everyday\u201d, while @udehNudeh prayed for the success of the plot, if there is any, insisting that Buhari did same thing before.. He wrote: \u201cMay the plot succeed. Why is @MBuhari afriad of being overthrown? But he had overthrown someone and made someone\u2019s Government ungovernable\u2026. He who lives in a glass shouldn\u2019t throw stones\u2026.\u201d\n\nFor @DopplerFilmz, removing President Buhari would not be any big deal because he was once removed. \u201cHe was removed the first time, removing him again, at this time, will be a blessing to this nation\u201d, he wrote while @creality wants government to concentrate on the real issues. \u201cPlease stop diverting our attention and fix what\u2019s facing us. What a cheap propaganda\u201d, he said.\n\n@ucheclive believes the allegation by the presidency was part of the blame game of the Buhari administration, while @tobiduddleycoker wondered why the President and his handlers are afraid. \u201c@MBuhari @GarShehu @FemAdesina you all are afraid; nobody is removing Buhari forcefully. Your ghost is chasing you. It is better @MBuhari resigns honorably for being a failure\u201d, he wrote, while @abelcifezie declared that the government was merely chasing shadows.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cBeing chased by their shadows. No more, no less. Alleged #EndSars sponsors were \u201cunmasked\u201d in less than two weeks and their accounts frozen! Why can\u2019t these people, who are more dangerous, be unmasked and picked up? Smells like a hoax, or a kite being flown!\u201d",

          "text": "By Oyebola Owolabi\n\nLagos State will pay 4,000 unemployed graduates N40,000 monthly for six months, Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment Mrs. Yetunde Arobieke said yesterday.\n\nShe addressed reporters as part of activities to mark Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s second year in office.\n\nAccording to her, this would be implemented through the ministry\u2019s Graduate Internship Placement Programme (GIPP) intended to address unemployment.\n\nThe commissioner said the programme, planned to last for six months, would expose interns to a particular job, profession or industry and enhance networking. Through the initiative, interns will be given the opportunity to excel and possibly learn a job with the organisation as they are exposed to professional skills and interpersonal relationships in a structured setting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe said: \u201cThe GIPP is to assist Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and other companies to choose from the state\u2019s database of groomed talent/interns, to enhance productivity and boost their businesses, thereby promoting economic growth at no cost through government\u2019s intervention.\n\n\u201c51,514 graduates applied for the internship online; over 1,932 companies indicated interest to onboard the interns after their trainings and 4,736 applicants attempted the online assessment test.\n\n\u201cAbout 1,000 candidates who scored a minimum of 60 per cent were invited for the first tranche of the training, 4,000 interns are targeted to be placed on a monthly stipend of N40,000 for six months.\u201d\n\nAccording to the commissioner, 123,720 jobs have been created and 14,646 small businesses supported since the ministry was established in 2015. She added that 51,142 new tax payers were on-boarded and 3,395 young persons were placed in jobs.\n\nThe state, in April 2020, established its Cash Transfer Unit as part of efforts to domesticate the National Cash Transfer Programme (NCTP) of the Federal Government. N269,340 was paid to 6,810 indigent households.\n\nArobieke said the ministry was also working towards establishing an Artisans\u2019 Virtual Market to encourage the ease of doing business and make transactions seamless. Accordingly to her, artisans would be on-boarded onto the portal; residents can call for services online and give a report afterward as the portal would have a feedback system.\n\nThe commissioner also intimated that the ministry, through its various programmes, had tackled unemployment and humanitarian issues. Such programmes included sensitisation workshop for exited N-Power beneficiaries (Batches A and B); payment if Federal Government special grant for rural women; graduate internship programme; employability skills training; capacity building/ training for tradesmen and artisans, provision of COVID-19 palliatives to artisans who are registered members of an association, among others.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nThe Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), Fr. Ejike Mbaka. has said he was not arrested or detained by security agents.\n\nThe cleric, who arrived to a rousing welcome at the Adoration Ground around 7:15pm told faithful he was invited to a meeting with the Bishop of Enugu Catholic Diocese, Callistus Onaga, where he was ordered to vacate the adoration ground and remain silent for 30 days.\n\nHe said he was surprised to see other persons at the meeting which he thought was only between him and the Bishop.\n\nHe said there was a plan to shut the adoration ground over his recent comments against the government.\n\n\u201cThey ordered me to leave the Adoration Ground for 30 days; to be silent for 30 days and to leave Enugu. Their plan was to even send me to Rome after the 30 days.\n\n\u201cI asked them why I was being punished. They cannot not tell me who to bless. They are angry that I blessed Nnamdi Kanu. I am a priest of God and nobody can tell me who to bless. Is it your blessing? Are you the one giving him life? Are you the one giving him life? Go and take away God\u2019s blessings from him.\n\n\u201cIf you said I spoke against government is there no insecurity in the country? Are they angry that I said government should provide jobs for the youths? I am a priest of God and I will continue to bless and speak the truth.\n\n\u201cI saw the implication of keeping me there. I told them that my people will look for me if they don\u2019t allow me to attend today\u2019s programme (E no dey again).\n\n\u201cWhat would have happened if I had has left Enugu as they instructed? We are a people of peace so I want you all to be peaceful. We wilI meet here again on Sunday God willing.\u201d\n\nPandemonium had broken out, yesterday, as thousands of adherents took to the streets seeking the whereabouts of the fiery priest.\n\nHis followers had stormed the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Bishop Callistus Onaga, demanding his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to the protesters, Bishop had invited Mbaka for a meeting by 10am on Tuesday and they had neither seen nor heard from him since then.\n\nThe cleric, however, showed up at about 2:50pm as tension was reaching a breaking point on his whereabouts with many alleging that government was complicit in his \u2018disappearance\u2019.\n\nHe emerged at the junction of Igboeze Street where he alighted from an SUV and urged protesters to return to Adoration Ground in Umuchigbo for him to address them. It was learnt that the priest may have emerged from the Government House axis of Enugu.\n\nEyewitnesses said having received no positive response and fearing that the bishop may have handed the priest to security agents, the protesters had descended on Bishop\u2019s Court, residence of Bishop Onaga, and vandalised property, especially glasses, doors, the Bishop\u2019s office before marching to destroy a bookshop, guest house, two buildings, four big water tanks and other facilities at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Some workers there sustained various degrees of injury.\n\nThere was heavy presence of joint security forces of the army, police, National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services both at the Bishop\u2019s Court and the Holy Ghost Cathedral.\n\nDSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, had denied that Mbaka was in their custody.\n\nFears of his possible arrest arose as Mbaka last week Wednesday called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over worsening security challenges in the country.\n\nLast Sunday, the DSS issued a warning to individuals and groups to be mindful of utterances and actions that threatened the country\u2019s peace and sovereignty.",

The agitators have their reasons. But I believe in a united Nigeria; I believe that Nigeria should look into the complaints of the people of the South East.

          "title": "Baba Ijesha\u2019s felony, and Nollywood adversaries",
          "text": "I could never get myself to watch the video where Lanre Omiyinka, the actor popularly known as Baba Ijesha, now in the eye of the storm for alleged defilement and molestation of a minor, was caught pants down last week. I do not only consider it an abuse of the rights and psychology of the young lady involved, it also infringes on my own sensibility as a human being and father of children. I would find it repugnant and repulsive to watch that video especially as I had seen the confessional video, which was released earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo clarify though, my objection is ethical than legal. I do not think there could be any question as to the admissibility of this evidence in court. Even though I would have wanted a situation where the foster mother of this girl brought in the police and possibly child psychologists to mitigate the lasting effect that this sting operation may have on the 14-year-old.\n\nAs traumatic as it is, the sting operation seems inevitable. Without the video, it would just have been Princess Damilola Adekola\u2019s word against Omiyinka\u2019s and those words would most likely count for nothing. The execution of this plan would however have had more consideration for the child involved, which is what the involvement of law enforcement agents and social workers would have ensured. Accounts of the video that I have heard suggest that it would pass for child pornography; but that is a matter for another day. The objective of this intervention is to suggest that the drama around the sad event and the video that follows it shows a few things about Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system and the citizens.\n\nEvents towards the end of last week indicate very clearly that a significant number of Nigerians have no confidence in the criminal justice system. Reports made the rounds that the police were at the verge of granting Omiyinka bail. The report, which now seems to be false in some material details, also indicated that no case could be established against the accused and that the defilement of the girl seven years ago had become statute barred having not been reported at the time! Immediately, an army of activists arose, identified the report as an attempt to push the matter under the carpet and threatened to rain fire and brimstone on the earth if Omiyinka was granted bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis point suggests that the challenge may surpass the entrenched distrust of the system into ignorance of the law and its operation. Some of the arguments put forward on that day suggested that the agitators could not even distinguish between the roles of the police, the attorney-general\u2019s office, and the judge. As a result, the moment news filtered in that the culprit might be released, comments about prospects that a judge might have been bribed started flying around. Now, that is ludicrous because at this time, the police had not even received advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions as is required! Neither do the arguments take cognisance of the fact that judges decide cases based on the quality of evidence presented to them and the diligence of prosecution.\n\nNow, whether the people\u2019s disposition is borne out of disillusionment or ignorance of the workings of the law, it is adversarial to national interest. For as long as Nigeria remains a democracy, the judiciary and all prosecutorial agencies that facilitate its work remain essential ingredients in the development of democracy, the balance of power and the emancipation of the people. Any people who insist on being suspicious or remaining ignorant of the workings of their country justice system are simply not ready to make their country better.\n\nDoes this then suggest that the Nigerian judiciary is above board and infallible or that its failings be excused? Absolutely not! If only for the fact that judges are human, they can make errors, sometimes induced, sometimes unintended. But more than that, judicial systems across the world have bad eggs who, by their conduct, inflict disrepute on their calling. It is even more so in Nigeria where corruption has literally become a citizen. Yet, even that does not excuse citizens\u2019 ridicule of the judiciary because its reputation is a good measure of the country\u2019s civilisation, especially as Nigeria does not credit herself with much in most other spheres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerians must realise that the judicial system is also conscious of its own tendency for imperfections. In democracies like ours, there are hierarchy of courts, with the powers to review cases where a miscarriage of justice is perceived from the lower courts. Even though we find reasons to occasionally query the decisions of courts, Nigerians must also understand, as they advocate a better judicial system, the need to respect the extant procedures including respecting the rights of other people as we would want ours to be respected. If an offence is bailable, we must not arm-twist agencies of the law into continuing to detain people on the basis of our sentiments; the law must always be the law and all citizens must respect it. Without that, we would be calling for anarchy and guilty of what we accuse our leaders for.\n\nThe other thing is that when matters come to an end that they got in Baba Ijesha\u2019s case, the mental health of the minor involved must be a priority. While it is gratifying that some of the most vocal voices against Omiyinka\u2019s alleged misdeed are his colleagues in the film industry, activities of the past two week show that people have different motives for their activist roles. However, any agenda that subordinates the young girl\u2019s interest is unhealthy. No intervention should be undertaken without a due consideration on the effect it might have on the victim.\n\nMost importantly however, society must do its best to protect this child and in fact every other Nigerian child from defilement and all forms of abuse that has the tendency to leave them with life-long scars. The way we treat our children, as Nelson Mandela once said, is the keenest revelations of the state of our soul.\n\nFinally, this society must now reconsider its attitude to trying sex-related criminal offences, generally but more specifically as it concerns the defilement of children. True, between the Criminal Code, the Penal Code and the Child Rights Act, there are copious punishments ranging from 12 years to life imprisonment for convicts of sex-related offences, but what is the standard of proof and how often are convictions secured?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, there have been questions as to the sense behind committing an offence by having sex with girls under the age of 13 is bailable and statue-barred when it is regarded as a felony in S. 218 of the Criminal Code Act (2004)\n\nAt the moment, ingredients that must be proved before an allegation of rape include: the actual occurrence of sexual intercourse with the victim; that the sexual act was without consent or that the consent was obtained by fraud, force or intimidation, deceit or impersonation; that the victim was not the spouse of the accused; that the accused had the mens rea, the intention to have sexual intercourse with the victim without consent or that the accused acted recklessly not caring whether the victim consented or not and that there was penetration. In addition, some of these ingredients, including in defilement, presuppose the need for corroboration as decided in Iko V. State (2001) 14NWLR(PT.732)195(2001) 7 S.C(PT.11) 115. Worse still, this requirement is not satisfied by an early report of the crime.\n\nSo, does this not contribute to the erosion of people\u2019s trust in the judiciary? Maybe, it does but that again is due to lack of understanding. A judge only works with the provision of the laws and so, what Nigerians should clamour with as much vehemence as possible is the review of these laws by the lawmaking arm of government. There is so much work to do to make this country worthy of that name but one of the most critical is the protection of its children from all forms of abuse.\n\nAdedokun tweets @niranadedokun",

          "title": "MAN IN THE NEWS: Ahmad Gumi, the unofficial kakaki of bandits",
          "text": "Gumi. Whenever the four-lettered name crops up in the news, more often than not, what follows is an avalanche of banditry romanticisation: painting the gun-wielding criminals as \u2018victims of circumstance\u2019; shushing the media not to bark at bandits but to address them with \u201cnice words\u201d; blaming the government and the system for their decision to make \u2018kidnap for ransom\u2019 a thriving industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhmad Gumi, a prominent Islamic cleric, has for the past few months positioned himself as the unofficial spokesman for bandits. \u201cAs a matter of fact, they are probably ready to listen to him more than they are ready to listen to the government,\u201d Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, once said, in recognition of his access to bandits.\n\nGumi infantilises them and tells their story with a tone of sympathy. In February, he shocked Nigerians when he said the bandits are not interested in killing people and that the \u201cfew\u201d they have murdered are \u201caccidental\u201d cases. He called them ethnic militia and rejected the \u201cbandits\u201d tag. He also described them as \u201cvery shy people\u201d who deserve to be forgiven and compensated.\n\nGumi, a former army officer who retired as a captain, dominated headlines in January when over 500 bandits terrorising Zaria-Giwa roads, as well as Birnin Gwari area in Kaduna state, reportedly laid down their arms after he persuaded them into a peace deal. Since then, he has remained front and centre on the issue of banditry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nACCESS TO BANDITS\n\nAfter facilitating the surrender of the aforementioned group, Gumi commenced a five-day visitation to dens of bandits across Zamfara state. Tubali and Makkai forests in Shinkafi LGA of the state were among his destinations. There, he met with groups of bandits that had been elusive to the security forces, and held a meeting with them while preaching peace. He assured them that their grievances are \u201clegitimate\u201d, equating their struggles with those of the Niger Delta militants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGumi\u2019s access to bandits also took him into the Tagina forest in Niger state. But a few days after his visit, a group of outlaws attacked Government Science College, Kagara LGA of the state, kidnapping 27 students. The cleric later said the gang of bandits he met were not the abductors.\n\nDEMANDING AMNESTY FOR BANDITS\n\nNow an established middleman between the federal government and bandits, Gumi positions himself as an orchestrator of peace deals. He once urged the government to provide blanket amnesty to bandits despite the havoc they wreak and lives they claim. The cleric referenced the pardon of those that ignited the Nigerian civil war. He added that if coup plotters can be forgiven, why not bandits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wonder who is not a criminal,\u201d Gumi had said.\n\n\u201cEven those that instigated the civil war, the civil war that millions of people died [in], were pardoned. I see no reason why we cannot accept their [bandits] repentance and give them amnesty.\n\n\u201cIf the country could pardon coup plotters who committed treasonable offences in the era of military administration, the bandits can as well enjoy similar forgiveness even better under democratic rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018BRING THE MONEY FROM CBN\u2019\n\nOn April 18, another gang of bandits attacked Greenfield University, Kaduna state. They kidnapped several students while demanding N100 million ransom from the government. They have since killed five of them in a desperate attempt to hasten the response to their demand.\n\nThis has created a cloud of sadness and confusion over the past few weeks. The Kaduna state government remains resolute in its refusal to negotiate with bandits while the aggrieved parents wail for an intervention of any sort. Amidst this turmoil, Gumi has again emerged as an \u2018advocate of ransom\u2019. He advised the government to pay the ransom and do so with money from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He claimed that the bandits have been infiltrated by Boko Haram. He described the abductors as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and said he needs help in weaning them from their ideology.\n\n\u201cFive souls were killed. Why? What amount of money is too big for us to save the lives of those five students, what amount of money?\u201d Gumi asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSecondly, we can give them the money to get the boys out of danger then go after our money. Nobody is saying you shouldn\u2019t find them, you can get the two back.\n\n\u201cNow, we have two groups of bandits. We have the ordinary Fulani ethnic herdsmen and now there is another element which is coming in, it is the terrorist, the religious ideologies and this is what I\u2019ve been fearing.\u201d\n\n\u2018INVOLVEMENT\u2019 IN RANSOM PAYMENT\n\nOn Tuesday, one of the parents of the 29 kidnapped students of College of Forestry Mechanisation Afaka, Kaduna state had alleged that Gumi connected them to a suspected negotiator for the abductors.\n\nShe had said the parents paid N800,000 to the man but he said the money was for transportation and insisted that they cough up an additional N500 million.\n\n\u201cWe kept going for meetings. They took us to Gumi\u2019s house who said we should meet one Ahmed. I\u2019ve forgotten the name. A Fulani man was invited, we contributed almost N800,000 to him but he said the money was just for transportation,\u201d she had said.\n\nBut Gumi told TheCable that the allegation is \u201cnonsense\u201d, maintaining that he is not aware of such transaction \u2014 although he neither denied nor confirmed linking the parents to the suspected negotiator.\n\n\u201cAbsolute nonsense. I don\u2019t know anything about any money transaction,\u201d he responded via a text message.\n\nSources had later informed TheCable that the allegation was detrimental to the negotiation for the release of the students.

          "text": "Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu started Carry1st in 2018 to publish mobile games and interactive content for Africans. One of their games, Carry1st Trivia, got a lot of buzz in 2020 with about one and a half million downloads.\n\nIn the three years since its launch, Carry1st has also become a medium for bringing mobile gaming from global companies to Africa. The Cape Town-based company realised that developers have had problems with distribution and payments in Africa.\n\nThey decided to solve that by embedding a fintech solution, Pay1st, on their platform. Pay1st features popular payment methods from six African countries, giving African gamers on Carry1st the ability to pay how they want.\n\nThe result is a company that is a publishing platform for games but also a full-stack management solution for game developers seeking user acquisition, marketing and monetization in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we were able to successfully sign 7 great titles, recruit a top-notch international team, and build out our payments and digital commerce platform,\u201d Robbin-Coker, CEO of Carry1st, said in a statement.\n\nRight to Left: Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu, Carry1st co-founders. Image source: Carry1st.\n\nNow the startup is positioned to take advantage of the stability and opportunity they have found. They have announced the close of a $6 million Series A round led by Konvoy Ventures, an early-stage VC firm based in the US State of Colorado. Carry1st joins a list of other gaming companies on Konvoy\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJackson Vaughan, Managing Partner at Konvoy Ventures, joins Carry1st\u2019s board as a result of the investment. He said Carry1st\u2019s advantage is in \u201capproaching sub-regions with contextual understanding.\u201d\n\nOther investors in the round include Riot Games (the company behind \u2018League of Legends\u2019), Raine Ventures, AET Fund / Akatsuki and TTV Capital.\n\nWith this round, Carry1st has now raised $9.5m since it was founded. The most recent funding round before this was in May 2020 when they raised $2.5million from a seed round led by CRE Venture Capital.\n\nCarry1st plans to enter new partnerships with global gaming studios. Their existing partnerships cut across continents: with Raketspel in Sweden, New York-based Cosi Games, and Ethiopian developer Qene Games.\n\nThey also intend to launch new games and scale existing ones. To achieve that, they plan to hire more staff for product, engineering, and growth. The strategy is welcome by their latest investors.\n\n\u201cAt Riot, we have seen first hand the importance of partnering with local experts to bring the best possible gaming experience to players,\u201d Brendan Mulligan, Head of Corporate Development at Riot Games, said.\n\n\u201cAs the number of gamers in Africa explodes, we\u2019re excited to work with Cordel and Carry1st as they introduce game developers from all over the world to an important and passionate audience.\u201d\n\nCarry1st could be an engine for driving the mobile gaming economy in Africa, tapping into a growing global wave.\n\n36% of all mobile app downloads in 2020 were mobile games, according to App Annie, the mobile apps analytics company. 70% of all app purchases on the Apple store and Google Play in 2020 was on games.\n\nThe upward trajectory in mobile game spend is set to continue this year, reaching $120 billion.",

          "text": "Lami, a Kenyan insurtech company democratizing insurance products and services for low-income Kenyans, has raised $1.8 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Accion Venture Lab.\n\nFounded by Jihan Abass in 2018, Lami is a digital insurance platform that enables partner businesses \u2013 including banks, tech companies, and other entities to easily and seamlessly offer digital insurance products to their users via its API.\n\nLami can also be used by partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs. Through its API, users can get a quotation for motor, medical, or other tailored insurance products in seconds, then customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit their needs. They get their policy documents instantly and claims are paid in record time.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal Abass said, \u201cSimilar to a payment API/gateway, we process insurance KYC, pricing of products, underwriting of products and claims processing in real time. Let me give you an example, Jumia wanted to launch an insurance marketplace but they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of integrating with every single insurance company and they didn\u2019t want to manage the process of issuing policies. Using our API because we have 20 insurance companies on our platform, they were able to launch this marketplace with a large number of products.\u201d\n\nJulian Abbas Founder & CEO\n\nThe Insurance space in Africa\n\nWith a 3% penetration rate (except for South Africa), Africa\u2019s insurance market is lagging behind. In Kenya where Lami is based less than 20% of the population has access to health insurance.\n\nThe major cause of the low adoption is that most insurance providers on the continent fail to offer flexible, affordable and tailored insurance coverage that can provide a safety net for the African consumer. For example, under most health policies customers face restrictions on what facilities and treatments are covered, they struggle to understand coverage terms and face complicated and lengthy claims processes. This results in a longer processing cycle, poor customer satisfaction, and higher distribution costs.\n\nLami\u2019s services are enabled by its flexible insurance rating engine and direct integration with several parties and insurance companies. Lami co-designs innovative products with its underwriting partners to enable businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base, with flexible options that meet their needs and cash flows, such as monthly medical policies for startup employees.\n\nLami\u2019s CEO Jihan Abass said, \u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more people, improving our technology, and growing our presence across Africa as we can continue to address the persistent insurance gap. At Lami, our vision is to help improve the financial resilience of millions by making insurance products more accessible and affordable for underserved populations. By enabling our business partners to offer customized insurance solutions, we are helping them provide more value to their customers, while enabling large volumes of users to access insurance, often for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe Lami team at work\n\nSince its inception, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies and has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer, and Madison Insurance, distributing more than 30 products available including medical, motor, employee benefits, and device insurance. As an innovator in the digital insurance space, Lami aims to continue diversifying its business by looking for new partners and building on its core technology.\n\nMichael Schlein, President and CEO, Accion Venture Lab, said, \u201cNinety-seven percent of Africans lack access to insurance \u2013 a financial safety net that can help them build resilience against economic shocks. Lami helps address this need for consumers across Africa through its innovative approach that leverages technology and partnerships to help any business develop and sell insurance.\u201d\n\nWithin the past month Malian insurtech OKO and Nigerian insurtech Curacel raised a combined amount of $1.6 million, Lami\u2019s funding news is a reminder that there\u2019s some activity in the African insurtech space. Also, with less than 5% of venture capital going to female-led startups in 2019, it\u2019s positive news to see another female-led company being funded.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has extended the May 9 deadline for Nigerian mobile subscribers to link their National Identity Numbers (NINs) to their SIM cards. This announcement marks the fourth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

          "text": "As part of its tradition to drive impactful conversations that lead to the development of Africa, the University of Oxford Africa Society is hosting its 2021 Oxford Africa Conference from May 28-30th, 2021.\n\nThis year\u2019s conference will feature prominent and world-class speakers from across political, social, economic, environmental, health, and technology spectrums, including Dr Toyin Saraki (Founder-President, The Wellbeing Foundation), Jose Massano (Angola\u2019s Central Bank Governor) and Minister Audu Ogbe (Nigeria\u2019s former minister of Agriculture). The conference\u2019s overarching theme is re-asserting Africa\u2019s story and creating opportunities from the prevalent challenges, rather than only discussing them.\n\nIn line with this objective, the conference\u2019s Innovation Fair, a five-year-old initiative within the Oxford Africa Conference, will take place on May 28th and 29th, 2021. This year, a cohort of 11 early-stage ventures from over 150 applications have been selected for the Fair.\n\nThese ventures operate in African countries across four sectors critical to the continent\u2019s post-pandemic future: creative (art, fashion, film etc.), education, healthcare, and sustainability. Prior to the Fair, the ventures will conduct strategy with the MBA cohort at Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. For the two days, the companies will receive networking opportunities, masterclasses, and mentorship. The Fair will culminate in a pitch competition where cash prizes will be awarded to the winners.\n\nThis pitch competition will be live streamed for conference attendees on Saturday, May 29, from 2 to 5 pm. Each pitch will include a 5-minute Q&A session with a judging panel made up of academics and investors connected to the University of Oxford.\n\nTo be part of these impactful programs, you can purchase a ticket to the conference here and gain access to world-class speakers and view exciting start-ups reshaping Africa\u2019s future.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nComments",

Hopefully, such raises will cumulatively change African\u2019s apathy towards derisking.\n\nNot to digress, African early-stage startups hardly get access to large funds, especially non-fintechs, unlike Clubhouse, which is already valued at $1billion in its ninth month.\n\nIn Techpoint Africa\u2018s recent Nigerian startup funding report for Q1 2021, of the 18 deals recorded, 2 fintech startups \u2014 via Series A and Series C rounds \u2014 contributed 89% of the $219 million raised.\n\nIn slightly related terms, bagging investment can be quite challenging for young startups, but with some exemptions.

But that\u2019s minute compared to the $42.7 million raised at the height of the sector\u2019s popularity in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria has seen a crypto ban and restriction on tech-enabled investment platforms. Fintech companies\u2019 access to the BVN database has also been limited.\n\nThe business model of most startups rests on people being able to access the Internet, but there\u2019s a distinct lack of Internet access across several African countries. Kenya and South Africa have witnessed the most progress in the spread of 4G and the launch of the 5G network.\n\nNigeria is currently laying the foundation for the deployment of 5G, but there are substantial issues, which I explored here, that need to be addressed before anyone gets excited.\n\nSilver linings: Despite these interferences, Nigerian startups keep finding ways to innovate. Experts would agree that this is not the best scenario for attracting more investors or generating revenue, but business must go on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s decision to disconnect crypto platforms from the country\u2019s banking system, Nigerians have turned to P2P and continue to lead the way.\n\nThe ecosystem is growing, with serial entrepreneurs launching syndicate funds to support early-stage startups.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nNigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions.

Fintech companies\u2019 access to the BVN database has also been limited.\n\nThe business model of most startups rests on people being able to access the Internet, but there\u2019s a distinct lack of Internet access across several African countries. Kenya and South Africa have witnessed the most progress in the spread of 4G and the launch of the 5G network.\n\nNigeria is currently laying the foundation for the deployment of 5G, but there are substantial issues, which I explored here, that need to be addressed before anyone gets excited.\n\nSilver linings: Despite these interferences, Nigerian startups keep finding ways to innovate. Experts would agree that this is not the best scenario for attracting more investors or generating revenue, but business must go on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s decision to disconnect crypto platforms from the country\u2019s banking system, Nigerians have turned to P2P and continue to lead the way.\n\nThe ecosystem is growing, with serial entrepreneurs launching syndicate funds to support early-stage startups.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nNigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions.

From past startup raises, this is one of the largest pre-seeds ever recorded in the African startup ecosystem, and also the largest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, as the startup\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Mohamed Mossaad stated that there was more to come during an $850,000 pre-seed raise in March.\n\nEgyptian VC Foundation Ventures, Y Combinator, MSA Capital, CRE Ventures, Alter Global, Jameel Investment Management Company (JIMCO), B&Y Ventures Partners, and Access Bridge Ventures all invested in this round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngel investments were gotten from an anonymous Sequoia Capital scout, investors in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, and digital freight forwarder and custom broker, \u201cFlexport\u201d.\n\nMossaad told TechCrunch that the funding would spur the company\u2019s ambition to capture a large portion of the MENA region\u2019s $25 billion eCommerce logistics market. The company\u2019s vision is to strengthen its presence in Egypt before the year ends.\n\nFlextock\u2019s eCommerce fulfilment services manage operations like warehousing, delivery, and logistics for eCommerce companies to ease the burden of these needs and enable effective scaling of business activities.\n\nThis leap by Flextock might reveal the viability of Africa\u2019s eCommerce fulfilment services.

          "text": "Controversial Catholic priest, Ejike Mbaka, has opened up on why some unruly youths on Wednesday attacked the official residence of the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese over the rumour of his (Mbaka\u2019s) \u201cdisappearance\u201d.\n\nThere was apprehension in Enugu city on Wednesday over the news that Mr Mbaka, who heads the Adoration Ministry, was \u201cmissing\u201d, having not been seen at the adoration ground, apparently.\n\nThe apprehension, understandably, followed Mr Mbaka\u2019s recent exchange of words with a presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu, after the priest fell out with President Muhammadu Buhari and called for his resignation over the rising insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe angry youth marched to the bishop\u2019s residence in the city and vandalised a section of the property on suspicion that the Bishop, Callistus Onaga, who had summoned Mr Mbaka to a meeting, may have handed over the fiery priest to security officials.\n\nThe bishop caused what happened \u2013 Mbaka\n\nMr Mbaka has, however, blamed the bishop, Mr Onaga, for the vandalisation of the bishop\u2019s court.\n\nHe said the bishop ordered him \u201cto leave adoration ground, parish house and be on silence for 30 days\u201d, according to a report by the Vanguard newspaper.\n\nMr Mbaka said \u201cif the bishop had listened to his pleas that they should allow him to go back to the adoration ground to attend a scheduled programme and then use the opportunity to inform the worshippers that he would be holding house prayers for 30 days, the destruction done to the property would not have happened.\u201d\n\nMr Mbaka made the remark while addressing a jubilant crowd of supporters in Enugu after his reappearance.\n\n\u201cI appreciate your patience, endurance, incomparable love, unquestionable solidarity and unique identification and commitment to God in this ministry.\n\n\u201cGod will keep you, bless you and it shall be well with you. You people have been looking for me, look at me here,\u201d Mr Mbaka told the crowd.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t with my phone because I decided to go in to pray to avoid dissonance at that time.\n\n\u201cThe miracle is that at the time I was with my phone calls were coming from here and there that you people were heading to Bishop\u2019s court and Cathedral. Immediately I asked the group that I spoke with to ask you to go back. They insisted that they must see me otherwise they will not go. I spoke with them on video call but never knew they are over 47 groups.\n\n\u201cI thought that having blessed the first group that they have gone. It was at that moment that I started receiving calls. I told them I cannot go anywhere unless I hear from my Bishop.\n\n\u201cI thank God you have never attacked the wrong people. The DSS was not involved in what happened. But the Bishop gave an order that I should not come here from today. I should leave adoration house, parish house, that there will be no programme here for 30 days and I should stay silence for 30 days. So, I am telling you the truth of what happened.\u201d\n\nThe priest said when the bishop learnt of the vandalisation that was going on he told him to go address the youth and take them to the adoration ground.\n\n\u201cWhen Bishop asked me to go and take you people back to Adoration, I asked him what happened now because you told me that I am going to stay away and silence for 30 days?\n\n\u201cThen, he said I should go first and tell you people to go because things are getting worst (sic).\n\n\u201cThis is why people should understand how God works. I never disobeyed the church. People are busy misquoting me doing everything to close this ministry but by the grace of God they cannot do anything\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMbaka a disgruntled contract-seeker \u2013 Presidential spokesperson\n\nThe presidential spokesperson, Mr Shehu, had described Mr Mbaka as disgruntled contract-seeker after the priest called for President Buhari\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe priest did not deny discussing the contract award with the administration officials, but said he did it with the intention of helping to find a solution to Nigeria\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said he had introduced three unnamed men to the administration, during Mr Buhari\u2019s first term, with the hope that \u201cthey would help them in conquering insecurity, (since) they have the platform to end the insecurity in this country in under one month\u201d.\n\nIt is most likely that Mr Onaga, in asking Mr Mbaka \u201cto be in silence for 30 days\u201d, was looking for means to tackle the controversy between the priest and the presidency.\n\nMr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry operates independently, outside the control of the authorities of the Catholic Church.",

Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration has for vulnerable groups, such as women, girls and children, expressed optimism that the committee \u201cwill give a fresh and very impactful impetus to this clear government mantra towards the protection and preservation of the human dignity of everyone regardless of gender, status or age\u201d.\n\nMembers of the committee include the Commissioner for Gender Affairs and Social Development, Rt. Hon.

Saleh maintained that the claim was untrue.\n\nThe statement reads in parts: \u201cThe attention of the parents of the 39 abducted Afaka students has been drawn to a screaming headline in today\u2019s (May 5, 2021) publication of Roots TV to the effect that one of us (name withheld), who spoke to them in a live interview, claimed that we, the parents of the abducted students, contributed and paid the sum of N800,000 naira to a Fulani man through Sheikh Gumi for the release of our children.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state in no unclear terms that the claim has no basis in fact. Though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, but her claim is untrue.\n\nThe woman is not a member of the committee representing the affected parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the Forum of the Abducted Parents has never gathered money and given to Gumi or to someone through the revered Islamic scholar at anytime. We therefore dissociate ourselves from the statement.\n\nThe committee considers the statement as unfortunate and an unnecessary distraction from its commitment to secure the release of their children who have now spent 56 days in captivity.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the committee representing the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students visited the home of Sheikh Gumi to seek his intervention for the release of our children, but he declined, on the grounds that as a law-abiding citizen he would not want to go against the position of the state government which has forbidden anyone to negotiate with bandits.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the esteemed Sheikh for any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\n\n\u201cAgain we call on all to join their voices in calling on government at state and federal levels to work extra hard to ensure the safe release of our children so that they may be reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cWhile we await God\u2019s intervention for the release of our children, we call on all people of goodwill to join us in prayers as we continue to seek God\u2019s help for the release of our children,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, circumstances surrounding the release of the students remain unclear.\n\nThe students were kidnapped in March, but 11 were earlier freed.\n\nOne of the affected parents confirmed that they were released at a village in Giwa Local Government Area of the state and that they were on their way to Kaduna, as at the time of going to press.\n\nThe Kaduna Police Command has reported to the State Government, the release of the remaining students, the second security update, Wednesday revealed.\n\nAccording to a statement by internal security and Home Affairs commissioner, Mr Samuel Aruwan, the government rejoices with the freed students, their families and the management of the institution over this development.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai charged them to view their ordeal as a motivator to put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead.

This meeting, therefore, affords an opportunity to look into the provision for the armed forces.\n\n\u201cLet us take stock of the needs of the military and see if the supplementary budget might address that issue. So, it is an opportunity we can explore.\n\nMrs. Ahmed noted: \u201cBut, let me quickly say, as a matter of fact, that in 2019, 19.6billion was budgeted for capital, and 12.84billion was released which amounted to 64.37 percent.\n\nIn 2020, 34.37billion was allocated and that allocation was released 100 percent. In 2021, as at May ending, out of the 29billion budgeted, 17.98billion representing 61.92 percent disbursement and we are expecting to achieve 100 percent disbursement too, for 2021.\n\n\u201cFor overhead, in 2019, out of the budgeted amount of 15.64billion, 14.299billion was released, which represents 91.01 percent.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, overhead was 20.63billion and releases was 20.471billion, representing 99.21 percent, and for the current year 2021, in the last three months, out of the budgeted overhead of 20.63billion, the sum of 4.99billion has been released, which is 96.75 percent prorated for three months.\n\nThe Service chiefs represented by their various Heads of Accounts and Budget were present at the hearing, and all confirmed the details and the figures presented by the Honourable Minister.\n\nThe presentation and clarifications by Mrs. Ahmed were based on the news making the rounds that the military is being underfunded.\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman, senate committee on defense, Sentor Ali Ndume said \u201cIn the past couple of months, the security challenge in the country has reached an alarming level, with series of banditry and kidnappings in the northern part of Nigeria, and killing of officers and security personnel and arson in the South.\n\n\u201cThis committee, therefore, is desirous of an immediate action to stem the tide. We are worried about the news from the military that resources are not made available for them to prosecute their operations.\n\nWe are, therefore, worried that Nigeria has not been so bad; citizens and communities now do deals with bandits to safeguard their lives and communities,\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Accounts and Budget, Nigerian Army, Major General Adekunle Adigun Adesope, said that in his 30 years in the Army, 2020 was a milestone for him, because that was the first time that he saw 100 percent disbursement to the military.\n\nHe commended the support of Mr. President and the Minister in providing funding to the military.\n\nHe, however, appealed for more funding, because what is appropriated to the military, according to him, is inadequate.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has claimed President Muhammadu Buhari and his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan paid ransoms to kidnappers.\n\nObasanjo made the bombshell statement when he received members of Tiv Professionals Group (TPG) at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Wednesday.\n\nObasanjo said not just the Buhari administration but that of former President Goodluck Jonathan negotiated with kidnappers.\n\n\u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they deny it,\u201d he said.\n\nObasanjo urged the government to develop a means to deal with kidnappers and bandits, instead of pampering them with ransom payment.\n\n\u201cSome people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly.\n\n\u201cHe is a folly. This is because when you pay ransom, you encourage. But if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d he said.\n\nRumours of ransom payment had emerged in several negotiations between the Buhari administration and Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThere were also speculations of ransom payments in negotiations between state governments and terrorists.\n\nThe Buhari government was said to have paid ransom to secure the release of both the Chibok and the Dapchi schoolgirls.\n\nThe Chibok schoolgirls were kidnapped on 14 April 2014 during Jonathan\u2019s era.\n\nBut four years later, Buhari had his own dose of kidnapping, when the Dapchi girls were captured in February 2018 in Yobe state.\n\nLess than a month after, the girls were released, with one of them, Leah Sharibu held back.\n\nRansom was suspected, but the Buhari administration vehemently denied it.\n\nA UN report in August 2018 also disclosed \u2018large ransom payment\u2019 to ISWAP, but Information Minister denied. He said what government paid was a promise of \u2018ceasefire\u2019.\n\nWith more kidnapping targeting students in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states, President Buhari in February publicly denounced ransom.\n\nInstead, he urged states and security agencies to be more proactive in preventing abductions.\n\nHe warned state governors on the dangers of rewarding armed bandits stating that such policies can be disastrous.\n\n\u201cState Governments must review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles. Such a policy has the potential to backfire with disastrous consequences\u201d, Buhari said.\n\n\u201cStates and Local Governments must also play their part by being proactive in improving security in & around schools.\n\n\u201cLet bandits, kidnappers and terrorists not entertain any illusions that they are more powerful than the government.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t mistake our restraint for the humanitarian goals of protecting innocent lives as a weakness or a sign of fear or irresolution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna governor Nasir El-Rufai agreed with the President as he has vowed not to pay a dime to terrorists holding people hostage.\n\nHe has advocated a policy of annihilating the terrorists, saying the only thing they deserve is death.\n\nObasanjo on Wednesday suggested a carrot and stick approach in dealing with insecurity and terrorism, although he did not elaborate.\n\nAccording to reports, Obasanjo was instrumental in the release of the 27 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State.\n\n*With reports by Daily Trust",

It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30, 000 which right now, cannot even buy a bag of rice.\n\n\u201cThe proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay!\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the multiple devaluation of the Naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria has knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across board.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth. Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NLC, the call for salary slash by the minister is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers\u201d.\n\nWabba added: \u201cIt is most uncharitable, most insensitive, most dehumanising and most barbaric. Nigerian workers demand an immediate retraction and apology by the minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the minister of Finance to order now before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements. If there is any salary that needs serious slashing it is the humungous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders in Nigeria who do very little but collect so much!\n\n\u201cWorkers generate surplus value and revenue for government. We do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance! It is also important to make the point that salaries are products of contracts governed by laws. They cannot be unilaterally adjusted.\n\n\u201cWhile many countries of the world are increasing the salaries of their workforce, extending social security coverage for their citizens and providing all forms of palliatives to help their people through the terrible socio-economic dislocations occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be completely absurd for the Nigerian government to be thinking of salary slash.\n\n\u201cThis move is not only at great odds with global best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also in violation of relevant ILO Conventions and Declarations on Wages and Decent Work.\n\n\u201cWe urge Government as a social partner to quickly respond to the demands by Labour for an upward review of salaries of all Nigerian workers. Nigerian workers have showed sufficient understanding with government through the tough patches of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNow, Nigerian workers demand reciprocity of our understanding. Nigerian workers demand an increase in their remunerations and allowances.\u201d",

          "text": "The Catholic Diocese of Enugu has suspended Ejike Mbaka from church activities for one month, Peoples Gazette can report, as the controversial priest\u2019s political escapades continue to overshadow his theological obligations on a scale that nurtures unending concerns amongst his senior clerics.\n\nMr Mbaka was asked to proceed on suspension with effect from May 3 after being summoned by Callistus Valentine Onaga, the diocesan bishop. Mr Onaga called Mr Mbaka in following his repeated clashes with President Muhammadu Buhari and warned that his conduct was smearing the image of the church, the largest of any Christian organisation worldwide, church officials familiar with the matter told The Gazette.\n\nMost Rev. Dr. Callistus Valentine Onaga\n\nMr Mbaka sparred with Mr Buhari\u2019s aides in a series of verbal fireworks that included the Nigerian presidency threatening to blackmail the priest as a political jobber and public contract racketeer. Mr Mbaka denied the allegations.\n\nStill, Mr Onaga and other senior reverend fathers of the Enugu Diocese were compelled to step in and mitigate the unfolding public perception tumult that could have far-reaching consequences for the conventional but unofficial church and state relationship.\n\nThe church leaders recognised that Mr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry as an independent congregation that does not fall directly under the main church\u2019s control, he could still be reined in as a priest under the Roman Catholic\u2019s certification, officials said.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Mr Mbaka returned to his ministry that lies north of the outskirts of Enugu city centre, where he subsequently incited his members against the bishop, sources said.\n\nMr Mbaka\u2019s followers claimed without evidence that he was kidnapped by Mr Onaga and handed over to the State Security Service. They subsequently marched on the premises of the bishop on Wednesday morning, looting and destroying assets therein.\n\nThe mob also descended on the Holy Ghost Cathedral, again looting and destroying items in the building. The members also went to town to allege that the SSS had arrested Mr Mbaka \u2014 generating widespread media reports despite lacking requisite corroboration. The Gazette did not publish the claim.\n\nA spokesman for the SSS denied taking Mr Mbaka into custody or coming in any contacts with him when reached by The Gazette, contrary to his followers\u2019 rumours.\n\nA spokesman for the diocese did not immediately return a request seeking comments. Mr Mbaka\u2019s line was switched off when dialled by The Gazette on Wednesday night.\n\nBefore falling out with Mr Buhari recently, Mr Mbaka was an ardent supporter of the president. He endorsed his campaign in 2015 and claimed his blessings played a role in its success.\n\nBut as Mr Buhari\u2019s regime failed to tackle acute poverty and insecurity, Mr Mbaka said he was compelled to speak up and distance himself from his regime, describing it as evil and satanic and calling on the president himself to vacate office.\n\nBuhari and Mbaka\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s controversial spokesman Garba Shehu subsequently issued a statement, claiming Mr Mbaka\u2019s comments were out of anger for his unsuccessful attempts to corner lucrative federal contracts. The priest denied the allegations but confirmed that he recommended a group of security contractors to the president whose proposals were not acted upon.\n\nChurch sources said Mr Mbaka\u2019s latest suspension was being viewed as significant for its undertone, but not the first time the fiery priest would face administrative action.\n\n\u201cWe know people will link this to his confrontation with Buhari, but he was once demoted from a parish priest to a deputy under a parish priest,\u201d a church official said. \u201cHe had also been transferred from bigger parishes to smaller ones for his frequent infractions in the past.\u201d\n\nStill, church officials admitted Mr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry has been a cash cow for the Enugu Diocese, even though it was built by Mr Mbaka and not directly under its control.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is the Diocese has been financially dependent on Mbaka, collecting his millions,\u201d a source said, adding that some of the senior clerics themselves have also been in bed with politicians whom Mr Mbaka has long railed against.",

He is a folly.\n\n\u201cThis is because when you pay ransom, you encourage; but if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe added, \u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during (Goodluck) Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they denied it.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who condemned the security challenges in the country, insisted that 2023 must mark a watershed for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe year 2023 should give us the beginning of the emergence of a new federation. Feeling that the rot continues, then we are going to be sliding back to a ground dissolution. God forbid,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting It Right\n\nObasanjo decried that those beating drums of division in the country do not think about the interest of the minority ethnic groups.\n\nHe explained that the minority ethnic groups face oppression and extermination should Nigeria be allowed to break as being agitated by some people.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we will get it right in Nigeria, any leader must look at Nigeria with the prism of the diversity of Nigeria. For as long as you look at Nigeria with the prism of your ethnic group, then you are not going anywhere, either your ethnic group or religious group.\n\n\u201cBut is there hope? There is hope,\u201d the elder statesman stated.\n\nIn his remarks, Professor Gundu told informed his host that people were being maimed in their sleep and on their ancestral land, stressing the need for influential Nigerians to rise to the occasion to stem the tide of killings in the land.\n\n\u201cNigeria seems to be losing the battle against insecurity,\u201d he said while demanding full compensation for victims of killings and destruction in Tiv land.\n\nThe leader of the delegation also sought the proscription of armed Fulani groups and intensified advocacy against nomadic pastoralism.\n\n\u201cThere are different shades of instability in the country. Nigeria is truly bleeding to death. There\u2019s even a population fault line that could lead to the \u2018Lebanon Trap\u2019.\n\n\u201cAll patriots must stand together; but if others have to be enslaved before the country can survive, we will prefer, as Tiv people, to take our destiny in our hands,\u201d he said.",

Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Labour, the call for salary slash by the Minister is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers.",

          "text": "Anti-government protests took place across Colombia for the eighth straight day on Wednesday, as rights groups continue to raise concerns about excessive violence by security forces.\n\nRiot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators from the main public square in the capital, Bogota, at around 3pm (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday, as well as in other parts of the city where people had assembled.\n\nBut the protesters have said they will continue to take to the streets, despite right-wing President Ivan Duque withdrawing the contentious tax reform that pushed them to protest in the first place last week.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019ve withdrawn the reform, but they haven\u2019t changed it,\u201d said 48-year-old emerald trade union worker, Olga Cabos, who took part in the second national strike since April 28 in downtown Bogota.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let this government of Duque continue to keep making things harder for the poorest of us,\u201d she told Al Jazeera, brandishing an anti-government placard.\n\nThe protests were sparked by an unpopular tax reform that the government said aimed to stabilise an economy ravished by the coronavirus pandemic. But working- and middle-class Colombians said the plan favoured the rich while placing more pressure on them.\n\nDuque withdrew the proposal on Sunday and his finance minister resigned a day later, but the protesters are now calling for a withdrawal of a proposed health reform and a guaranteed basic income of one million pesos ($260) for all Colombians, among other demands.\n\n\u201cAlthough the tax reform was the initial spark, current protests in Colombia reflect a wide range of social, political and economic grievances that the Duque government will be hard-pressed to address with existing scripts for national dialogue,\u201d said Arlene Tickner, a political science professor at Bogota\u2019s Rosario University.\n\nViolence increased late on Monday in the country\u2019s third-largest city, Cali, where protesters said police opened fire to disperse the crowds. Videos of police misconduct in Cali \u2013 which Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify \u2013 were shared widely on social media on Tuesday.\n\nOn-the-ground sources said police indiscriminately shot at demonstrators, even from helicopters.\n\nThe death toll related to the protests remains widely disputed and wide-ranging between the government and independent NGOs. Colombia\u2019s human rights ombudsman says 24 people have died, while local NGO Temblores, which documents police abuse, estimates that 37 have been killed.\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest against President Ivan Duque\u2019s government in Medellin [Joaquin Sarmiento/AFP]\n\nThere have been reports of looting and vandalism during some of the protests and those acts have been condemned by local politicians.\n\nDisturbances worsened in Bogota on Tuesday evening, with 30 civilians and 16 police officers injured, the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement, adding that a mob tried to \u201cburn alive\u201d 10 police officers by setting fire to a small police station.\n\nMeanwhile, various United States officials, the United Nations and the European Union have denounced the national police force for opening fire on demonstrators. Celebrities, including Colombia-born musician Shakira \u2013 who has been known to steer clear of commenting on political issues \u2013 have also spoken out about the violence.\n\n\u201cI ask the government of my country to take urgent measures now to stop the violation of human rights and restore the value of human life above any political interest,\u201d the singer tweeted in Spanish on Tuesday.\n\nBut according to Tickner, \u201cgrowing international pressure to stop police brutality and respect human rights has had little effect on state-executed violence and accountability\u201d so far.\n\nIn a video on Wednesday, Duque repeated government allegations that illegal armed groups are engaging in acts of vandalism and looting and he said more than 550 arrests had been made.\n\n\u201cThere will be no truce with those who commit these crimes \u2013 all of society will take them to justice,\u201d Duque said.\n\nThe president had earlier urged a national dialogue \u201cto listen and construct solutions\u201d ahead of the marches, similar to that of 2019, when Colombians had taken to the streets over economic inequality, a slow implementation of the peace process and rising insecurity.\n\nElizabeth Dickinson, a senior Colombia analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that although illegal groups may have in some cases infiltrated the current protests, \u201cthere is no way you could credibly claim that any armed or criminal group is motivating or coercing protesters to the street\u201d.\n\n\u201cHere in the capital Bogota, the number of people living in extreme poverty has tripled in just a year, so this is a real moment of social crisis across the country and I think the protests could be more enduring than in 2019.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Sergio Guzman, a political analyst who runs the firm Colombia Risk Analysis, said many of the protesters\u2019 demands are unrealistic \u2013 and will not be welcomed by the Duque government.\n\n\u201cDemands such as universal basic income are not feasible under any scenario,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, adding that the protesters have yet to establish a negotiating position that would be considered realistic or acceptable by the government, either.\n\nHowever, he said the government needs to start addressing more of the protesters\u2019 concerns, especially police brutality.\n\nDickinson agreed and also said both sides are currently very entrenched in their positions.\n\n\u201cProtesters\u2019 demands are really growing by the day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a list of very significant changes for the state and for right or wrong, they would entail very significant, deep reforms to the way that the state functions.\u201d",

The first one is the award of a contract for design, manufacturing and supply of critical spare parts for Crompton Greaves 330 kV, 132 kV and 33 kV circuit breakers to Messrs. Legen Engineering Nigeria Limited in the sum of N298,339,887.04.\n\n\u201cThe second one is the award of the contract for the procurement of 50 sets of 400 AH battery banks, 30 to 50 volts and 30 number of 110-volt battery charges for the substation used by the TCN in favour of Messrs. DTS Transformers Electric Industry Limited at the sum of N644,805,953.10.\n\n\u201cThe third award of the contract is for the procurement of 50 cents also of 132 kV isolators for the TCN in favour of Messrs. Leading Diagonal Engineering Nigeria Limited in the sum of $840,650 plus N53,900,000 within the delivery period of six months.\n\n\u201cThe fourth one is the award of the contract for the design, manufacturing and the supply of three 60/66 MVA 132kV power transformers with accessories and 15 number of 500 kV transformers, 33/0.415kV earthing transformers for the TCN in favour of Messrs. Zhenjiang Transformers Company Limited, in the sum of N1,296,953,044.55 with a delivery period of 12 months.\n\n\u201cThe fifth one is the award of the contract for the design, supply and installation of Optical Wire (OPGW) and Universal Optical Transportation Network System (OTN) for some critical transmission lines in favour of Messrs. Xinjiang Power and Transportation Company Limited in the sum of $6,800,743.51, plus N668,843,634.74, with a delivery period of 12 months.\n\n\u201cThe last one is the upward review of the contraction for the design, manufacture, supply, installation and commissioning of 1X 100MVA, 132/33kV power transformers at Ogba Transmission Substation, Lagos, in favour of Messrs. Power Control and Appliances Limited, in the sum of $648,038.31, plus N48,342,524.18, with the delivery period of six months.\n\n\u201cAll these procurements are geared towards upgrades of the transmission system, to the national grid, so that we can have sufficient power supply to the nation\u201d.\n\nThe minister added that the federal government will soon begin the second phase of the free distribution of four million pre-paid electricity meters to Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government is almost through with the distribution of one million free pre-free paid meters to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe have almost finished with phase zero, we are now going into phase one of the distribution of the meters, that is the remaining four million the central bank promised to augment with.\n\n\u201cThe first set is one million, we are about to finish with that, but you know, it is not the target, one million is very negligible compared to the demand of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if there was any improvement in power generation, Saleh said: \u201cWe are improving, it (power generation) has improved, you can see, I don\u2019t have to tell you.\n\n\u201cWe are moving from 3,000 megawatts, today we are generating up to 5,000 megawatts or over that, so it is a great improvement.\u201d\n\nThe minister stated that government was making sure that power supply was stable and also working towards upgrading the supply \u201cfrom say 4000 megawatts to 5,000 to 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts and so on.\n\n\u201cSo, the more we replace some obsolete and outdated equipment, the more we improve the supply of electricity.\u201d\n\nAsked if he agreed with the report that over 70 per cent of Nigerians who have electricity supply have less than 12 hours a day, he said: \u201cIt all depends. You know we have graded the supply based on the metering.\n\n\u201cUnless the meters are sufficient, we will not know which and where to push 24 hours supplies because there are some people who are ready for 24 hours and there are those who are not ready for 24 hours supply of light.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Organised labour under the auspices of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Wednesday condemned the moves by the federal government to review payrolls as part of measures to reduce the cost of governance.\n\nIt expressed concerns that the planned review, listed on Tuesday by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, as part of a directive by President Muhammed Buhari to cut costs in view of dwindling revenue may lead to slashing workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe NLC President, Dr. Ayuba Wabba, said in a statement yesterday that it would be absurd for the federal government to be thinking of a salary slash.\n\nHe said instead of contemplating a reduction in salaries, the government, as a social partner should respond to the demands by labour for an upward review of salaries.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIt was with huge shock that we read the statement credited to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who said that the federal government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers.\u201d\n\nNLC described the call for salary slash as a \u2018mass suicide\u2019 wish for Nigerian workers.\n\nIt demanded an immediate retraction and apology from the minister.\n\nThe NLC called on Buhari to \u201ccall the Minister of Finance to order now before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements.\u201d\n\nIt added that if any salary should be slashed, it was the humungous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders.\n\nNLC said it would be most unthinkable that the government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of workers at this time.\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is \u2018which salary is the government planning to slash? It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30,000, which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice! The proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay,\u201d it added.\n\nNLC said it was public knowledge that the multiple devaluation of the naira in a short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria had eroded the value of workers\u2019 incomes.\n\nAccording to the NLC, workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth.\n\nIt said: \u201cIndeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce a salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cWe do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance! It is also important to make the point that salaries are products of contracts governed by laws. They cannot be unilaterally adjusted.\n\n\u201cWhile many countries of the world are increasing the salaries of their workforce, extending social security coverage for their citizens and providing all forms of palliatives to help their people through the terrible socio-economic dislocations occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be completely absurd for the Nigerian government to be thinking of salary slash.\n\n\u201cThis move is not only at great odds with global best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also in violation of relevant ILO Conventions and Declarations on Wages and Decent Work.\n\n\u201cWe urge government as a social partner to quickly respond to the demands by labour for an upward review of salaries of all Nigerian workers. Nigerian workers have shown sufficient understanding with the government through the tough patches of the pandemic. Now, Nigerian workers demand reciprocity of our understanding. Nigerian workers demand an increase in their remunerations and allowances. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "title": "Agitations for Nigeria\u2019s Disintegration, Insensitive, Says Obasanjo",
          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo Wednesday described calls for the disintegration of Nigeria as unmindful and insensitive to the plight of the minority groups in the country.\n\nThis is coming as the Ambassador of Republic of Korea to Nigeria, Mr. Kim Young Chae, has condemned the call by secessionists for the breakup of the country into several parts.\n\nSpeaking in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, when he received the Tiv Professional Group (TPG) from Benue State, who paid him a courtesy visit, Obasanjo recalled a discussion between him and \u201ca military friend.\u201d\n\nAccording to the former president, his friend had described the major tribes in the country as selfish and not sufficiently caring for the minority groups.\n\nObasanjo said he aligned with his friend\u2019s opinion and expressed worry over what would become of the minority groups if the major tribes decided to secede and operate as separate countries.\n\n\u201cIf the Yoruba can stand as a country; if the Igbos and the Hausa/Fulani can stand as separate countries, where do we want the minority groups to be?\n\n\u201cNow, by virtue of the present situation, they are a little bit protected but if Nigeria breaks up, they will be oppressed and exterminated,\u201d he added.\n\nObasanjo noted that when he had meetings with a number of socio-cultural organisations in September 2020, nobody at such meetings talked about disintegration or breakup, stressing that \u201call they clamoured for was a change for good.\u201d\n\nHe urged the Nigerian leaders to be mindful of the ethnic diversity of the Nigerian nation, adding that the country would not make any meaningful progress without such consideration.\n\nObasanjo, who expressed hope that the rough times that Nigeria was going through would not last forever, urged Nigerians to be patient while the country gathered her goodwill and moved in the right direction.\n\nThe leader of the group, Prof. Zacharys Gundv, in a paper he presented to Obasanjo, highlighted the challenges of the nation, including insecurity, poverty religious intolerance, kidnappings and banditry, among others.\n\nHe explained the Tivs were worried about the skewed narrative of insecurity in Nigeria\n\nIn a related development, the Ambassador of Republic of Korea to Nigeria, Mr. Kim Young Chae has condemned the call by secessionists for the breakup of the country into several parts.\n\nThe diplomat offered his reservation yesterday at a roundtable discussion with some journalists to mark his 100 days in office as the Korean Ambassador in Nigeria.\n\nKim described the idea of balkanisation of Nigeria as very dangerous, which could result in bloodshed and displacement of many communities by virtue of conflict that could result from such.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to continue to live in harmony, having intermarried and carried out a lot of activities together for over 100 years.\n\n\u201cThe call for the breakup of Nigeria is not a good idea. We had the Korean War in 1950 and more than one million people were killed. We also had the Biafran War in Nigeria and more than one million lives were lost. To divide a country means cutting your body. Let us imagine we have a whole body and I want to make my own body into two, then we have to cut some portions. And in the process I have to bleed a lot, not to wonder the pains and loss of blood,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cautioned that if Nigeria eventually splits into several parts, the smaller offshoots will become insignificant and irrelevant in the global stage, without any voice of note.\n\n\u201cNigeria right now is internationally well-acclaimed. The Korean candidate was defeated by a Nigerian candidate, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the post of Director-General of World Trade Organisation, which indicates that Nigeria is very strong at the diplomatic level. We also see many accomplished Nigerian nationals, notably Amina Mohammed at the UN and Akinwunmi Adesina at the African Development Bank making their presence felt on the global stage. Why you have so many high-ranking Nigerian policymakers at the global level is because Nigeria is a very relevant nation, otherwise, Okonjo-Iweala would not have been elected. In the event Nigeria is splintered into many countries, those countries won\u2019t be of relevance internationally\u201d.\n\nHe also warned of the cost implication of running the offshoot nations, like building new army and institutions like the presidency, new embassies and the civil service.\n\nKim also bemoaned decrease in bilateral trade volume between Nigeria and Korea.\n\nHe said last year trade between both countries was $1.2 billion, which was a sharp decline from the $2.6 billion transactions in 2017.\n\nHe attributed the slide to the fall in the global price of oil and gas, noting the fall negatively affected the two nations\u2019 bilateral trade volume.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",
