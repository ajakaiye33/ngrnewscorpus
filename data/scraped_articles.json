          "text": "RESIDENTS of Polo, one of the communities in Maiduguri attacked by Boko Haram insurgents in Borno State on Tuesday, have said that the terrorist deliberately did not fire any gunshot at them, even when they came close to them with their gun trucks.\n\nThe residents explained that the terrorists attacked the military formation in the area.\n\nThe insurgents had carried out the surprise attack on Jiddari Polo at about 5.30pm, killing three soldiers and setting several houses ablaze in their attempt to upset the festive mood in the area.\n\nThe insurgents attacked Jiddari Polo killing three soldiers and setting ablaze houses and cars in the process.\n\nThe insurgents, according to witnesses around Jiddari Polo, drove into Maiduguri from the northern axis which connects to Sambisa forest in motorcycles and gun trucks, shooting sporadically into the air to scare away residents.\n\nOne of the residents, Asabe Titus, narrated her experience, saying, \u201cThe insurgents drove into the community in their motorcycles, gun trucks and some on foot shooting sporadically into the air without aiming at anybody.\n\n\u201cWe started running out of our houses and then we saw them coming in from the cashew plantation area, they didn\u2019t shoot at us. Some of them were dressed in red, others in black mufti. They said they didn\u2019t come for us and that we should not run.\n\n\u201cWhile we were running for our lives, the Boko Haram terrorists were right behind us, shooting sporadically. Truth be told, if they had meant to kill civilians, they would have killed many because they were already in the community and nobody expected them.\n\n\u201cSome of them headed to the military formation located there while others went into town and set houses on fire. I think they burnt down three houses and cars. They even made away with several cars\n\n\u201cThey killed three soldiers but the Nigerian troops killed scores of them. I can\u2019t give the accurate numbers because the army had cleared all corpses before day break and they have been chasing us away from the scene of the attack.\u201d Another resident of Jidda Polo, Ibrahim Mohammed, said, \u201cThe insurgents got into the town quite okay but they didn\u2019t kill any civilian. We have to give credit to the crack team; they came in and neutralised the insurgents. I was in my house as of the time of the attack. I was alerted by the sound of gunshots.\n\n\u201cIt was the police crack team that dealt the insurgents heavy casualties.\n\nWhen they came in as reinforcement, they took on the insurgents head on, chasing them in their Hilux vans,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Nigeria deserves world-class healthcare system",
          "text": "By Odewale Abayomi\n\nSIR: In the build-up to the now-historic 2015 general elections, President Muhammadu Buhari, who was running against the then-incumbent president, promised to end medical tourism for government officials. Contrary to that promise, Buhari has gone to the United Kingdom on a sixth trip since assuming power.\n\nThe sixth trip coincided with a general strike by a doctors\u2019 union in the country. The National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) downed tools to protest poor remuneration and unfavourable conditions of service. The Nigerian healthcare system has been in a state of disrepair for decades, leading to the late General Sani Abacha, a former head of state, quipping in 1984 that Nigeria\u2019s hospitals are mere consulting clinics.\n\nHealth care facilities across the country are neglected, and the poor bear the brunt by having no choice but to patronise the decrepit, ill-equipped and underfunded healthcare centres. What is not recognised is that the government\u2019s negligence violates a fundamental right to accessible health care.\n\nIn a half-hearted bid to make healthcare available to all and sundry, former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan in 2014, enacted Nigeria\u2019s National Health Act (NHAct) which prescribes a legal structure for the regulation, development, and management of Nigeria\u2019s health system. With inclusive Universal Health Coverage, everybody can get quality health services whenever they need them, without suffering costing an arm. Sadly, the laudable act has been abandoned.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Basic Health Care Fund (BHCPF), an offshoot of NHAct, is meant to substantially increase revenue allocated to improving Primary Health Care, with a sustainable mechanism of removing financial barriers to accessing primary healthcare. BHCPF comes from not less than one per cent Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) and contributions from donor grants.\n\nIf put in place, the BHCPF will increase access to healthcare for the poor. Sadly, the 2018 Health access quality index rated Nigeria in the lowest rung of health indicators. Nigeria is ranked 187 out of 195 countries, despite the government earmarking N55 billion for BHCPF in 2018.\n\nIn 2021, only 4.526 per cent (N592.166 billion) of the proposed N13.082 trillion of the budget has been allocated to the health sector, the bulk of which goes into recurrent expenditure. This proposal means that most of the money would go into the system\u2019s administration and not improve it. Especially when Nigeria battles Covid-19 pandemic, this is a far cry from the 15% of annual budget set by African Union countries.\n\nBesides, Section 3(4) of the NHAct, appears ambiguous. It states that: \u201c\u2026 all Nigerians shall be entitled to a guaranteed minimum package of services.\u201d The federal government should spell out the minimum package in clear terms. If the NHAct is fully implemented and operationalised, it promises to protect Nigerians\u2019 right to health.\n\nThe government can also leverage on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), a long-term contract with risk-sharing to expand access to quality healthcare delivery, especially in remote areas.\n\nFor instance, the PPP between the Abbott Fund and the Government of Tanzania greatly assisted in modernising facilities, training staff, improving hospital, patient management, and HIV/AIDS testing and treatment at over 90 hospitals and rural health clinics across Tanzania. So far, Abbott Fund has invested more than US$50 million.\n\nIn Nigeria, the feat can be replicated. A coalition of public and private partners can collaborate on primary health facilities, medicine, diagnostic centres, treatment, research, among others.",

With our situation of total unpreparedness, we can only hope and pray that we will be spared the consequences of our lack of adequate preparation.\n\nWhat is happening in India, the centre of vaccines manufacturing in the world has ramifications for the developing countries that receive vaccines pro bono from the World Health Organization (WHO) because of our impecunious situation caused by stealing of national resources and mismanagement and poor governance in most of African countries where state capture by a few well-connected local and or external forces is the order of the day. This has invariably benefited the ruling and colluding elite. If Nigeria were well governed, we should not be waiting for handouts from the WHO or any external bodies. But alas, this is the situation in Africa with the exception of South Africa which has the infrastructure to manufacture on license, vaccines against coronavirus. I suppose when we witness the oncoming catastrophe in our country, we will probably run to China for the vaccines of Sinopharm which has proved totally ineffective in Brazil. While on the issue of Chinese vaccines, I am totally confused about how the Chinese have managed to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic which started in Wuhan China. Apart from the initial closure of areas affected by the virus in China, there has been no other extraordinary measures taken by the Chinese. Some have suggested that the draconian measure taken by the Chinese could only have been adopted by a Communist country with its centralized planning, policing and control of all levers of power. Whatever the Chinese have done, one must admire them. The Chinese economy in the last year has grown by 12% which is incredible when compared with the negative nose-diving growth of western economies. This is why some cynics are saying the coronavirus pandemic was unleashed on the world as part of Chinese strategy to be the numero uno among the world powers. Whatever the case may be, the Indian situation probably indicates the fault lines in democracy in a large and highly populated country where perhaps strong governments are needed rather than parliamentary debates which are the hall mark of democratic governance. In our case in Nigeria, we suffer from the double jeopardy of weak governance and autocracy and state capture by a small ethnic and religious cohort.\n\nWhen we got the first batch of Covax vaccines from the WHO, states were given their shares according apparently on the basis of incidence of the disease and ready infrastructure to administer the vaccines. Lagos, the entry point of the coronavirus to Nigeria got half a million doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccines for its close to 20 million inhabitants. Other states got measly amount from the two million doses of the vaccines.\n\nSpecial allocations were made to members of the armed forces, of course these were for officers only while the rank and file would have to wait until the next batch. I don\u2019t know if the police got any allocations. The allocations to the states were given to the higher members of the bureaucracy, state and federal, who got the jabs in their arms and allocations were made to the judiciary and the federal and state legislatures.\n\nTo my surprise, nothing was given to teachers, at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Now the schools including universities have been asked to open. What will happen to teachers and professors and the students in their cramped dormitories, halls of residence and classrooms? What about the old professors who should have been part of those to receive priority consideration ab initio? It is of course true that the number of vaccines given to us as a country was too small. This two million total allocation to Nigeria\u2019s 200 million amounts to one hundredth of our need.\n\nNo one should blame the WHO for not giving us more. It can only give us out what it had. In fact, the WHO had to blackmail the rich world which was hoarding the vaccines with the USA and Canada having more vaccines than they would ever need. The rich country did what was in the interest of their people. It is natural to protect yourself before thinking of others. Even the Holy scriptures say love your neighbors as yourselves not more than yourselves. It was when the rich countries realized that no one would be safe until all are safe before they climbed down from their high horses of vaccines nationalism and began to accede to WHO request to help the poor people of the world. It is of course a pity that Nigeria and the rest of Africa wear the badge of poverty as an honor. But in reality, Nigeria should not belong to the category of poor nations if we had managed our resources well. Countries that are members of OPEC are generally not considered poor. It was a herculean task persuading the rest of the world that Nigeria was a poor country when we were campaigning for debt forgiveness while suffering from the debt overhang. Unfortunately, this present government has taken us back to debt peonage where our children and grandchildren will be domiciled even when we are gone.\n\nAnother problem we have in Nigeria is vaccines hesitancy. Some of our clerics, Muslim and Christian are even telling their flock that coronavirus only affect sinners and unbelievers and frown at wearing masks. Some illiterates are also saying it is a disease of the rich and affluent and the preaching about physical distancing, masking and avoiding of large congregations are falling on deaf ears in a country where poverty has driven our people to churches and mosques of charlatans who are exploiting and deceiving the gullible people.\n\nI of course know that the African Union is rumored to have placed orders for 400 million of the Johnson and Johnson vaccines even though South Africa has previously rejected them on the grounds of their ineffectiveness to combat the coronavirus variant in their country. This variant has spread to the Southern, Central and Eastern African regions. It is only a matter of time before it spreads to West Africa including Nigeria if it has not done that already. Even if the 400 million of Johnson and Johnson vaccines which require only one jab rather than the two jabs of Astra Zeneca jabs are delivered hopefully by next year, one wonders if they will work since they did not work against the South African variant. The date of delivery means we will probably all be dead by that time as predicted by the Anglican Bishop of Cape Town in South Africa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is the issue of those who have already received the first jab of Astra Zeneca vaccines and waiting for the second jab which India has now embargoed because of the surging coronavirus in their country. It\u2019s a case of charity beginning at home. There is no scientific backing for mixing vaccines. One just hopes that the Nigerian government would plead with the United States and the British governments to release some of the stockpiles of the Astra Seneca vaccines in their possession.\n\nThe science of vaccines production is not totally alien to our country. In the 1970s vaccines of one type or the other against small pox, trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness and other diseases were produced in Vom on the Plateau. The current coronavirus vaccines may be different but certainly we could move from our previous knowledge of vaccines production to the new sophisticated computer driven ones if the resources were made available for researchers and if the infrastructure were kept up to date. But like everything we do in our import-dependent country, we have abandoned even our previous knowledge for imports in every aspect of our lives. We are now importing New Jersey cows to produce milk when in fact in the 1950s and 1960s, we were drinking fresh cow milk in Ibadan!\n\nOur problems are legion. On one hand we are begging foreign countries to come and help us with our self-inflicted wounds of banditry, herders war against farmers, jihadist terrorism, secessionist agitation and demands for wholesale restructuring and now we are going to have to plead for vaccines! Unfortunately, we have no choice. This is the cross road in which we now find ourselves and we don\u2019t know where to turn to and remaining at this crossroads may be terminal for our existence. I shudder to imagine what will happen to us unless we make haste while the sun shines.",

          "text": "By Jide Oluwajuyitan\n\nLong after the declaration of Fulani herdsmen as the fourth deadliest terrorists\u2019 group in the world by the World Terrorist Index, those Nigerians who often play the ostrich and whose narrative is often promoted by the media are the same people who today assault our ears with talk of ethnic profiling. The identity of those who killed, maimed, confiscated farmlands and kidnap for ransom even before Sheik Gumi\u2019s recent declaration that \u201cgovernment know them, monitors them by air view\u201d, has never been in dispute. President Buhari\u2019s appeal to the people of Benue to tolerate the settlers in their midst during some of his condolence visits to the state after periodic massacres of farmers, women and children was but a confirmation the president knows those who have continued to make his job of nation building more arduous.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoth governors El Rufai of Kaduna and Massari of neighbouring Katsina that had at different occasions negotiated and paid ransom to bandits admitted many of them are Fulani immigrants from neigbouring countries. Those that were indicted for the attack on Olu Falae were Fulani. Those arrested for the killing Chief Executive Officer, Kunfayakun Green Treasures Limited, Fatai Aborode, near his farm along Apodun village in Oyo State, were herdsmen also belong to the same ethnic group.\n\nWhen Akeredolu issued a fatwa for those AK-47-wielding herdsmen who illegally took over Ondo forest reserve, Shehu Garba and Bauchi\u2019s Bala Mohammed came out not on behalf of Niger Delta militants but to defend Fulani herdsmen who they said are protected by the constitution to operate anywhere in Nigeria\u2019s forests. Jigawa and Kebbi state governors with large herdsmen population in January joined their six southwest governors to resolve the crisis.\n\nWhen elder statesman, Theophilus Danjuma fingered Fulani herdsmen as those killing and confiscating land in Adamawa State, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, then Emir of Kano and one the patrons of Miyyetti Allah, rather than deny the herdsmen\u2019s involvement, claimed hundreds of Fulani herdsmen killed earlier by their host communities were never reported by the newspapers.\n\nIn any case, nearly every harvest of deaths that accompany herdsmen attacks on communities, has been defended by Miyetti Allah spokesmen who have always described them as retaliatory attacks to avenge the killing of their men or rustling of their cattle.\n\nBut if ethnic profiling accusation will not wash, we can make a saint of killers and bandits by playing the ostrich. Speaking in Bauchi on Thursday, February 11, to Justify bearing of AK-47 rifles by herdsmen, Bauchi\u2019s Mohammed who condemned the treatment of Fulani herdsmen in the southern region, said herdsmen \u201chave inalienable right to defend themselves from cattle rustlers and other challenges encountered on the road\u201d adding \u201cit is not his fault, it is the fault of government and the people, the Fulani tribe is a constant target for eviction from local communities.\u201d\n\nGumi who revealed \u201cthe herdsmen-bandits are engaged in an ethnic war against other peoples and sedentary Fulani in the country\u201d was to complain that \u201cFulani are being profiled, killed by the military, lynched in town,\u201d adding. \u201cDo you know that there are situations where any man with this Fulani physique \u2013 slim, light-complexioned, even dark ones \u2013 on a motorbike is automatically arrested and incarcerated?\u201d\n\nFor their pains, Gumi wants herdsmen who he admitted are killers and kidnappers who are at war with Nigeria, provided with \u201creasonable means of livelihood including jobs, working capital, entrepreneurship training as well as clinics and school\u201d.\n\nNot left out are the governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, who wants \u201crepentant bandits\u201d to be granted amnesty by the federal government and Katsina State governor, Aminu Masari who with his policy of Dialogue and Amnesty Programme paid criminals millions only to visit more suffering on poor people of Katsina who were being forced to pay ransom to harvest their farm products.\n\nThey all chose to play the ostrich instead of telling immigrants and imported Fulani herdsmen that Nigeria is not owned by Fulani in spite of the current constitution, rigged against Nigerians by Nigerian military. Instead what we got was Bala Mohammed\u2019s arrogant assertion that \u201cwe cannot close border against Fulani, he is a global man, Fulani from Senegal to Nigeria, Cameroon, are Nigerians\u201d and Gumi\u2019s claim that \u201cFulani are in all Nigerian states, we cannot drive them away because they speak local Nigerian languages\u201d And living in denial, they tried to present those who engage in mindless killings, kidnapping of school children and other crimes against humanity as victims that deserve amnesty and resettlement like the Niger Delta militants of the Yar\u2019Adua era.\n\nHowever, history tells us that long before the current wave of immigrant and imported Fulani herdsmen who today daily visit terror on Nigerians, Fulani herdsmen had hardly been good guests. As proof, King Yunfa (1801-1808) of Gobir who hosted Uthman dan Fodio who later helped him into the throne, ended up losing his life and kingdom. The respected cleric and reformer followed up with the conquest of all the Hausa states installing only but one non-Fulani Emir in over a dozen Emirates he created for his fellow Fulani. It is instructive that not more than one pious Muslim could be found in the Hausa states that had embraced the Islamic faith about 400 years before the revered Jihadist and reformer came to Gobir.\n\nThe story of Afonja was not different. He lost his Ilorin throne and his life to Alimi, his Fulani guest that had earlier supported him in his revolt against Alafin of Oyo. Tafawa Balewa\u2019s biographer, Trevor Clark, in his A right Honourable Gentleman recorded Balewa\u2019s story of his grandmother who had wanted Fulani settlers expelled from their land or killed if they refused to relocate.\n\nThis is not to say other ethnic groups do not have their own demons. Yoruba talk of her superior culture and is held in disdain by Fulani for her overweening pride which makes her think the feudal lords need free education or egalitarian society. The Igbo think the god of Africa has ordained them to lead Africa, which forced Ahamadu Bello to observe that if you employ an Igbo man a labourer, he will aspire to become head of labourers and of course the Hausas are fatalistic which makes them see nothing wrong in becoming beggars in urban centres of the country while their Fulani overlords control their political economy and the Igbo buy up their lands all over the north.\n\nBut all is not lost in spite of our thousand demons. Our visionary founding fathers adopted a federal arrangement, the social system that allows each group to battle its own demon without a threat to other members of the federating nationalities. As Chinua Achebe puts in his No Longer At Ease, \u201cwe are strangers in this land, when calamity befalls the owners of the land, we move away leaving the owners of the land who know how to appease their own gods\u201d. The curse of our nation are our current political leaders. As the major beneficiaries of our current nightmare, there is neither political will nor incentive to go back to \u201cthe path to Nigerian freedom\u201d they rejected because of greed.",

I was alleged to have written a letter indicating that the appointments of one Muslim and three Christians should be balanced out.\n\n\u201cWe just finished fasting and I am saying before you that when they came to meet me, I insisted that the person that came first in the interview must be included. I didn\u2019t even know if the person was a Christian or a Muslim.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, those who know me know I don\u2019t consider religion in my appointments. My focus is always on merit, performance and delivery.\n\n\u201cSo, I challenge anyone that saw such a letter anywhere in the system either from me or the Attorney-General, to bring the letter out. I want to see it.\n\n\u201cWhen we went for the PDP, South-West Congress, the two powerful positions, which they gave to us \u2013 the zonal chairmanship and women leader slot, were occupied by Muslims and that was the recent thing we have done.\n\n\u201cIn building our state, the greatest challenges we have to fight are poverty and hunger because other things are directly under the two.

          "title": "Disquiet in NAMA over secret recruitments",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nThere is a massive air of suspense in the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) over the recent shortlisting of about 35 candidates to be trained and recruited as Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) with insiders alleging that majority of the shortlisted candidates were from northern part of the country and almost 18 allegedly from Katsina State.\n\nDaily Sun exclusively learnt that the recruitment process was not only said to be lopsided but also shrouded in secrecy following management\u2019s inability to advertise the vacanciesin line with the law establishing the Federal Character Commission which mandates that vacancies for positions in the Federal Civil Service be advertised in one Southern and one Northern paper for a period of six weeks.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that this was the first time such recruitment of ATCOs in particular was happening in NAMA. The source further said the workers were told that management was able to get approval from the Federal Character Commission because it was allegedly told that what was being done was \u2018not a recruitment but replacement.\u2019\n\nSections 14.3 and 14.4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) requires that there shall be no \u2018predominance of persons from a few states or ethnic or other sectional groups\u2019 in the Federal Government and its agencies. But sources within the agency alleged that it was the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, that sent in the list of the candidates that were shortlisted and accused him of running a \u2018one man show\u2019 by exerting undue control over the six agencies under his supervision.\n\n\u201cAmong those were shortlisted for training as ATCOs, only one or two were from the South East, about three were from the South West, while 18 were from Katsina where the Minister comes from. The remaining recruits were from the rest of the northern states,\u201d a source told Daily Sun.\n\nBarely two years ago, the aviation minister was accused of being responsible for a similar lopsided recruitment into the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) when the agency needed security officers in all airports especially Lagos, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Abuja.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that at the time, FAAN had concluded interviews in all the airports and wanted to give priority to those who were already working as causal staff in the different states because they were used to the terrain.\n\nBut an insider told Daily Sun that after FAAN had concluded the interviews for the candidates, \u201c the minister\u2019s list suddenly emerged from the blues with majority of candidates on the list from the north and about 400 from Katsina alone.\n\nUnfortunately, those interviewed by FAAN who were expecting their employment letters were jettisoned.\n\nAccording to them, although the minister\u2019s candidates didn\u2019t go through any interview, they were given appointment letters and told to camp. After they were redeployed to different states from Katsina, most of them couldn\u2019t cope. How can you carry a level four officer from Katsina to Port Harcourt, how would they cope financially? Most of them returned to Katsina and they are there doing nothing. They just go to their farms and collect salaries at the end of the month because Katisna doesn\u2019t have a busy airport. FAAN had to continue overusing those who were at the airports where we needed people.\u201d\n\nIn his response, AviationMinistry\u2019s Director of Media and Publicity, James Odaudu, categorically denied the allegations leveled against Sirika, telling Daily Sun that the minister is a stickler for due process and was neither responsible for recruitment into agencies nor ensuring that vacancies in NAMA are published in national dailies.\n\nMeanwhile there have been strong concerns over evaluation process in NAMA as the shortlisted candidates in NAMA was conducted on April 12 at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) and the result of the exercise has already been released. Though it is still being kept under wraps, insiders within the agency allege that the evaluation was faulty and didn\u2019t follow the due process that would ensure that very competent people are selected as ATCOs.\n\nOne of the issues raised is that most of those recruited are far above the age of 27 required for the position of a cadet in the Air Traffic Control Department. A source told Daily Sun that in the employment manual, it was stated there that a cadet should not be more than 27 years.\n\n\u201cIf they employ cadets at 25 and they go to Zaria for training for two years, by the time they are through, they will be around 27 or 28 but instead Human Resources employed people that are over 30 years old and by the time they are through with training, they will be about 35 to 37 years. Those who drew up that policy did it because a cadet is supposed to be a trainee. You don\u2019t get someone who by the time he is through with NCAT, will have been 35 to come and train under someone who is 27 years old. This is a critical department that deals with the safety of people\u2019s lives. You don\u2019t bring in elderly people that would not fit to do the job. That is just one of the many criteria of the evaluation process that was not met,\u201d the source said.\n\nDaily Sun also reliably learned from another senior management staff who is not authorised to speak on such matters, that the Nigerian Air Traffic Control Association (NATCA) and the Human Resource department have been at loggerheads over staff welfare and recruitment. The body wrote a letter to the management of the agency, expressing concern over the secretiveness of the entire recruitment process and was very worried that considering the very sensitive job of an ATCO (Air Traffic Controllers are responsible for directing the safe movement of aircraft arriving and departing from airports), the Association needed to be involved in the evaluation to ensure that the candidates meet all necessary requirements and only the best hands are selected.\n\n\u201cThe questions the HR should be asked are what were the criteria for the evaluation? Were proper aero medicals carried out to ensure that they are mentally and physically fit? Who conducted the evaluation? Was a committee which includes experienced ATCOs set up? Why was NATCA not involved in the process as had been the tradition in the past? Because of the safety implications of air travel and the very sensitive duties of ATCOs, the recruitment should have been made open so that more people can apply and the best shortlisted.\n\nTypically, the pass mark for ATCOs in any examination is 75 percent and even if candidate scores 74 percent, the person would be considered to have failed but they just orchestrated the evaluation process in such a way that will make it easy for most of the shortlisted candidates to scale through.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Prof. Usman Yusuf has said former President Olusegun Obasanjo, controversial Islamic cleric, Sheik Gumi and himself negotiated the release of the 27 abducted students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kagara, Kaduna State.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on Arise TV yesterday, he said the team ensured the release of the students where the Federal Government failed.\n\nYusuf, a professor of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation said no ransom was paid for the release of the students.\n\n\u201cThe first and only negotiations that Sheik Gumi and Obasanjo got involved in, Obasanjo was emphatic that no ransom will be paid and we succeeded in doing that where the government failed. No money exchanged hands in the negotiations, no shot was fired and no life was lost. We did the negotiations and got to get these students released.\n\n\u201cThis is what our rural folks have been passing through for years now, negotiating to get their folks out, selling whatever they have, thanks to the inefficiency of our government. If anyone\u2019s loved one is taken, he will do whatever it takes to get the person out. That is what we have been going through for years, but it is making the news now because it is getting closer to the cities,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nHe also said the bandits want genuine peace because they are tired and that he has learned from several meetings with the bandits that they are willing to listen to religious leaders. He added that banditry is a social issue and should be treated as such. He also added that although there\u2019s a role for the military in the fight against banditry, it won\u2019t make the problem go away.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is what we find out, in all the five states we went in, they listen to clerics. In Niger State, they gathered in force to a meeting of war commanders, from six states, in the forest. There\u2019s a role for the military in all of these. Without the military, the North West would have been overrun by Boko Haram, the North Central will be overrun by these bandits, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) will overrun the South East, there will be warlords all-over South West.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for the military but if anybody tells you there\u2019s a military solution to this conflict, he\u2019s either dishonest or he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. There\u2019s no military solution to this problem. Banditry is a social problem and not a military one. We are increasingly militarising what is essentially a social problem. We are dropping a million-dollar bomb on people we should be providing water for.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Want appointments to reflect federal character\n\n\u2022Urge Buhari to address nation on insecurity\n\nBy Omon-Julius Onabu\n\nGovernors of the 17 southern states under the aegis of the Southern Governors Forum have called on the federal government to convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency to address widespread agitations among Nigerians for greater inclusiveness in governance.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should convoke a national dialogue as a matter of urgency,\u201d they said in a communique at the end of their meeting yesterday in Asaba, the Delta State capital.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country and end to open grazing in the Southern parts of the country to curb the excesses of armed herders.\n\nIn the 12-point communiqu\u00e9, the governors stressed the need to review appointments into federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character and the heterogeneity of the Nigerian population.\n\nThey said in the communiqu\u00e9, read by the Chairman of the forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, that they had resolved to foster cooperation among the Southern states and the nation at large.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added that the governors reviewed the situation in the country and deliberated on the current security situation, agitations/restructuring, prospect for inter-state collaboration and partnerships as well as on the incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTheir conclusion: \u201cWe affirm that the peoples of Southern Nigeria remain committed to the unity of Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness, equity and oneness, and peaceful co-existence between and among its peoples with a focus on the attainment of shared goals for economic development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nObserving that the incursion of armed herders, criminals, and bandits into the Southern part of the country has presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives, including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security, the governors said open grazing has to stop.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the meeting resolved that open grazing of cattle be banned across Southern Nigeria,\u201d they said, noting that development and population growth has put pressure on available land and increased the prospects of conflict between migrating herders and local populations in the South.\n\nGiven this scenario, they said, it has become imperative to enforce the ban on open grazing in the South, including cattle movement to the South by foot.\n\nThe governors also recommended that the federal government should support willing states to develop alternative and modern livestock management systems.\n\nThey added that the progress of the nation requires that urgent and bold steps be taken to restructure the Nigerian federation leading to the evolution of state police, review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments and creation of other institutions which legitimately advance the commitment to and practice of true federalism.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the sensitivities of our various peoples, there is a need to review appointments into the federal government agencies, including security agencies, to reflect federal character as Nigeria\u2019s overall population is heterogeneous.\u201d\n\nThey expressed concern over the continued gridlock on the Oshodi-Apapa Expressway and the chokehold, it exerted on the nation\u2019s economy being the sole outlet from Apapa Wharf.\n\nTo ease the gridlock, the governors recommended the activation and establishment of ports in other states of the federation to create new jobs and promote socio-economic activities in the country.\n\nThe governors also expressed concern over the economic implications of another lockdown on the country, and suggested greater coordination and cooperation between the federal and state governments in evolving strategies for dealing with the pandemic.\n\nThey further \u201cexpressed very grave concern on the security challenges currently plaguing the nation and strongly urged that Mr. President should address Nigerians on the challenges of insecurity and restore the confidence of our people.\n\nBesides Akeredolu, other governors at the meeting were Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State;; Chief Willie Obiano of Anambra State; Senator Duoye Diri of Bayelsa State; Chief Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; Mr. Godwin Obaseki of Edo State; Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; and Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nOthers are: Prince Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State; Mr. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State; and Chief Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\nHowever, Prof. Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State were absent, while Mr. Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) and Senator Hope Uzodimma (Imo State) were represented by their deputies.\n\nACF Backs Ban on Open Grazing, Supports Restructuring\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has endorsed the position of the southern governors\u2019 forum on the ban on open grazing of cattle.\n\nSpokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe stated this while reacting to the outcome of the governors\u2019 meeting in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\nHe however said before a decision should be taken on restructuring, Nigerians should first agree on whether the country should remain one before deciding on what structure to adopt.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the ban of open grazing, I don\u2019t think there is much problem here with the stand of the ACF.\n\n\u201cAt our last National Working Committee meeting in Kaduna, the National leader of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria spoke to us at length and he said he and his organisation have decided that the only way forward and that is in the interest of MACBAN, is to embark on ranching and that they were waiting for governments policy on this\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nHe stressed further that, \u201cIf MACABAN wants open grazing banned, not only in the southern part of Nigeria but all over Nigeria, who are we to say otherwise?\n\n\u201cWe are therefore in support of the stand of MACBAN and the Southern state governors.\u201d\n\nHe however said, on the issue of dialogue and restructuring, \u201cthe ACF has always believed in this if the aim of the dialogue is to promote the unity and progress of the whole country.\n\n\u201cOur forum will dialogue with any state and group of people that share our cherished ideals of unity, justice, peace and progress\u201d, Yawe said.\n\nOn restructuring, he said \u201cthe ACF believes that before we make a decision on this, we should agree on whether Nigeria should remain one country before deciding on what structure Nigeria should take.\n\n\u201cOur position on this is informed on the facts that some of the advocates of restructuring are at the same time advocating the dissolution of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAre they believers in Nigeria at all?

          "text": "\u2022Abacha\u2019s $311m refund intact, says Orji\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), manager of Nigeria\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), yesterday announced its audited results for its 2020 financial year, reflecting a strong financial performance and consistent implementation of strategic infrastructure investment programmes for the year.\n\nThe results showed that despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year under review, the NSIA recorded 343 per cent growth in its total income, which rose to N160.06 billion in 2020, up from the N36.15 billion in the previous year.\n\nAlso, excluding devaluation gain of N51 billion, the NSIA made a core income of N109 billion compared to N33.07 billion in 2019.\n\nIn addition, it achieved 33 per cent growth in net assets to N772.75 billion, compared with the N579.54 billion it achieved in 2019.\n\nNSIA Managing Director, Mr. Uche Orji, said at a virtual media briefing yesterday that the organisation received an additional contribution of $250 million and provided the first stabilisation support to the federal government of $150 million withdrawn from the Stabilisation Fund, in the year under review.\n\nSimilarly, the NSIA received $311 million from funds recovered from late Gen. Sani Abacha from the United States Department of Justice and Island of Jersey for funding of Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) projects such as Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 adversely affected logistics around infrastructure projects, especially the toll road projects, and the presidential fertiliser initiative. In response to COVID-19, NSIA partnered Global Citizen, a not-for-profit group, to form the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund. Separately NSIA acquired and distributed oxygen concentrators to 21 teaching hospitals as part of corporate social responsibility, in addition to staffing support to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19,\u201d Orji said.\n\nGiving a highlight on the activities of Nigeria Infrastructure Fund (NIF), he said projects under construction in the country had reached major milestones across domestic infrastructure projects in motorways, agriculture, and healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, in 2020, there were improved contributions from subsidiaries/affiliates such as Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company (InfraCredit), Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) and Family Homes Funds Ltd (FHFL).\n\nThe NSIA, he said, invested additional capital into NG Clearing, the first derivative clearing house in Nigeria to maintain NSIA\u2019s shareholding at 16.5 per cent following the company\u2019s rights issue of 2020.\n\nOrji said the NSIA in 2020 launched its Nigeria Innovation Fund to address investment opportunities within Nigeria in information technology with an immediate pipeline that included data networking, data centres, software, and services as well as agri-tech and biotech.\n\nIt also made progress on developing the ammonia and diammonium phosphate production plants in partnership with OCP in the review year, as it selected Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom as the venue after an extensive review of several other locations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the year under review, COVID-19 adversely impacted NSIA key infrastructure projects, with significant disruptions to the supply chains and logistics of NSIA\u2019s key projects. NSIA maintained its three-pronged investment approach: direct investments, co-investment with partners, and creation of financial institutions to fill critical institutional voids in the infrastructure landscape. In 2020 the Authority recorded significant progress on all fronts.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the Authority has invested significantly in crucial sub-sectors of the financial landscape with the intention of bridging critical voids that otherwise constrain investments and smooth operations in the sector.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the access roads to the Second Niger Bridge, 2A and 2B, 17.5 kilometres (Km) each (totaling 35km), were added to PIDF scope of work. \u201cThese had initially been part of scope expected to be carried out by the Federal Ministry of Works but owing to several challenges they have been unable to commence the projects leading to a transfer to the NSIA. The original scope of NSIA\u2019s section was 10.7KM of bridge and road, bringing the entire project to more than 45Km.\n\n\u201cAs of year-end 2020, the original scope of 10.7km Second Niger Bridge is at 53 per cent completion with a completion target of 2022. The Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is at 66 per cent completion and is expected to be completed in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe initial scope of the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway is at 66 per cent completion. However, please note that the scope of the project has been expanded from the rehabilitation of 92.5km along the three sections of the road to the full reconstruction of the entire stretch of 375km, as directed by Mr. President; this has extended the completion date. The NSIA is exploring options to shorten the completion timeline for the project.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA ran the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) from December 2016 to December 2020, adding that the operator company \u2013 NAIC-NPK \u2013 has now been spun off to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI).\n\n\u201cThe Authority\u2019s role in the programme has shifted upstream. NSIA\u2019s role is limited to importation, storage, and the wholesale of raw materials to blenders. In essence, blenders are expected to build the capacity to actively participate in the sub-sector.\n\n\u201cOver the period it ran, 42 blending plants were enlisted under the programme while a total of 30 million 50kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 fertiliser were made available to the Nigerian farmers. Beyond serving a proof of concept for import substitution in the fertiliser space, the programme led to the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the agriculture value chain including in logistics, ports, bagging, rail, industrial warehousing, and haulage touchpoints amongst others. It also enabled the country to conserve foreign exchange that would have otherwise been used for subsidy payment,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on his outlook for 2021, he said the NSIA would raise fund by issuing a Sukuk bond.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAlthough NSIA believes the market is unlikely to repeat some of the performance of 2020, it is more likely that a broader market recovery will occur with economies opening unlike the case in 2020 in which technology stocks drove market performance.\n\n\u201cIn the Future Generations Fund, we expect to allocate more capital to venture capital, global equity markets, and increasing exposure to European equities where we had been underexposed in 2020. NSIA believes that the broad opening of the markets will provide a comprehensive lift to equities.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigeria Infrastructure Fund, the Innovation Fund is expected to be very active as we see opportunities in data centers, data networking, software, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and many others.\n\n\u201cNSIA expects to complete concession, capital raise and operationalisation of the three PIDF road projects: Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Highway.\n\n\u201cDespite concerns around new waves of COVID-19, the Authority remains confident that with widespread vaccination programmes, global economies will continue to reopen and create more opportunities to create value by the NSIA.\u201d\n\nOrji also shed more light on the NSIA\u2019s financial performance when he appeared yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe explained that some of the NSIA\u2019s portfolios were up by as much as 50 per cent in dollar terms in 2020, predicting that although the financial technology sector ruled the market last year, there will be a broader profit ecosystem this year as countries continue to open up on the back of increasing COVID-19 vaccine jabs.\n\nAccording to him, the body has been aggressive in terms of its focus on international equities, private equity investments, venture capital and direct investments in the international market, where much of the profits came from.\n\nHe said with the exception of just one or two portfolios, every single asset class made substantial returns to the NSIA last year, with net profit of N108.9 billion.\n\nHe predicted a broader recovery for the equity side of the investments this year, saying that although stock market growth in 2020 was largely anchored on technology, activities in 2021 will be driven by aviation and the industrial sectors as the world opens up again.\n\nUche stated that fixed income should be closely watched by investors, except for the impact of inflation, which he predicted would make interest rates go up and make fixed income instruments fall.\n\n\u201cMy view is that on the balance of risk, we are more likely to see interest rates go up than go down,\u201d he added, noting that venture capitalist funds are also being explored by the organisation.\n\n\u201cOn the average, we had almost 30 per cent returns in dollar terms and we are going to be more aggressive in venture capital,\u201d he said.\n\nUche stated that the NSIA is also investing in fintech, software services, data networking as well as biotech and pharmaceuticals.\n\nBesides, the NSIA has also intervened in the diagnostics and radiology centres in Kano and Umuahia and the cancer centres at the Lagos Nigeria University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).\n\nIt is also discussing with the University College, London, to develop pharmaceutical industries in Nigeria.\n\nOn the Abacha loot, he stated: \u201cThe Abacha fund was $311 million that was returned to Nigeria by the US Department of Justice and Island of Jersey and the agreement was to spread the money in equal measures across three projects.\n\n\u201cThese are the Lagos-Ibadan Road, Abuja-Kano Road and the Second Niger Bridge. Each of them will get $103million-$104 million. To spend the money, we have been required to have external auditors aside from our in-house auditors as Deloitte to monitor the disbursement of that fund.\n\n\u201cA civil society group, CLEEN foundation has been appointed by the Ministry of Justice and also with the US government to also supervise the disbursement of the fund. So, you can imagine that every single pair of eyes possible are overlooking how these funds will be disbursed.\n\n\u201cThe fund is still there intact. Not a dime has been spent. It is being held in our accounts with the central bank.\u201d\n\nHe added that another \u20ac4.2 was being expected to be repatriated, which the authorities have agreed should come to the NSIA to be used for the three projects.\n\nAccording to him, the NSIA is planning to invest more in healthcare sector this year, with the ramping up of infrastructure in Abuja and an eye on 20 such centres nationwide.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nAn indigenous firm, UTM Offshore Limited, has signed a deal with Japan Gas Corporation (JGC), a leading international Engineering Design, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm, to establish a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility, the first of its kind in Nigeria.\n\nThis followed the issuance of licence by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to establish the FLNG facility.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited took a major step to actualise the project yesterday, signing virtually, a landmark preliminary front end engineering design (Pre-FEED) agreement with JGC.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the Pre-FEED scope would be completed within four months from commencement date.\n\nUTM has also engaged Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR) of the UK to provide owner\u2019s engineering services on the project.\n\nKBR is to provide due diligence on the JGC scope by conducting a third-party review of all deliverables from JGC during the Pre-FEED.\n\nSpeaking at the virtual signing event, the Managing Director of UTM Offshore Limited, Mr. Julius Rone, said JGC Corporation came highly recommended given the several similar projects the firm had undertaken across the world.\n\n\u201cWhat UTM is doing is largely novel. It is the first of its kind in Nigeria and we are very excited about this trail-blazing project: The opportunity to build from the scratch, the first floating liquefied natural gas facility in Nigeria is humongous. That is why we cannot afford to settle for less hence our resolve to contract JGC Corporation, one of the leading firms in the LNG Construction sector in the world, to provide the Pre-Front End Engineering Design Services for this first Floating LNG facility in Nigeria,\u201d Rone said.\n\nUTM Offshore Limited is pioneering the development of the FLNG facility in collaboration with LNG Investment Management Services (LIMS), a subsidiary of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe facility, a newly-built vessel, will receive gas feedstock from an existing offshore facility, treat it to required LNG standard, liquefy the gas, store the LNG and offload to LNG carriers.\n\nAccording to Rone, the floating LNG, when fully completed shall have an LNG production capacity of 1.2 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa), Turret and Mooring System, Gas pre-treatment modules, LNG production modules, living quarters, self-contained power generation and utilities as well as capacities for LNG storage and offloading.\n\nAt the landmark agreement signing event, Rone thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for creating an enabling environment for indigenous firms like UTM Offshore to equitably operate in the very sensitive and competitive upstream sector of the petroleum industry.\n\nHe said that the resolve of UTM Offshore to embark on the huge project is steeped in the National Gas Policy of the Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nRone said: \u201cAt UTM Offshore, we completely agree with Mr. President that given Nigeria\u2019s potential of about 600 trillion cubic feet of gas, the commodity has the enormous potential to diversify our country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe also agree that the rising global demand for cleaner energy sources has offered Nigeria an opportunity to exploit gas resources for the good of the country.\n\n\u201cWe thank the president for making gas development and utilization a national priority to stimulate economic growth, further improve Nigeria\u2019s energy mix, drive investments, and provide the much-needed jobs for our citizens in the country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, for tenaciously driving Mr. President\u2019s vision in the petroleum sector, particularly the gas policy.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to key players in the national petroleum industry, notably the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, and the Director of Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Mr. Sarki Auwalu, for their support for the FLNG project.\n\nAccording to him, other partners and critical stakeholders that are supporting the FLNG project include Afreximbank, NAPIMS, Templars, Vitol, Yahaska Energy Services Limited and the government of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI am particularly thankful to the visionary Governor of Delta State, His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who from Day One, believed in our dream of building the first Floating LNG in Nigeria and has been of immense support since then.\n\n\u201cWe cannot thank him enough. Indeed, we are assuring all our partners and stakeholders that we will not let them down,\u201d Rone said.\n\nAuwalu, who attended the event virtually lauded Rone and his team for blazing the trail in building Nigeria first Floating LNG. He said: \u201cIt is a historic event today as UTM Offshore working with our support is actualizing Mr. President vision not just for gas and the diversification of our economy.\n\n\u201cMr. President has promised to migrate Nigeria to gas and that is what UTM Offshore is doing with the decision to build and operate and FLNG. It is a tortuous process but I can confirm that UTM Offshore has met all the requirements and that is why DPR gave the firm license to proceed with the building of the FLNG.\n\n\u201cAt DPR we have been monitoring closely what UTM is doing and we are very happy that they are working with the best firms and consultants in the world, in fact, first-class and globally renowned firms are working with UTM Offshore to actualize this FLNG. DPR shall continue to guide and encourage UTM on this project.\u201d\n\nAn executive of JGC Corporation of Japan, Mr. Koji Sakrai, praised the vision and tenacity of Rone and his firm, pledging the commitment of his company to deploy the latest and cost-effective engineering design and constructions modules in undertaking the project and assured that the task would be completed within schedule.\n\nPresent at the agreement signing were the representatives of the GMD of NNPC, Mr. Abubakar Umar; representatives of Vitol, Mr. Chibuzor Ifeanyi; while Mr. Steve Brown also of Vitol joined virtually.\n\nAn Executive Director, Afrexim Bank, Mr. Ibrahim Sagna, joined virtually, while Mr. Peter Olowononi and Mrs Ngozi Kalu-Mba, also from the bank attended the event.\n\nSpecial Adviser on Investments to the Delta State Governor, Mr. Paul Nma, represented the governor, while Dr. Yahuza Kassim, who made a detailed presentation on the FLNG project represented Yahuza Energy Services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

That God should forgive our sins wherever we as a church or Nigerians, especially our leaders had sinned against God.\n\n\u201cThat the plans of the evil people in our midst to paralyze human, social and economic activities in this nation and throw the nation into chaos would be foiled by the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cThat any religious madness or war that would not allow us to worship God in the way we are convinced to worship Him would be nullified by the Lord.\n\n\u201cPray that the church would prevail overall threats to her existence in Nigeria. That the gate of hell will never prevail against the church in the name of Jesus.\n\n\u201cThat our leaders would do justice in leadership and show fairness to all ethnic and religious groups in all their actions to douse ethnic and religious tensions we have presently.\n\n\u201cThat the law enforcement agents would rise to their responsibilities and provide the necessary security we need in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat every step the terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, gunmen and other wicked people in our midst take henceforth would be failed. That unseen hands and the army of the Lord would fight them and Nigeria would be at peace.\n\n\u201cPray and plant righteousness, Godliness, prosperity, peace and love in our nation. Pray for the speedy recovery of our nation from all our losses so that this nation might become very soon a nation that everyone in the world would love to be.\n\n\u201cPray to break the yoke of the generational curse that might have been placed on Nigeria and her leadership during the slave trade by the victims.\"\n\nIn recent times, states across the country have been grappling with increased attacks by bandits, kidnappers and unknown gunmen.",

Not even a non-criminal suit that lack merits and grounds. I don\u2019t have time to waste walai.

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "On Monday, May 10, 2021, Practical Product \u2014 a community of product leaders and enthusiasts \u2014 released a State Of Product Management In Africa Report (PDF) based on a survey carried out between February 15 and March 1, 2021.\n\nResponses were gathered from 215 project managers working in Africa, with many surveyed responses from the fintech industry. Others included traditional finance institutions, edtech, healthtech, and agritech.\n\nThis report documented the state of project management in the continent. Among other things considered, gender discrepancy in the project management field stood out.\n\nOver the last decade, Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem has experienced commendable growth. From the rise of startups in varying fields of technology to inter-continental expansions, the future is very promising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomewhat ironically, this growth has been characterised by the slow-paced inclusiveness of women in tech. The survey revealed that men outnumber women in Africa\u2019s project management sector by almost 150%, reflecting patterns observed in the broader tech scope.\n\nAlthough we have women championing great feats in Africa\u2019s tech field, the man-woman dichotomy could use some balance.\n\nOf the 215 project managers surveyed, ~129 (59.8%) identified as men and ~85 (39.7%) as women. Less than 1% of respondents preferred not to disclose their gender.\n\nMoving on to ranks, women hold 45% of PM positions and 26% of senior PM positions. Only 25% of women hold VP/head of products positions. On average, men hold 74% of the senior roles.\n\nThe report also stated that ~93 (43%) \u2014 ~27 women (29%) and ~65 (70%) men \u2014 of the 215 respondents earn $1,000/month.\n\nFor job satisfaction of the surveyed respondents, 74% of men (~96) and 54% of women (~37) felt happy with their jobs.\n\nFourteen per cent of female Assistant Product Managers (APMs) expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs, with reasons ranging from feeling less supported on the job to a lack of clarity in career path to not being well paid.\n\nThe gulf between men and women in the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem is still worth discussing. Many times we have explored this issue, told the stories of notable personalities and looked at practical ways to bridge the gap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven as the tech industry burgeons in Africa, we hope that this imbalance and existing stereotypes are eroded. At the day\u2019s end, differing biological characteristics are not determinants for mental and skill-learning capabilities.\n\nThe Practical Product report surveyed skills, compensation, and general well being in Africa\u2019s project management sector, with issues like lack of autonomy and hostile work environment cited as major challenges faced by many project managers.\n\nSome countries that participated in the survey include Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nFeatured image credits: Christina Morillo from Pexels\n\niXperience raises $2.5m Series A | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

Justice Esther Edigin for her contribution to the peace and development of the state, pledging that his government will sustain ongoing reforms in the judiciary.\n\nObaseki made the pledge when he received Justice Edigin who was on a valedictory visit to the governor at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nEdigin, who will be retiring on Monday, May 17, 2021, was sworn-in as the seventh substantive Chief Judge of Edo State on Friday, November 22, 2019, following the retirement of Hon. Justice Esohe Ikponmwen from the state\u2019s public service.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cWe have been very consistent, as a government, about the judiciary. The Judiciary is the anchor on which our democracy rests and as such must be treated and given its due place in our democracy.\n\n\u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to cover more grounds as desired in terms of judiciary transformation in Edo State. The Executive is currently going through that process as we have reforms to show; the legislature is also pushing for a very hard transformation and it will be our joy carrying the judiciary joins in this trend to ensure the transformation and modernization of the judiciary system.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki said his administration will continue to cooperate and work with the judiciary to make it more effective and efficient in discharging its responsibilities.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe are dealing with a new world and nobody expected it as we were caught napping. Various institutions and states rely solely on one major source of resources. This is not good for us; it should be about our collective survival and not individual survival; we either sail or sink together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make Edo State the judiciary hub of this zone. As a government, we want to thank you for your services to Edo State. We will continue to reform the Judiciary system,\u201d he reassured.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Judge commended Governor Obaseki for the cordial relationship and cooperation with the Judiciary.\n\nShe said: \u201cl am here today to pay you a valedictory visit as part of events marking my disengagement from the Judiciary and Government of Edo State.\n\n\u201cI will be retiring next week, Monday, May 17, 2021. I want to thank the Edo State Government for the cooperation with the Judiciary. The government facilitated the construction and handover of 12 modern Courts to the Judiciary. You have also awarded contracts for the building of three Magistrate Courts in Ikpoba-Okha, Oredo and Egor Local Government Areas.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "By Mutiat Alli\n\nWith the rate of civil unrest, attacks, and killings in Nigeria, Adodo Eddy Osaman, a renowned Training Specialist in Canada and Voice on global issues, has urged the Nigerian youths with traveling ambitions not to be distracted from their goals, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that although the pandemic is still on, there are lots of travel opportunities still out there for the taking. Let\u2019s not be deceived.\n\nThere are lot of ways to travel out of Nigeria for good.\u201d\n\nEddyOsaman, as he fondly known on social media also encouraged Nigerians to embrace scholarship and study opportunities in Canada and Europe.\n\nReiterating why he always recommend Nigerians to immigrate either to Canada or Europe, the Travel enthusiast says, \u201d when I say Europe, I mean either the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland.\n\nIceland) or the Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia). The Nordic countries have been rated even better than Canada and the USA in respect to living standards, GDP and even in passport power.\n\nFor folks who find Canada or the Nordic countries expensive, they can opt for the Baltic countries, which are also good Schengen countries to begin with.\u201d\n\nUsing Canada his base as a case study, Eddyosaman shed more light on the true meaning of Scholarships, \u201cwhen people think scholarships, they usually imagine an all-expense-paid trip.\n\nThis is not usually the case in all situations. In Canada and other major travel destinations, there are 2 major types of scholarships \u2013 Full scholarships and Partial scholarships.\n\nREAD ALSO: Boko Haram offers Adamawa community N2million discount from N30million ransom to free captives\n\nFull scholarships (100% funded) are more affiliated with Higher academic levels such as MSc & PhD, but Partial scholarships can apply to all levels, including BSc. This does not mean BSc aspirants cannot find full scholarships. There are, but you will have to dig deeper.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, EddyOsaman also gave out tips and guidelines on how to get full scholarships to Canada, \u201cdon\u2019t go looking at popular scholarship websites,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding, \u201cKnowing fully well that Canada is the most desirable country in the world, there\u2019s a possibility that millions of students worldwide have already applied to those opportunities and your chances of acceptance will be very thin.\n\nIf you are looking for full scholarships, then you should actually be looking for research opportunities. Research opportunities are usually funded by the Government or Private companies, and they come with lots of perks. Researches are not limited to the Science/Medical field.\n\nIt can be for any profession. Some research can be awkward and funny. I have seen fully funded scholarships tied to research on Owls and even Beetles.\u201d\n\nAside being a travel enthusiast, EddyOsamen is also a Training Specialist in Teleperformance \u2013 the world\u2019s largest Customer Service Company, as well as the founder of iGroup Nigeria, a brand which comprises of",
