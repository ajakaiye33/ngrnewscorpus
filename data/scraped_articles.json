          "title": "Govt approach wrong, ransom payment won\u2019t end kidnapping \u2013 Obasanjo",
          "text": "FORMER President, Olusegun Obasanjo, on Wednesday declared that governments of former President, Goodluck Jonathan, and Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) paid ransom to kidnappers but they denied it.\n\nObasanjo said he did not believe in payment of ransom to kidnappers and banditry, maintaining that it encouraged criminals indulging in the act.\n\nHe spoke on Wednesday at his Penthouse residence within Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library in Abeokuta, Ogun State, while playing host to members of Tiv Professionals\u2019 Group led by Prof. Zacharys Anger Gundu.\n\nHe, however, submitted that the government must develop the means to deal with kidnappers and bandits heavily in place of ransom payment.\n\nObasanjo insisted that it required a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach to fight insecurity challenges to a standstill.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly. This is because when you pay ransom, you encourage.\n\n\u201cBut if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it. Government has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during (Goodluck) Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they denied it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the forthcoming 2023 elections, Obasanjo said leaders must ensure the election birthed the emergence of a new federation in Nigeria; otherwise the country might be \u201csliding into grand dissolution.\u201d\n\nHe bemoaned insecurity challenges and insisted that 2023 must mark a watershed for Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cI do believe that whatever else we do we have to make the year 2023 a watershed for Nigeria. The year 2023 should give us the beginning of emergence of a new federation or feeling that the rot continues, and then, we are going to be sliding back to a grand dissolution. God forbid.\u201d\n\nWhile relaying the position of a military friend, Obasanjo expressed fears that those beating drums of division in Nigeria didn\u2019t think about the interest of the minority ethnic groups.\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd he would say to me if the Yoruba can stand as a country, if the Igbo can stand as a country, if the Hausa/Fulani can stand as a country, if you, major tribes, decide to break up from the country, where do you want the minority ethnic groups to stand? That, many Nigerians don\u2019t know about, unfortunately.\n\n\u201cWhere do we want those minor groups to stand? Wherever they stand, now they are by virtue of Nigeria\u2019s present situation a little bit protected. But if Nigeria breaks up and they are in a smaller country, they will be oppressed. They will always be exterminated. Are we thinking of that?\u201d\n\nPresenting a paper earlier, the leader of the group, Prof. Zacharys Anger Gundu, told Obasanjo that \u201cblood is flowing in Benue State\u201d following killings of the people allegedly by Fulani and bandits.\n\nHe, however, demanded that full compensation for the victims of killings and destruction in Tivland, proscription of armed fulani groups, while \u201cland grabbing must stop and all occupied lands must be vacated.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

They were later taken to an undisclosed hospital for medical evaluation.\n\nBuhari welcomes release of Afaka students\n\nAlso, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday welcomed the release of the students.\n\nHe also congratulated their friends, families and the government and people of Kaduna State on the development.\n\nA statement by Buhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, quoted the President as saying. \u201cWe are happy they have been released.\n\n\u201cWe express our deep appreciation to all the actors who contributed one way or the other to this happy outcome, in particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State.

          "title": "Cash crunch: Labour draws battle lines, warns against salary slash",
          "text": "Organised labour on Wednesday cautioned the Federal Government against reduction of workers\u2019 salaries in its attempt to cut down personnel cost in view of the cash crunch facing the country.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress and the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria warned that any attempt to reduce workers\u2019 pay would be suicidal.\n\nREAD ALSO: Bandits kill two Kaduna volunteers, abduct scores, raze church\n\nAccording to them, if government is desirous of reducing its bloated payroll, it should slash the fat remuneration and allowances of political office holders \u201cwho do very little but collect so much.\u2019\u2019\n\nRecall that the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, at the policy dialogue on corruption and cost of governance organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission in Abuja on Tuesday, said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) had directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to review the government payroll.\n\nAlso at the event, the Director-General of the Budget Office, Ben Akabueze disclosed that the cost of governance under the Buhari regime had risen sharply from N3.61tn in 2015 to N5.26tn in 2018 and N7.91tn in 2020.\n\nThere were reports on Wednesday (not by The PUNCH) that the review planned by government would lead to slashing of workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nBut the minister\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Communications, Yunusa Abdullahi, in an interview with The PUNCH explained that the review would not lead to salary reduction.\n\nHe said government was working at ensuring pay parity among staff under its employ in various agencies.\n\nAbdullahi, said, \u201cGovernment is not thinking of cutting wages, rather salary harmonisation. There are some government agencies who pay much higher than other agencies for staff at the same grade level. So if you like, it\u2019s more of a pay parity.\n\n\u201cWhat government hopes to achieve is to redistribute wages equally across board. So, the (finance) minister\u2019s thesis and mandate of the President is: \u2018let\u2019s bring our salary structure within government agencies as close or as equal as possible.\u201d\n\nAlso in a statement on Wednesday titled \u2018Workers to earn more as FG seeks pay parity, says finance minister,\u2019 Abdullahi said the aim of the payroll review directive given by the Federal Government which the minister mentioned was to achieve salary harmonisation, not reduction.\n\nDespite the minister\u2019s aide explanations, the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, in a statement on Wednesday titled, \u2018We have no more blood to bleed: Organised labour in Nigeria condemns and rejects plans to slash the salaries of Nigerian workers,\u2019 berated Ahmed.\n\nHe urged government to respond to the demands by Labour for an upward review of salaries of all workers.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is most unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time. The question to ask is \u2018which salary is government planning to slash?\u2019 It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30,000 which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice. The proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay.\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the multiple devaluation of the Naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria have knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across board. Nigerian workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth. Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThis call for salary slash by Mrs Zainab Ahmed is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers. It is most uncharitable, most insensitive, most dehumanizing and most barbaric. Nigerian workers demand an immediate retraction and apology by the minister of finance.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, the ASCSN president, Dr Tommy Etim admonished the government to cut salaries of political office holders, adding that National Assembly members should sit on a part-time basis.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe government should reduce the pay of political office holders, the pay cut should begin with the political office holders. Not only that, let them also come up with a law that will make National Assembly to be on a part-time basis. Their sitting should be on a part-time basis because the chunk of money goes to them.\n\n\u201cSo, it would be better if the government looks towards that direction and leaves the civil service alone. A civil servant is responsible for more than five family members by African tradition extended family system. So, how do you expect them to survive on N30,000 minimum wage? Some states are not even paying. I mean, it is absurd for any government to contemplate pay cut for workers at this point.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso some civil rights groups condemned the Federal Government. The Convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, said the political office holders should cut the cost of governance.\n\nHe noted, \u201cAll the ministries in Nigeria buy cars worth billions every year. Only the ministry of health, police, and the military need official vehicles. Imagine if we sell all the vehicles in all the ministries and parastatals, we would have saved billions of naira which can also be used in developing the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Director, Coalition in Defence of Democracy and Constitution, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, said the NLC president lacked the capacity to engage the FG on workers welfare and should be removed by the union members.\u201d\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe decision of the FG to reduce workers salaries is an attempt to send workers into penury and weaponise poverty. That\u2019s what this regime has been doing since 2015.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "SECURITY experts on Wednesday said the Nigerian Army had failed to efficiently tackle security challenges in the country despite the huge fund it received in the last two years.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Minister, Zainab Ahmed, had told the Senate Committee on Army on Tuesday that a total of N1,008.84tn was released to the Army between January 2019 and April 2021.\n\nAhmed, who was summoned based on complaints by the Nigerian Army that it had outstanding N50bn to collect from the ministry which was part of the budgetary provision to fight terrorism, had said the Army got more than budgetary provision during the period under review.\n\nHowever, a security risk management and intelligence specialist, Kabir Adamu, in an interview with The PUNCH, said the Nigerian Army had so far failed in its mandate despite the money released to it.\n\nAdamu added that the country witnessed more cases of banditry, terrorism and kidnapping during the period.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat was the mandate given to them? Is it not to contain insurgency? Unfortunately, they have not justified it. If their mandate was also to curb banditry, they have not been able to do that.\n\n\u201cBut in the Nigeria security architecture, there are no clear key performance indicators to allow non-insider to monitor and evaluate them. The only measure we have is how insecurity affects us; we have witnessed more kidnappings, banditry, and terrorism. The conclusion is that they have not justified the money given to them.\u201d\n\nAnother security expert, Nnamdi Anekwe, in a separate interview with our correspondent, said the Nigerian Army had not been able to defend the nation\u2019s territory and also failed to protect the population.\n\nHe stated that there had been controversy on the utilisation of the fund.\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me remind you that there has been back and forth between the Ministry of Defence and previous service chiefs on the utilisation of this money.\n\n\u201cIt was reported that some of the monies have been used to procure arms but the current service chiefs have said they lacked weapons. They have not been able to defend our territory and have also not protected the population.\u201d\n\nBut Col. Hassan Stan-Labo (retd.), a security specialist, said the N1tn was not enough, describing it as a drop in the ocean.\n\nStan-Labo described the defence sector as a capital-intensive venture, stressing that the neglect of the sector in the past years had created a vacuum which made the funding by the Ministry of Finance insufficient.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe defence sector has been neglected for too long by being starved of adequate fund and well-equipped inventory. This got this long because as a nation, we are not security-conscious. Even under this dispensation, you can see that there is no seriousness.\u201d\n\nThe Army did not respond to request for details of the spending on hardware on Wednesday.\n\nThe Army\u2019s spokesman, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Yerima, has yet to respond to a message sent to him on the matter as of the time of filing this report.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Says Finance Minister\u2019s careless statement can set nation on fire\n\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young\n\nOrganised Labour yesterday condemned and rejected plans by the federal government to slash workers\u2019 salaries, warning that such careless statement could set the nation\u2019s on fire.\n\nLabour in a statement by the President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Finance to order before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements.\n\nReacting to the statement credited to the Finance Minister that the Federal Government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers, NLC expressed shock with such utterance.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIt is most unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cIt was with huge shock that we read the statement credited to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who said that the Federal Government was working to reduce the high cost of governance by cutting down on the salaries of Nigerian workers.\n\n\u2018\u2019 Minister was reported to have said this in Abuja at a policy dialogue on corruption and cost of governance in Nigeria organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Minister was also reported to have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to immediately review the salaries of civil servants and the number of federal agencies in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is most unthinkable that government would be contemplating to unilaterally slash the salaries of Nigerian workers at this time. The question to ask is \u2018which salary is government planning to slash?\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019It certainly cannot be the meagre national minimum wage of N30,000 which right now cannot even buy a bag of rice. The proposed slash in salaries is certainly not targeted at the minimum wage and consequential adjustment in salaries that some callous state governors are still dragging their feet to pay!\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the multiple devaluation of the Naira in a very short time and the prevailing high inflation rate in Nigeria has knocked out the salaries earned by Nigerian workers across board.\n\n\u2018\u2019Nigerian workers are only surviving by hair\u2019s breadth. Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time.\n\n\u201cThis call for salary slash by Mrs. Zainab Ahmed is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers. It is most uncharitable, most insensitive, most dehumanizing and most barbaric. Nigerian workers demand an immediate retraction and apology by the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cWe call on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the Minister of Finance to order now before she sets Nigeria on fire with her careless statements. If there is any salary that needs serious slashing, it is the humungous remuneration and allowances pocketed by political office holders in Nigeria who do very little but collect so much!\n\n\u201cWorkers generate surplus value and revenue for government. We do not constitute any unnecessary cost or burden to governance! It is also important to make the point that salaries are products of contracts governed by laws. They cannot be unilaterally adjusted.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\npalliatives to help their people through the terrible socio-economic dislocations occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be completely absurd for the Nigerian government to be thinking of salary slash.\n\n\u2018\u2019This move is not only at great odds with global best responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also in violation of relevant ILO Conventions and Declarations on Wages and Decent Work.\n\n\u201cWe urge Government as a social partner to quickly respond to the demands by Labour for an upward review of salaries of all Nigerian workers. Nigerian workers have showed sufficient understanding with government through the tough patches of the pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2019Now, Nigerian workers demand reciprocity of our understanding. Nigerian workers demand an increase in their remunerations and allowances. Enough is enough!\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The Presidency has come under fire over its Tuesday allegation that it has evidence that some \u2018disruptive elements\u2019 are planning to recruit ethnic groups and politicians to pass a vote of no confidence on the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe allegation by the Presidency, though came short of directly accusing the \u2018disruptive elements\u2019, which it described as religious leaders and former political leaders, of planning to overthrow the Buhari administration, its use of words, including earlier statements by the Military and the Department of State Services (DSS), were read by Nigerians, including prominent members of the Nigerian society and groups, to mean that the Presidency was alluding to an overthrow of the government.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Robert Clark obviously stirred the hornets nest when, during a television interview, suggested that the military should take over government temporarily in order to restructure the country.\n\nClark\u2019s, suggestion, though unpopular with Nigerians, came on the heels of growing discontent in the country over worsening insecurity that has led to unprecedented fear in the country, and calls for President Buhari to rein in the criminal elements terrorising Nigerians.\n\nMr. Femi Adesina, the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, in a statement on Tuesday, said the motive behind the plan by the \u2018disruptive elements\u2019 was to throw the country into further turmoil.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Department of State Services on Sunday alerted on sinister moves by misguided elements to wreak havoc on the government, sovereignty and corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cChampioned by some disgruntled religious and past political leaders, the intention is to eventually throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel a forceful and undemocratic change of leadership.\n\n\u201cFurther unimpeachable evidence shows that these disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed in the President, thus throwing the land into further turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country.\n\n\u201cThe agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nPeeved by the allegation by the presidency, several Nigerians and groups, including the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Afenifere, the Yoruba sociocultural group, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), among others, have come hard on the presidency, accusing it of heating up the polity and reading meanings to every sincere comment and advice by Nigerians.\n\nFor the ACF, it was uncharitable for the Presidency to see and call every dissenting voice or perceived critics of the All Progressives Congress (APC) government as disgruntled elements.\n\nThe group, which spoke through its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, said the Presidency has a penchant for viewing every critic with dark motives, which it said was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency must be broad-minded enough to accommodate all shades of opinions. The criticism is done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country. It is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country\u201d, the ACF spokesman said.\n\nPANDEF on it\u2019s part, accused the Presidency of chasing shadows instead of looking for how to surmount the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nAccording to PANDEF\u2019s spokesman, Ken Robinson, tagging religious leaders and past political leaders as disgruntled elements under the current security situation in the country was shocking and least expected.\n\n\u201cPANDEF cautions that the Presidency should stop chasing shadows. Citizens are anxious and troubled, many are becoming hopeless, with even the security agencies seemingly helpless and vulnerable\u201d, Robinson said.\n\nFor the PDP, the statement from the Presidency only shows that President Buhari and the ruling APC were being haunted by their shadows, insisting that they are afraid of experiencing what they did to others in the past.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP added that the allegation by the Presidency was only a desperate attempt by the Buhari administration to blackmail Nigerians to cover up for its failures.\n\n\u201cRather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing our nation, the Presidency is busy engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, imperative to state that the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically elected governments.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the Presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood\u201d, the party said.\n\nFor elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, the Buhari administration was only embarking on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue, adding that he does not support any change of government other than through the ballot box.\n\nYakasai said: \u201cIt is not enough to embark on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue. We have yet to recover from the violent overthrow of the Tafawa Balewa-led first Republic by young military officers. I do not support any change of government other than that which comes through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe apex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, also distanced itself from the allegation by the Presidency, saying it is not interested in anything coup.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, however, said that even the President himself knows that all was not well with the country.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze is not interested in anything coup. Ohanaeze is interested that the President should listen to us and address the nation. The President should reorder his steps. He should root his governance in justice because everything has become injustice especially to the Igbo,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum (MBF), on it\u2019s part, viewed the allegation by the Presidency as an insult to the sensibilities of Nigerians, reminding the President that Nigeria was operating a democratic system of government.\n\nThe group\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Dr Isuwa Dogo said: \u201cWe view the statement as an expression of guilt by the Presidency for the deteriorating situation of things in the country including insecurity and its inability to stop it.\u201d\n\nFor the Afenifere, the allegation was a non issue, as its leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo insisted that Afenifere and other sociocultural groups in the South are only interested in the peaceful restructuring of the country.\n\n\u201cWho is interested in passing a vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him\u201d, Adebanjo asked.\n\nExpectedly, Nigerians took to the social media, especially the micro blogging site, Twitter to express their anger and views on the allegation from the Presidency, with most declaring that it was a mere propaganda to divert attention from the real issues begging for attention.\n\nFor many, the allegation was also in line with the known blame game of the Buhari administration.\n\nFor Twitter user @IdorenyinEtuk5, an amendment of the Nigerian constitution to allow for citizens to call for early elections if not happy with government\u2019s performance would have exposed the Buhari administration.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cLet presidency call for amendment to the constitution to allow for citizens to call for early elections if they are dissatisfied with their govt and let\u2019s see how Buhari will fair since they are worried about calls for Buhari\u2019s removal as if it were illegal. DSS are so worthless to have said that it was a threat to national security. Same DSS that has nothing to offer where real threats to citizens are concerned. DSS must be scrapped, all its point men and women sacked.\u201d\n\nFor @Abdultiggi, if removing the President will bring solution to the problems in the country, so be it. He wrote: \u201cIf by removing him will bring solution to the country then why not? Insecurity is killing our nation\u201d, while @cthereality, concurred with him, declaring the statement from the Presidency was a cheap propaganda.\n\n\u201cMy brother, this is the cheapest propaganda I\u2019ve ever heard. Instead of facing the reality on ground, they\u2019re busy raising false alarm. All we need is security. If they can\u2019t secure us, what options do we have?\u201d, he said.\n\nFor @sticksnsnares, removing the President to have a secure Nigeria is a welcome idea. He wrote: \u201cWhatever they can do to remove him is on course. killings and kidnappings everyday and the President has refused to do anything but raising force alarm. A President that cannot come out openly to address his people, all we see are pictures. Prices of goods increase everyday\u201d, while @udehNudeh prayed for the success of the plot, if there is any, insisting that Buhari did same thing before.. He wrote: \u201cMay the plot succeed. Why is @MBuhari afriad of being overthrown? But he had overthrown someone and made someone\u2019s Government ungovernable\u2026. He who lives in a glass shouldn\u2019t throw stones\u2026.\u201d\n\nFor @DopplerFilmz, removing President Buhari would not be any big deal because he was once removed. \u201cHe was removed the first time, removing him again, at this time, will be a blessing to this nation\u201d, he wrote while @creality wants government to concentrate on the real issues. \u201cPlease stop diverting our attention and fix what\u2019s facing us. What a cheap propaganda\u201d, he said.\n\n@ucheclive believes the allegation by the presidency was part of the blame game of the Buhari administration, while @tobiduddleycoker wondered why the President and his handlers are afraid. \u201c@MBuhari @GarShehu @FemAdesina you all are afraid; nobody is removing Buhari forcefully. Your ghost is chasing you. It is better @MBuhari resigns honorably for being a failure\u201d, he wrote, while @abelcifezie declared that the government was merely chasing shadows.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cBeing chased by their shadows.

The criticism is done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country. It is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country\u201d, the ACF spokesman said.\n\nPANDEF on it\u2019s part, accused the Presidency of chasing shadows instead of looking for how to surmount the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nAccording to PANDEF\u2019s spokesman, Ken Robinson, tagging religious leaders and past political leaders as disgruntled elements under the current security situation in the country was shocking and least expected.\n\n\u201cPANDEF cautions that the Presidency should stop chasing shadows. Citizens are anxious and troubled, many are becoming hopeless, with even the security agencies seemingly helpless and vulnerable\u201d, Robinson said.\n\nFor the PDP, the statement from the Presidency only shows that President Buhari and the ruling APC were being haunted by their shadows, insisting that they are afraid of experiencing what they did to others in the past.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP added that the allegation by the Presidency was only a desperate attempt by the Buhari administration to blackmail Nigerians to cover up for its failures.\n\n\u201cRather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing our nation, the Presidency is busy engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, imperative to state that the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically elected governments.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the Presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood\u201d, the party said.\n\nFor elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, the Buhari administration was only embarking on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue, adding that he does not support any change of government other than through the ballot box.\n\nYakasai said: \u201cIt is not enough to embark on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue.

          "text": "The Presidency has come under fire over its Tuesday allegation that it has evidence that some \u2018disruptive elements\u2019 are planning to recruit ethnic groups and politicians to pass a vote of no confidence on the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe allegation by the Presidency, though came short of directly accusing the \u2018disruptive elements\u2019, which it described as religious leaders and former political leaders, of planning to overthrow the Buhari administration, its use of words, including earlier statements by the Military and the Department of State Services (DSS), were read by Nigerians, including prominent members of the Nigerian society and groups, to mean that the Presidency was alluding to an overthrow of the government.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Robert Clark obviously stirred the hornets nest when, during a television interview, suggested that the military should take over government temporarily in order to restructure the country.\n\nClark\u2019s, suggestion, though unpopular with Nigerians, came on the heels of growing discontent in the country over worsening insecurity that has led to unprecedented fear in the country, and calls for President Buhari to rein in the criminal elements terrorising Nigerians.\n\nMr. Femi Adesina, the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, in a statement on Tuesday, said the motive behind the plan by the \u2018disruptive elements\u2019 was to throw the country into further turmoil.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Department of State Services on Sunday alerted on sinister moves by misguided elements to wreak havoc on the government, sovereignty and corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cChampioned by some disgruntled religious and past political leaders, the intention is to eventually throw the country into a tailspin, which would compel a forceful and undemocratic change of leadership.\n\n\u201cFurther unimpeachable evidence shows that these disruptive elements are now recruiting the leadership of some ethnic groups and politicians round the country, with the intention of convening some sort of conference, where a vote of no confidence would be passed in the President, thus throwing the land into further turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe caterwauling, in recent times, by these elements, is to prepare the grounds adequately for their ignoble intentions, which are designed to cause further grief for the country.\n\n\u201cThe agent provocateurs hope to achieve through artifice and sleight of hands, what they failed to do through the ballot box in the 2019 elections.\u201d\n\nPeeved by the allegation by the presidency, several Nigerians and groups, including the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Afenifere, the Yoruba sociocultural group, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), among others, have come hard on the presidency, accusing it of heating up the polity and reading meanings to every sincere comment and advice by Nigerians.\n\nFor the ACF, it was uncharitable for the Presidency to see and call every dissenting voice or perceived critics of the All Progressives Congress (APC) government as disgruntled elements.\n\nThe group, which spoke through its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, said the Presidency has a penchant for viewing every critic with dark motives, which it said was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency must be broad-minded enough to accommodate all shades of opinions. The criticism is done in good faith and if acted upon will help improve the situation in the country. It is wrong to see all critics as disgruntled, religious and past political leaders with dark motives. Some of them mean well for the government and the country\u201d, the ACF spokesman said.\n\nPANDEF on it\u2019s part, accused the Presidency of chasing shadows instead of looking for how to surmount the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nAccording to PANDEF\u2019s spokesman, Ken Robinson, tagging religious leaders and past political leaders as disgruntled elements under the current security situation in the country was shocking and least expected.\n\n\u201cPANDEF cautions that the Presidency should stop chasing shadows. Citizens are anxious and troubled, many are becoming hopeless, with even the security agencies seemingly helpless and vulnerable\u201d, Robinson said.\n\nFor the PDP, the statement from the Presidency only shows that President Buhari and the ruling APC were being haunted by their shadows, insisting that they are afraid of experiencing what they did to others in the past.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP added that the allegation by the Presidency was only a desperate attempt by the Buhari administration to blackmail Nigerians to cover up for its failures.\n\n\u201cRather than live up to the responsibilities of office by taking charge and securing our nation, the Presidency is busy engaging in frivolous allegations against Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, imperative to state that the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress are being haunted by their own shadows as Nigerians know the persons as well as the political party with the history and penchant to scuttle democratically elected governments.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the Presidency has forgotten that in 1983, Brigadier Muhammadu Buhari, as he was then known, led a military coup to truncate a democratically elected government thereby causing our nation a huge drawback on democratic governance.\n\n\u201cAlso, in 2015, the APC, which was hurriedly formulated, made itself available as a vehicle of brigandage to disrupt our political process by beguiling Nigerians and taking power through violence, propaganda and falsehood\u201d, the party said.\n\nFor elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, the Buhari administration was only embarking on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue, adding that he does not support any change of government other than through the ballot box.\n\nYakasai said: \u201cIt is not enough to embark on scaremongering by issuing statements on such a serious issue. We have yet to recover from the violent overthrow of the Tafawa Balewa-led first Republic by young military officers. I do not support any change of government other than that which comes through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe apex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, also distanced itself from the allegation by the Presidency, saying it is not interested in anything coup.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, however, said that even the President himself knows that all was not well with the country.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze is not interested in anything coup. Ohanaeze is interested that the President should listen to us and address the nation. The President should reorder his steps. He should root his governance in justice because everything has become injustice especially to the Igbo,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum (MBF), on it\u2019s part, viewed the allegation by the Presidency as an insult to the sensibilities of Nigerians, reminding the President that Nigeria was operating a democratic system of government.\n\nThe group\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Dr Isuwa Dogo said: \u201cWe view the statement as an expression of guilt by the Presidency for the deteriorating situation of things in the country including insecurity and its inability to stop it.\u201d\n\nFor the Afenifere, the allegation was a non issue, as its leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo insisted that Afenifere and other sociocultural groups in the South are only interested in the peaceful restructuring of the country.\n\n\u201cWho is interested in passing a vote of no confidence in Buhari? Who has confidence in Buhari before let alone pass any vote of no confidence in him\u201d, Adebanjo asked.\n\nExpectedly, Nigerians took to the social media, especially the micro blogging site, Twitter to express their anger and views on the allegation from the Presidency, with most declaring that it was a mere propaganda to divert attention from the real issues begging for attention.\n\nFor many, the allegation was also in line with the known blame game of the Buhari administration.\n\nFor Twitter user @IdorenyinEtuk5, an amendment of the Nigerian constitution to allow for citizens to call for early elections if not happy with government\u2019s performance would have exposed the Buhari administration.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cLet presidency call for amendment to the constitution to allow for citizens to call for early elections if they are dissatisfied with their govt and let\u2019s see how Buhari will fair since they are worried about calls for Buhari\u2019s removal as if it were illegal. DSS are so worthless to have said that it was a threat to national security. Same DSS that has nothing to offer where real threats to citizens are concerned. DSS must be scrapped, all its point men and women sacked.\u201d\n\nFor @Abdultiggi, if removing the President will bring solution to the problems in the country, so be it. He wrote: \u201cIf by removing him will bring solution to the country then why not? Insecurity is killing our nation\u201d, while @cthereality, concurred with him, declaring the statement from the Presidency was a cheap propaganda.\n\n\u201cMy brother, this is the cheapest propaganda I\u2019ve ever heard. Instead of facing the reality on ground, they\u2019re busy raising false alarm. All we need is security. If they can\u2019t secure us, what options do we have?\u201d, he said.\n\nFor @sticksnsnares, removing the President to have a secure Nigeria is a welcome idea.

They also have important players coming back. I am expecting Arsenal to be at their best individually and collectively.\n\n\u201cWe are going into the game with the idea of being ourselves, and when we need to dig in, try and win the duels, be solid in covers and fight with them for the control of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we will see a more dangerous Arsenal side than in the first leg. We want to show personality, a clear identity and to be competitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a nice moment, in the Europa League, we have had a good journey. We have been mature, solid and consistent in every tie. We want to do that again. Our aim is to build on the first leg.\u201d\n\nVillarreal, who have never reached the final of the Champions League or Europa League, have put together a promotional video ahead of the clash against Arsenal starring Pau Torres, with the message: \u201cLet\u2019s flip the script\u2026 It\u2019s our time.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the fans, I will say that it is going to be very difficult, but we are ready to face that difficulty,\u201d Emery added.\n\n\u201cWe want to enjoy the tie. We are going with all the excitement of the fans and we can promise them that we will play with pride, we know that we\u2019re defending this club\u2019s beautiful history. Tomorrow, we have a historic chance and we will face it with our all and the desire to reach a final.\u201d\n\nWhile Arsenal and Villarreal fans face a nervy night, Manchester United are virtually assured of a place in the final of a competition they won in 2017 after hammering Roma 6-2 in the first leg.",

After the civil war in 1970, God blessed the whole world then especially those that were oil producing countries.

Ejike Mbaka. has said he was not arrested or detained by security agents.\n\nThe cleric, who arrived to a rousing welcome at the Adoration Ground around 7:15pm told faithful he was invited to a meeting with the Bishop of Enugu Catholic Diocese, Callistus Onaga, where he was ordered to vacate the adoration ground and remain silent for 30 days.\n\nHe said he was surprised to see other persons at the meeting which he thought was only between him and the Bishop.\n\nHe said there was a plan to shut the adoration ground over his recent comments against the government.\n\n\u201cThey ordered me to leave the Adoration Ground for 30 days; to be silent for 30 days and to leave Enugu. Their plan was to even send me to Rome after the 30 days.\n\n\u201cI asked them why I was being punished. They cannot not tell me who to bless. They are angry that I blessed Nnamdi Kanu. I am a priest of God and nobody can tell me who to bless. Is it your blessing? Are you the one giving him life? Are you the one giving him life? Go and take away God\u2019s blessings from him.\n\n\u201cIf you said I spoke against government is there no insecurity in the country? Are they angry that I said government should provide jobs for the youths? I am a priest of God and I will continue to bless and speak the truth.\n\n\u201cI saw the implication of keeping me there. I told them that my people will look for me if they don\u2019t allow me to attend today\u2019s programme (E no dey again).\n\n\u201cWhat would have happened if I had has left Enugu as they instructed? We are a people of peace so I want you all to be peaceful. We wilI meet here again on Sunday God willing.\u201d\n\nPandemonium had broken out, yesterday, as thousands of adherents took to the streets seeking the whereabouts of the fiery priest.\n\nHis followers had stormed the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Bishop Callistus Onaga, demanding his whereabouts.\n\nAccording to the protesters, Bishop had invited Mbaka for a meeting by 10am on Tuesday and they had neither seen nor heard from him since then.\n\nThe cleric, however, showed up at about 2:50pm as tension was reaching a breaking point on his whereabouts with many alleging that government was complicit in his \u2018disappearance\u2019.\n\nHe emerged at the junction of Igboeze Street where he alighted from an SUV and urged protesters to return to Adoration Ground in Umuchigbo for him to address them. It was learnt that the priest may have emerged from the Government House axis of Enugu.\n\nEyewitnesses said having received no positive response and fearing that the bishop may have handed the priest to security agents, the protesters had descended on Bishop\u2019s Court, residence of Bishop Onaga, and vandalised property, especially glasses, doors, the Bishop\u2019s office before marching to destroy a bookshop, guest house, two buildings, four big water tanks and other facilities at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Some workers there sustained various degrees of injury.\n\nThere was heavy presence of joint security forces of the army, police, National Security and Civil Defence Corps and the Department of State Services both at the Bishop\u2019s Court and the Holy Ghost Cathedral.\n\nDSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, had denied that Mbaka was in their custody.\n\nFears of his possible arrest arose as Mbaka last week Wednesday called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over worsening security challenges in the country.\n\nLast Sunday, the DSS issued a warning to individuals and groups to be mindful of utterances and actions that threatened the country\u2019s peace and sovereignty.",

          "text": "\u2022Propose percentage payment of statutory allocation to legislative arm\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nGovernors have shifted ground in their quest for an earnest resolution of the industrial crisis caused by the clamour by judicial and legislative workers for the implementation of financial autonomy for the two arms of government.\n\nTHISDAY gathered yesterday that the governors had proposed to pay lawmakers a certain percentage of their statutory monthly entitlements towards funding the legislature.\n\nA source said the governors\u2019 offer followed the refusal of speakers of Houses of Assembly of the 36 states of the federation to accept the N100 million monthly offer made by the governors for each state legislature.\n\nIn rejecting the irreducible minimum payment of N100 million monthly to each of the legislatures in the states to fund their operations, the speakers had insisted on N250 million monthly.\n\nIt was also gathered that the governors had also rejected the demand of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) that the gross allocations should be remitted to the two arms of government directly.\n\nThe governors\u2019 hard-line position was said to be responsible for the delay in the resolution of the strike embarked upon by judicial and parliamentary workers in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to press for the implementation of financial autonomy for state judiciaries and legislatures.\n\nHowever, the governors agreed that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will handle funds for states\u2019 judicial councils to take care of the high courts while the state governments will be responsible for funding the magistrates and customary courts.\n\nIn a bid to resolve the issues and end the ongoing industrial dispute, the federal government has invited the leadership of JUSUN and PASAN to a negotiation today.\n\nA statement by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, said the Minister, Senator Chris Ngige, would host the negotiations with the workers.\n\nAn earlier plan to hold talks with the striking workers was stalled by a lack of harmony in the positions of the team representing the federal government and that of governors.\n\nThe Solicitor-General of the Federation, Mr. Dayo Apata, who had represented the federal government, and the Director-General of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Mr. Asishana Okauru, had presented different position papers, which stalled negotiations.\n\nBut a source told THISDAY yesterday that the two parties had reached a consensus, while all the grey areas have been resolved.\n\nHe confirmed that Ngige would schedule a meeting with the leadership of JUSUN and PASAN to sort out any other outstanding issues.\n\nHe said: \u201cRight now; there\u2019s a consensus. There\u2019s some agreement, grey areas have been cleared and I think the minister is committed to putting a meeting together with the workers and in the next couple of days. I think all the grey areas will be sorted out.\n\n\u201cSome of the grey areas for the judiciary, for instance, is that it is clear to all the parties now that the National Judicial Council (NJC) will be handling that because that\u2019s the position of the constitution. They have been doing that for recurrent at the state level, but have not been doing it for capital spending.\n\n\u201cThat will continue, especially for courts of record. The governors will be in charge of customary courts and magistrates courts.\n\n\u201cFor the legislature, the major issue was whether the deduction should be based on gross or net. What they have agreed is that it is going to be an agreed percentage of appropriated amount.\u201d\n\nFollowing the different positions adopted by the federal government and the governors, Ngige had urged the governors to rework the agreement for negotiations to resume.\n\nThe governors had accepted in principle the funding of both the state legislatures and judiciaries from their allocations from the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), to be deducted from the States Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC).\n\nAs part of its implementation, the state governments were expected from May 1, to set up the States Accounts Allocations Committee (SAAC) with members from the states Assembly committee chairmen on Finance and the States Commissioners of Finance to discuss on monthly basis the disbursement of funds.\n\nHowever, the governors and speakers could not reach a consensus on how much to be given to each state legislature monthly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges release of kidnapped Greenfield university scholars\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed excitement at the news of the release of the remaining 29 students of the Federal College of Forestry, Afaka, Kaduna abducted from their school 55 days ago.\n\nChairman of the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students, Mr. Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the release of the students to THISDAY.\n\n\u201cYes, they have been released. They did not sleep in the (bandits) camp yesterday. They were taken to the residence of one of the mediators to sleep. We have already sent our people with vehicles and ambulances to go and bring them. We are expecting them any moment from now,\u201d Usman said.\n\nThe bandits had invaded the school on March 11 and abducted 39 of the students.\n\nThey later freed 10 of them in two batches of five after the parents had reportedly paid N17 million ransoms.\n\nUsman described the release of the students as \u201ca big relief to parents,\u201d who have been emotionally traumatised since the incident.\n\nThe parents had on Tuesday protested at the National Assembly in Abuja.\n\nHowever, attempts to confirm the release of the students from the police were unsuccessful as Mr. Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command was unreachable on the telephone.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the release of the students was nearly frustrated following a claim by one of the parents during their protest in Abuja on Tuesday that they paid N800, 000 to one of the mediators.\n\nA source among the parents told THISDAY that the claim by the woman that they paid N800, 000 to an associate of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi nearly stalled the negotiation process.\n\nHe said the allegation angered Gumi and others helping to ensure the release of the students and they were not taking their calls.\n\nAccording to him, the woman was not part of the meeting with Gumi and wondered how she got such unfounded information.\n\nThe woman had said that the parents were taken to Gumi, who directed them to a Fulani man named Ahmed.\n\nShe said the parents paid N800, 000 to the man but the man said the money was for transportation and insisted that they should pay an additional N500 million.\n\nHowever, the source who said he was part of the negotiations, stated that the woman made her comments out of ignorance.\n\n\u201cThat woman made that unfortunate comment out of ignorance. It is just side talks. She was not at the meeting with Gumi; so, she didn\u2019t know what happened at the meeting. She just heard what some people are talking about at the corner,\u201d he said.\n\nThe parents of the 39 students later issued a statement dismissing the claims that they gave out N800, 000 to the Fulani man, who was recommended by Gumi.\n\nIn the statement issued in Kaduna, the parents said: \u201cThe claim has no basis.\u201d\n\nThe statement jointly signed Mr. Abdullahi Usman and Ms. Catherine Saleh, Chairman and Secretary respectively of the parents\u2019 union, also apologised to Gumi, \u201cfor any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement said though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, \u201cher claim is untrue,\u201d, as she was not a member of the (negotiation) committee representing the parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\u201d\n\nBuhari Excited\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari expressed happiness with the release of the students yesterday.\n\nHe also pleaded with the kidnappers to effect the release of the abducted students of Greenfield University also in Kaduna and other Nigerians being held in captivity.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, congratulated the released students\u2019 friends, families and the government and people of Kaduna State following the happy end to the saga.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are happy they have been released,\u201d while also expressing deep appreciation to all the actors who contributed one way or the other to the happy outcome, \u201cin particular the defence and security agencies, the officials of the Ministry of Environment and the government of Kaduna State. We thank Nigerians for their prayers.\u201d\n\nHe called for steadfastness and security awareness on the part of citizens and the law enforcement agencies and deplored the increasing politicization of security in the country by opportunistic politicians.\n\nHe appealed for the release of the students of Greenfield University and all other citizens held in captivity, expressing the strong determination of his administration to ensure that Nigerians lived in a country where everyone can move where they want, when they want without the fear of kidnapping and banditry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Elumelu Calls for Urgent Power Sector Reforms to Boost Economy",
          "text": "\u2022Commends CBN on FX management\n\nBy Nume Ekeghe, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc Group Chairman and Founder, Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Mr. Tony Elumelu, has called for urgent reforms in the power sector to boost economic activities.\n\nElumelu, who is also the Chairman of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria, also urged the federal government to invest more in electricity supply in order to create an avenue for innovation and economic development.\n\nHe spoke yesterday during an interview on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcasting arm of THISDAY Newspapers and lauded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its foreign exchange management strategy as well as efforts to unify exchange rates.\n\nHe stressed the need for the federal government to focus on diversifying the economy in a bid to increase the country\u2019s forex inflow and reduce the dependence on oil revenue.\n\nAlso, responding to question on insider loan in companies he served as chairman, Elumelu stated that strict corporate governance are upheld in all the organisations.\n\nCommenting on the need for reforms in the power sector, he listed the three components of power supply as generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nHe said Nigerians would do better in business and creativity if they had steady electricity supply.\n\nHe decried the situation where inadequate electricity supply was crippling innovation and the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTranscorp through Transcorp Power and Afam Power today in Nigeria own the highest generating capacity in Nigeria that can generate 2,000 MW of electricity per day. But unfortunately, we do less than 500MW at this point in time and the major constraint in this area is gas; then there is the issue of transmission and there is the issue of payment.\n\n\u201cFor this to work well and for us to generate more, we need to have gas and our group has invested in oil and gas. And so, for us as a group, it is not necessarily for oil, it is because of gas because we want to be able to ensure that we have gas from our oil and gas production to convert to electricity.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition we did recently, I\u2019m happy to say, it is already supplying gas to our power plant. But going back to the subsidiary element, the issue of transmission, we need to make sure we stabilise our transmission for take-up.\u201d\n\nHe said Transcorp invested in the power sector to help Nigerians have access to electricity because businesses across all sectors of the economy like health, e-commerce, manufacturing, SMEs, among others, need power.\n\n\u201cThey cannot grow their businesses without adequate electricity.\n\nNigerian and African youths are multi-talented, but they need a steady electricity supply to be creative and innovative,\u201d he said.\n\nElumelu said if the government improves access to electricity in Nigeria, the Nigerian youths will create the Nigerian version of Silicon Valley and the likes of Steve Job and Bill Gates, explaining that what is holding Nigerian youths to a large extent is the lack of adequate electricity.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs at least 100,000 MW of electricity a day to power the economy but today we operate less than 5,000 MW and we need to do more,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cGovernment, therefore, needs to create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nHe commended the CBN and its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for the support given in the area of metering.\n\nHe said to drive the economy, power generation has to be increased by fixing the gas supply to generating companies, adding that there was the need to make sure that the transmission lines are utilised to evacuate the power as well as ensure that power generated is taken by Discos and the end-users and they pay.\n\nThe business mogul said: \u201cPower is still a critical sector; we need to invest and the stakeholders need to make sure that it works. And when it works, the country\u2019s economic development becomes more real.\n\n\u201cEvery sector of our economy needs the power sector and I think we need to prioritise it more. But I commend efforts going on and also by making sure we privatise the remaining ones. The transmission lines need to be fixed and we need to make sure we improve the payment system.\u201d\n\nHe advocated the privatisation of the entire value-chain of the power sector.\n\nElumelu stated: \u201cThe area of privatising the transmission lines, I think that ultimately, it should be privatised. What some of us have advocated is that the Gencos, the Discos and the entire power stakeholders should come together and have a deal with the federal government to take over the transmission lines and it would be in our self-interest to make sure it works.\n\n\u201cWe have the transmission lines and it doesn\u2019t work when you are generating, there is no way you would evacuate your power. That sector is so critical and pivotal for the survival of the power sector. It is critical to improving access to electricity, and where it is now there is no problem but what is important to us is that we have expanded capacity.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the recent development at First Bank Nigeria Limited, Elumelu declined to make a comment.\n\nBut he said the decisions arrived at in resolving the board crisis in the bank were appropriate and beneficial to all major stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou need to understand the unique situation of this question. I am chairman of a competing institution and it may not be prudent for me to express a judgment or comment on this because it may not be very professional of me.\n\n\u201cBut I know the shareholders of the bank, and I also know the regulatory mindset, and the regulators want a safe banking environment and I believe the shareholders also seek that in due course, I believe they would be able to resolve the issues. I must say the banking sector has done very well, both the regulatory part and the participants.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions on if UBA is exposed to insider trading and lending with his other businesses, he stated that his oil and gas interests were financed by a consortium of local and international banks, excluding UBA.\n\nIn addition, his other ventures have exposure below the threshold and the loans are serviced.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe oil and gas acquisition we just made, UBA did not participate in the funding. It is a club of international and local lenders. The local receiving bank for our proceeds is Union Bank of Nigeria and the international receiving bank of our oil sales is Standard Chartered Bank, London.\n\n\u201cThe transaction was funded by consortium of banks \u2013 Standard Chartered, ABSA IN South Africa, Afrexim, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank in Nigeria and a host of other international banks. So, we are mindful of all this and we are very prudent in making sure we do not put pressure on the bank.\n\n\u201cWe also put in equity investment and when we need to get investment, we try not to put pressure on the institution. What is important is that it is within the limit UBA should be exposed to a company and it is by the way performing very well. Our loans are performing very well.\u201d\n\nOn CBN forex management strategy, Elumelu said he supported efforts being made by the regulator to achieve convergence of rates.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo years ago, our vice president conveyed a meeting of a few of us to express our opinion and talk on the economy. The position then was quite critical at the time. But today, when things have improved, you should be also critical to say that things are moving in the right direction. On the convergence, I support it 100 per cent and I think we are there.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in the saddle or seat you would see things more differently. For Nigeria, we generate foreign currency largely from oil. We used to produce around 2.5 million barrels before and today, we are doing 1.4 million barrels per day and that should have an impact on our foreign currency which is no rocket science.\n\n\u201cAlso, there was a time oil was $100 per barrel and it dropped to almost $40 per barrel and today it is at $69 per barrel. So, there is a basket of so many things we have to watch as economic managers in making decisions and there is a lot of pressure on our foreign currency.\n\n\u201cWhat people want to see from outside is a low exchange rate, but from the business world, people want to predict that this would be available and I think to a large extent, it is happening\n\nElumelu, who also spoke about the ease of doing business in Nigeria, said government must improve on its policy to attract more investors.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that investors, who are looking for where to invest their money, will go to countries where the policy on the ease of doing business is investor-friendly. The private sector must also work with government to ensure that the ease of doing business in Nigeria improves,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\nSpeaking on the impact of Tony Elumelu Foundation, Elumelu said it was established seven years ago to empower young Nigerians and Africans, stressing that the future of Africa remains in the hands of the youth who have key roles to play in developing Nigeria and the continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cI strongly feel it will be a waste of resources to save so much money in banks without using such money to empower people, especially when there is poverty among the masses. It is for this reason that we established Tony Elumelu Foundation to empower young people and make successful businesses out of them.\n\n\u201cEvery year, the foundation supports young people with a seed capital of $5,000 each, which is non-refundable and the foundation supports 1,000 people every year. We train them for 12 weeks and appoint business mentors for them and we create a networking platform for them to interact and grow their business ideas.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the foundation gets support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union, stressing that the EU recently released $25 million.\n\nHe said the fund would be used for the next batch of trainees.\n\nElumelu stated that about 10, 000 Nigerians, including other Africans, have benefited from the training offered by the Tony Elumelu Foundation in the last seven years.\n\nOn the issue of girl-child education, Elumelu said there was a need to close the gap on gender inequality.\n\n\u201cI am a direct beneficiary of women\u2019s impact in molding the society, through the training I received from my mother, and cherish to support the girl-child education in order to bridge gender inequality,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nGiving details of his exit from UBA as managing director and chief executive officer, Elumelu said the orders came from the then CBN Governor, Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who felt that all bank CEOs that had served for 10 years, should step aside at that time.\n\n\u201cThat day, we had a Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting and at the end of the meeting, the then CBN Governor, Lamido Sanusi, told me that CEOs who had done 10 years will step aside. I called the chairman to explain what happened and the next day, we conveyed an emergency board meeting. At the board meeting, it was a divided household for the first time; some directors said \u2018no, we have to go to court to contest it\u2019 and about one or two other directors did not think so. But I spoke and I told the board members that there are five critical stakeholders here \u2013 the customers of UBA \u2013 will they like to know that we took our regulator to court? No, then the staff of UBA; will they be comfortable working in a bank that took their regulator to court? No, then the shareholders, then the regulators themselves, they wouldn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cSo, four constituents will not like us going to court. There is only one constituent that may like it and that\u2019s Tony Elumelu, which makes it one over five, and that is 20 per cent, and it\u2019s not enough to go to court,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, however, said he was already planning to exit as the bank\u2019s CEO at the age of 50, before the directive came, adding that within 24 hours of CBN directive, the bank appointed his successor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Here are five updates about the pandemic this Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden backs waiver for COVID-19 patent\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Wednesday backed waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, a move that would allow more countries manufacture the jabs.\n\n\u201cThe Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d Katherine Tai, Biden trade negotiator, wrote in a statement.\n\nBiden and some world leaders had faced pressure from medical experts and World Health Organisation (WHO) to share technology and rights with vaccines manufacturers in poor and middle-income countries to boost production and speed up the response to the pandemic.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, described the waiver as a \u201cmonumental moment\u201d in response to the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a monumental moment in the fight against #COVID19. The commitment by @POTUS Joe Biden & @USTradeRep @AmbassadorTai to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 leadership to address global health challenges. pic.twitter.com/3iBt3jfdEr \u2014 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) May 5, 2021\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModerna vaccine booster increases antibodies against COVID variants\n\nModerna says early human trial data shows that a third dose of either its current COVID-19 jab or a booster shot increases immunity against variants of COVID-19 first found in Brazil and South Africa.\n\nThe booster shots were given to 40 volunteers who had already been vaccinated six to eight months prior.\n\nBlood tests showed that half of the volunteers had a low antibody response against B.1.351 and the P.1 variant first seen in Brazil before they got the booster shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModerna said two weeks after the booster, their antibody levels grew against the \u201cwild type coronavirus\u201d \u2014 the variant most common around the world \u2014 as well as B.1.351 and P.1.\n\nNigeria confirms 58 COVID-19 infections\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says the country recorded 52 new cases across six states and the federal capital territory (FCT) on Wednesday.\n\nThis is the highest number of new cases recorded this week. The country reported 28 cases on Sunday, 18 infections on Monday while 34 cases were recorded on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe zero deaths streak for seven consecutive days ended, with two new deaths reported on Wednesday. The total number of fatalities now stands at 2,065.\n\nTaraba had the highest number of cases on Wednesday with 18 infections.\n\nHowever, NCDC said \u201ctoday\u2019s (Wednesday) report includes data from Taraba state recorded between 22nd April and 4th May, 2021\u201d.\n\nOther states that recorded cases include FCT (9), Rivers (9), Lagos (7), Akwa Ibom (6), Kano (2), and Kaduna (1).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, 32 persons were discharged on Wednesday, bringing the total number of recoveries to 155,403.\n\nAccording to the agency, Nigeria now has 165,273 confirmed cases.\n\nCanada approves Pfizer COVID vaccine for children aged 12-15\n\nCanada has authorised Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for use in children between the age of 12 and 15.\n\nSupriya Sharma, an adviser at the Canadian ministry of health, said the vaccine is safe and effective in the younger age group.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d she said.\n\nTokyo may extend COVID emergency\n\nThe Tokyo metropolitan government is said to be considering extending the ongoing state of emergency to curb the spike in COVID-19 infections.\n\nAccording to Kyodo news agency, the metropolitan government is expected to make a final decision after hearing opinions from health experts on Thursday.\n\nCOVID-19 IN NIGERIA",

We call ourselves the giant of Africa and yet we are the least represented both at the national and state levels of assemblies.\n\n\u201cHaving this bill passed will make a big difference in the development of our country, because we can see the development going fast in countries where we have more women participation at the helm of leadership and Nigeria should not be an exception.\u201d",

          "text": "Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu started Carry1st in 2018 to publish mobile games and interactive content for Africans. One of their games, Carry1st Trivia, got a lot of buzz in 2020 with about one and a half million downloads.\n\nIn the three years since its launch, Carry1st has also become a medium for bringing mobile gaming from global companies to Africa. The Cape Town-based company realised that developers have had problems with distribution and payments in Africa.\n\nThey decided to solve that by embedding a fintech solution, Pay1st, on their platform. Pay1st features popular payment methods from six African countries, giving African gamers on Carry1st the ability to pay how they want.\n\nThe result is a company that is a publishing platform for games but also a full-stack management solution for game developers seeking user acquisition, marketing and monetization in Africa.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we were able to successfully sign 7 great titles, recruit a top-notch international team, and build out our payments and digital commerce platform,\u201d Robbin-Coker, CEO of Carry1st, said in a statement.\n\nRight to Left: Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tinotenda Mundangepfupfu, Carry1st co-founders. Image source: Carry1st.\n\nNow the startup is positioned to take advantage of the stability and opportunity they have found. They have announced the close of a $6 million Series A round led by Konvoy Ventures, an early-stage VC firm based in the US State of Colorado. Carry1st joins a list of other gaming companies on Konvoy\u2019s portfolio.\n\nJackson Vaughan, Managing Partner at Konvoy Ventures, joins Carry1st\u2019s board as a result of the investment. He said Carry1st\u2019s advantage is in \u201capproaching sub-regions with contextual understanding.\u201d\n\nOther investors in the round include Riot Games (the company behind \u2018League of Legends\u2019), Raine Ventures, AET Fund / Akatsuki and TTV Capital.\n\nWith this round, Carry1st has now raised $9.5m since it was founded. The most recent funding round before this was in May 2020 when they raised $2.5million from a seed round led by CRE Venture Capital.\n\nCarry1st plans to enter new partnerships with global gaming studios. Their existing partnerships cut across continents: with Raketspel in Sweden, New York-based Cosi Games, and Ethiopian developer Qene Games.\n\nThey also intend to launch new games and scale existing ones. To achieve that, they plan to hire more staff for product, engineering, and growth. The strategy is welcome by their latest investors.\n\n\u201cAt Riot, we have seen first hand the importance of partnering with local experts to bring the best possible gaming experience to players,\u201d Brendan Mulligan, Head of Corporate Development at Riot Games, said.\n\n\u201cAs the number of gamers in Africa explodes, we\u2019re excited to work with Cordel and Carry1st as they introduce game developers from all over the world to an important and passionate audience.\u201d\n\nCarry1st could be an engine for driving the mobile gaming economy in Africa, tapping into a growing global wave.\n\n36% of all mobile app downloads in 2020 were mobile games, according to App Annie, the mobile apps analytics company. 70% of all app purchases on the Apple store and Google Play in 2020 was on games.\n\nThe upward trajectory in mobile game spend is set to continue this year, reaching $120 billion.",

          "text": "Lami, a Kenyan insurtech company democratizing insurance products and services for low-income Kenyans, has raised $1.8 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Accion Venture Lab.\n\nFounded by Jihan Abass in 2018, Lami is a digital insurance platform that enables partner businesses \u2013 including banks, tech companies, and other entities to easily and seamlessly offer digital insurance products to their users via its API.\n\nLami can also be used by partner businesses to manage their own insurance needs. Through its API, users can get a quotation for motor, medical, or other tailored insurance products in seconds, then customize the benefits and adjust the premium to suit their needs. They get their policy documents instantly and claims are paid in record time.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal Abass said, \u201cSimilar to a payment API/gateway, we process insurance KYC, pricing of products, underwriting of products and claims processing in real time. Let me give you an example, Jumia wanted to launch an insurance marketplace but they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of integrating with every single insurance company and they didn\u2019t want to manage the process of issuing policies. Using our API because we have 20 insurance companies on our platform, they were able to launch this marketplace with a large number of products.\u201d\n\nJulian Abbas Founder & CEO\n\nThe Insurance space in Africa\n\nWith a 3% penetration rate (except for South Africa), Africa\u2019s insurance market is lagging behind. In Kenya where Lami is based less than 20% of the population has access to health insurance.\n\nThe major cause of the low adoption is that most insurance providers on the continent fail to offer flexible, affordable and tailored insurance coverage that can provide a safety net for the African consumer. For example, under most health policies customers face restrictions on what facilities and treatments are covered, they struggle to understand coverage terms and face complicated and lengthy claims processes. This results in a longer processing cycle, poor customer satisfaction, and higher distribution costs.\n\nLami\u2019s services are enabled by its flexible insurance rating engine and direct integration with several parties and insurance companies. Lami co-designs innovative products with its underwriting partners to enable businesses to offer unique insurance products to their underlying customer base, with flexible options that meet their needs and cash flows, such as monthly medical policies for startup employees.\n\nLami\u2019s CEO Jihan Abass said, \u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more people, improving our technology, and growing our presence across Africa as we can continue to address the persistent insurance gap. At Lami, our vision is to help improve the financial resilience of millions by making insurance products more accessible and affordable for underserved populations. By enabling our business partners to offer customized insurance solutions, we are helping them provide more value to their customers, while enabling large volumes of users to access insurance, often for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe Lami team at work\n\nSince its inception, the insurtech startup has sold more than 5,000 policies and has partnered with more than 25 active underwriters, including Britam, Pioneer, and Madison Insurance, distributing more than 30 products available including medical, motor, employee benefits, and device insurance. As an innovator in the digital insurance space, Lami aims to continue diversifying its business by looking for new partners and building on its core technology.\n\nMichael Schlein, President and CEO, Accion Venture Lab, said, \u201cNinety-seven percent of Africans lack access to insurance \u2013 a financial safety net that can help them build resilience against economic shocks. Lami helps address this need for consumers across Africa through its innovative approach that leverages technology and partnerships to help any business develop and sell insurance.\u201d\n\nWithin the past month Malian insurtech OKO and Nigerian insurtech Curacel raised a combined amount of $1.6 million, Lami\u2019s funding news is a reminder that there\u2019s some activity in the African insurtech space. Also, with less than 5% of venture capital going to female-led startups in 2019, it\u2019s positive news to see another female-led company being funded.",

This announcement marks the fourth time the government has adjusted the NIN registration deadline since the first call on December 30, 2020.\n\nThe country\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami and other industry stakeholders held a virtual meeting and concluded that an additional 8-week extension will give Nigerians more time to get their NIN and complete supplementary data verification processes.\n\nSince the first call for registration, a significant amount of progress has been made. An estimated 54 million Nigerians have obtained their NINs. When you do the math, 54 million registrants translate to about 190 million mobile numbers with linked NINs. This is deduced from the empirical data that suggest that each unique NIN maps three to four phone numbers.\n\nA statement by the NIMC reveals that moving forward, an \u201candroid enrollment system\u201d will be deployed to improve the speed and ease of enrollment. Furthermore, the NIMC says that telecommunication providers and other registration agents have opened centres across the country to aid the process as well.\n\nUntil recently, the NIN registration process put the sale of new SIM cards by telcos on hold, allowing Nigeria\u2019s federal government to carry out a comprehensive audit of the Subscriber Registration Database. However, the government has since lifted the ban on new sim registration on the condition that new subscribers have their NIN.\n\nThe June 30th deadline gives unregistered mobile subscribers some breathing room, but it\u2019s unlikely that a majority of them will complete their registration before the newly announced revised date.",

She further noted that in line with the United Nations Millennium Development Goal, Rabawa hopes to empower at least 1 million unemployed or underemployed Africans by the year 2023 with their own businesses.\n\nThe Managing partner of Aptive Capital, Paul Brandon Gilpin, spoke excitedly about the recently secured investment. \u201cAt Aptive, we are out to identify talents and business models that work and then we invest. We are very impressed with Rabawa\u2019s deep knowledge of the market and their planned approach to solve the challenges of unemployment, poor product availability, high cost of logistics, access to market issues, and poverty across Africa.\n\nSince the fund commenced, Aptive Capital has invested in about 8 Startups with Rabawa being the 7th and biggest ticket size ($163,000) disbursed so far\u201d he stated. Aptive Capital\u2019s portfolio investments include startups like OneKiosk, SkyfireDigital, MimiMoney, Emmnoch Farms, Statesman, and Slabdeck who have received between $10,000 and $50,000 from the funds. Although unconfirmed, several business moves now hint at Aptive Capital\u2019s interest in participating in a currently undisclosed round of OneKiosk.\n\nWith its new funding round of $163,000, Rabawa has officially positioned itself to be become a key player in the Africa\u2019s e-commerce space by utilizing social and video commerce to build a sustainable business model that impact Africa socially and economically.\n\nMedia Contact: For more information, you may reach out to Rabawa via info@rabawa.com; Aptive Capital via info@aptivecapital.com",

          "text": "As part of its tradition to drive impactful conversations that lead to the development of Africa, the University of Oxford Africa Society is hosting its 2021 Oxford Africa Conference from May 28-30th, 2021.\n\nThis year\u2019s conference will feature prominent and world-class speakers from across political, social, economic, environmental, health, and technology spectrums, including Dr Toyin Saraki (Founder-President, The Wellbeing Foundation), Jose Massano (Angola\u2019s Central Bank Governor) and Minister Audu Ogbe (Nigeria\u2019s former minister of Agriculture). The conference\u2019s overarching theme is re-asserting Africa\u2019s story and creating opportunities from the prevalent challenges, rather than only discussing them.\n\nIn line with this objective, the conference\u2019s Innovation Fair, a five-year-old initiative within the Oxford Africa Conference, will take place on May 28th and 29th, 2021. This year, a cohort of 11 early-stage ventures from over 150 applications have been selected for the Fair.\n\nThese ventures operate in African countries across four sectors critical to the continent\u2019s post-pandemic future: creative (art, fashion, film etc.), education, healthcare, and sustainability. Prior to the Fair, the ventures will conduct strategy with the MBA cohort at Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. For the two days, the companies will receive networking opportunities, masterclasses, and mentorship. The Fair will culminate in a pitch competition where cash prizes will be awarded to the winners.\n\nThis pitch competition will be live streamed for conference attendees on Saturday, May 29, from 2 to 5 pm. Each pitch will include a 5-minute Q&A session with a judging panel made up of academics and investors connected to the University of Oxford.\n\nTo be part of these impactful programs, you can purchase a ticket to the conference here and gain access to world-class speakers and view exciting start-ups reshaping Africa\u2019s future.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nComments",

          "title": "Nigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions",
          "text": "After a 15% surge in crypto peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, according to a Nairametrics study in February, Africa\u2019s largest economy has recorded another all-time high in crypto p2p trading.\n\nAccording to a report by Vanguard, Nigeria now has a mind-boggling all-time trading volume of $1.5 billion on Paxful. Paxful is one of the biggest crypto P2P trading platforms globally.\n\nData from UsefulTulips, a website that explores the global use cases of cryptocurrencies, reveals that Nigeria transacted $99.1 million worth of Bitcoins in the first quarter of 2021. This figure surpasses Kenya\u2019s Bitcoin P2P transactions for the whole of 2020. Kenya comes in second with a Bitcoin P2P trading value worth $38.4 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGhana and South Africa rank third and fourth, respectively, with Bitcoin P2P transaction values of $27.4 million and $25.8 million\n\nGlobally, Nigeria sits with China, the US, India, and Kenya in Paxful\u2019s P2P rankings.\n\nThis comes as no surprise as Africa\u2019s most populous nation had been making waves on Paxful\u2019s P2P trading platform. Techpoint Africa earlier reported that Nigeria traded more than $566 million worth of bitcoins in the last five years, coming second to the US. In 2020, Paxful had over a million accounts registered from Nigeria.\n\nInteresting, a Techpoint Africa report, states that three crypto exchanges \u2014 Busha, BuyCoins, and Bitsika \u2014 claimed to have processed $219.2 million, $141.39 million, and $39.95 million, respectively. With a total of about $400,556,913 million, it is safe to say that perhaps the transactions are greater as other local exchanges did not disclose their transaction volumes.\n\nSurprisingly, the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN\u2019s) crypto ban in mid-February 2021, did nothing to reduce the volume of crypto activities in the country. If anything, crypto transactions seem to have increased significantly since.\n\nIn a press release dated February 7, 2021, the CBN claimed that cryptocurrencies pose risks of loss of investments and terrorism, among other disadvantages. However, the continuous rise in the use of digital currencies might prove that there is more to gain than lose.\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComments",
          "summary": "After a 15% surge in crypto peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, according to a Nairametrics study in February, Africa\u2019s largest economy has recorded another all-time high in crypto p2p trading.\nPaxful is one of the biggest crypto P2P trading platforms globally.\nThis figure surpasses Kenya\u2019s Bitcoin P2P transactions for the whole of 2020.\nThis comes as no surprise as Africa\u2019s most populous nation had been making waves on Paxful\u2019s P2P trading platform.\nIf anything, crypto transactions seem to have increased significantly since.",

Therefore, the way we think about university and the purpose of university must also change.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the role of technology in education and the role of technology in transforming lives. We cannot ignore that fact and continue to believe that it is not relevant.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge I am sure you will have to deal with is that of funding the university.

It has disappeared from our universities. It is disappointing to see the level of corruption in some of our universities.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Amal Pepple said that they have a huge task ahead of them, as they have a 60-day duration to submit their report.\n\nPepple, however, thanked the governor for the rehabilitation of some of the link roads within the campus and the renovation of the university hostels, which was used as the Games village for the just concluded National Sports Festival, tagged Edo 2020.\n\n...",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: How extortion, delay in getting court judgments frustrate justice in Nigeria",
          "text": "After the Kwara State High Court in Ilorin sentenced Rasaq Yusuf to death by hanging last November, he asked his lawyer to appeal the judgment. To enable him file the appeal within the three-month window, the lawyer, Ibrahim Gambari, immediately applied for a certified true copy (CTC) of the judgment delivered by Justice H.O Ajayi.\n\nBut Mr Gambari waited in vain for months for the copy and his client decided to forfeit his right to appeal the judgment.\n\nThe certified true copies of court judgments are stipulated by law to be made available within seven days. But lawyers told PREMIUM TIMES that they often wait for months to obtain the copies and sometimes miss the three-month deadline to file an appeal.\n\nThis, lawyers say, has become a big problem in the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria and led to denial of justice.\n\nIn the case of Mr Yusuf, it is not clear whether an appeal would have reversed his death sentence. He was arrested in 2015 at Tapa, a village in Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State, following a clash that caused the death of one Rasaki Kadiri.\n\nAfter five years of several adjournments, Mr Yusuf and one Ismaila Mustapha were sentenced to death by hanging on November 18, 2020.\n\n\u201cMay God have mercy on your souls. Amen,\u201d said Justice Ajayi of the state high when delivering the judgment.\n\nOn the day of the judgment, Mr Gambari applied for the CTC to prepare his appeal but waited for months until PREMIUM TIMES got involved in the matter.\n\nIn January, nearly two months after he first submitted the application, Mr Gambari told PREMIUM TIMES that court officials informed him that the court was occupied and the judge was yet to vet it.\n\nOn January 6, this newspaper submitted an application for the CTC of the same judgment as a concerned member of the public.\n\nThe court officials, who were unsure of this newspaper\u2019s interest in the case, were suddenly disturbed but still did not provide the needed document on time.\n\nAfter going through the request letter submitted by our reporter, a court official, later identified as Mrs Lawal, insisted that the judge had to assent to the application. A week after the application, Mrs Lawal told our reporter to forward the request to the Ministry of Justice, adding that the judge had rejected the request.\n\nAt the Ministry of Justice, an official directed our reporter to Ayoola Akande, the government lawyer who prosecuted the case.\n\n\u201cIt [the judgment] has been typed and given to the judge to proof-read before appending her signature. But as it is now, the judge is still proof-reading,\u201d Mr. Akande said. \u201cThat was the last thing we were told. They [the court officials] know we don\u2019t have the judgment. They know. We don\u2019t have a copy of the judgment as it is.\u201d\n\nAfter several reminders and visits to the court, Mr Gambari was able to get the CTC of the judgment on January 26, 70 days after his application and 20 days after PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 application.\n\n\u201cYour application was also part of the reason it came this early,\u201d Mr Gambari told PREMIUM TIMES. \u201cThey informed me that a journalist was involved.\u201d\n\nBut by this time, Mr Gambari\u2019s client had lost interest in the appeal.\n\n\u201cA lot of work is on our judges in and outside the court,\u201d Mr Gambari said. \u201cSo if our courts are digitised, it will lessen the burden of the judges. In fact, our judges of today need more than one legal assistant. If judgment has been typed already, the legal assistant can help with the vetting.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSuch delays had also frustrated Abdulrahman Yahaya, an Ibadan-based lawyer.\n\nHe told PREMIUM TIMES that his client, convicted of theft, was sentenced to three years in prison in 2014 but he could not appeal the judgment because they ran out of time waiting for the CTC.\n\n\u201cThey were dilly-dallying at the court registry,\u201d Mr Yahaya said. \u201cThe court officials showed me pepper for unknown reasons,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAlthough there have been improvements today compared to what we used to have then, I can still tell you that the system is not sane yet. These little foxes are eating the system up,\u201d he said.\n\nSame Delay For Civil Cases\n\nBabatunde Adebisi, a farmer in Ilawe Ekiti in Ekiti State, recalled how the delay in obtaining a CTC of a judgment forced him to forfeit two plots of land in 2015.\n\nThe smallholder farmer, who has now relocated to Ondo State, explained that when he lost the case over the ownership of the land at the Ekiti State High Court, he wanted to file an appeal to the higher court in Ado-Ekiti. But because the CTC of the judgment did not come on time, he missed the three-month deadline for an appeal.\n\nMr Adebisi said his lawyer told him that he was waiting for the copy for more than three months.\n\n\u201cI thought within myself that I was already spending more money than the value of the land. So, I just told him one day to withdraw,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Adebisi believed he could have reclaimed the land if he had been able to appeal the judgment. His lawyer, Simeon Olorunsogo, confirmed the incident and said the delay was due to some administrative challenges in the court then.\n\nAnother lawyer, Desmond Orisewezie, told PREMIUM TIMES that he had been working on an appeal that should have commenced but the delay in obtaining the certified true copy of the ruling of a lower court had stalled it.\n\nAlthough Mr Orisewesie did not give the details of the case owing to client confidentiality, he said he had submitted the application for the copy at the Federal High Court in Lagos since last November but was yet to obtain it as of April.\n\n\u201cI was trying to get the CTC of the ruling of a court delivered in November 2020. You know after putting out an application at the Federal High Court in Lagos, you know, even up till now, I\u2019m yet to get it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the Lagos-based attorney, the delay showed that there was a need for \u201cbetter efficiency on the part of court officials.\u201d\n\nNoel Brown\u2019s experience was at the National Industrial Court in Akure, Ondo State. He told PREMIUM TIMES that it took more than 90 days to obtain the judgment delivered by the court against his client.\n\n\u201cBut more often than not, you always get it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one or two judges might delay in giving the certified copies.\u201d\n\nExtortion in Oyo\n\nOur reporter submitted an application for a CTC of the judgment against a former staff of First Bank, Oreoluwa Adesakin, who was prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nMr Adesakin, who was accused of stealing over N40 million from the bank and its customers, was arraigned in 2014 and sentenced to seven years in prison on September 28, 2020, by O. M Olagunju.\n\nAt Justice Olagunju\u2019s court on January 13, our reporter was directed to the court\u2019s registry to make necessary payments for the CTC.\n\nAfter paying the statutory N100 for filing, a court official who PREMIUM TIMES later identified as Adewale Ipaye, requested our reporter to pay for the photocopying, even though the court has its own photocopier.\n\n\u201cEven the file, they have come for it from the appeal (court). So we have to go and retrieve it from there. Then, you drop money because we are going to do the photocopy. I don\u2019t know the number of pages. Just drop 2,000. If it is more than that, when you come (I\u2019ll tell you). I don\u2019t usually do it for people but because you said you are a journalist, that is why. If it is a lawyer, I won\u2019t do it o,\u201d he said, eventually collecting N1,500 from the reporter.\n\nHe sent the copy of the judgment in less than a week. Afterwards, the reporter paid N1,890 at the registry, being the amount charged for the certification of the 93-page document.\n\nAn official at the registry who spoke on condition of anonymity told PREMIUM TIMES that the money paid to Mr Ipaye was an extortion.\n\nBut several Ibadan-based lawyers were not surprised by the outcome of PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings.\n\n\u201cWell, by and large for Oyo State, it doesn\u2019t take time,\u201d said Hussein Afolabi, a lawyer. \u201cIf you apply for CTC and you go back to your office to go and sleep, it will take time. What we do is we apply for CT, and file\u2026. for assessment, then we follow up. I file in the registry, go to the court, to see the clerk and officials. I tell them I\u2019ve filed for CTC if I wait for the registry to contact the court. The file will move at snail\u2019s mode, we mobilise them.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018mobilisation\u2019 he was referring to is an undisclosed amount offered as a tip to facilitate a faster process.\n\n\u201cNormally, if they deliver a judgment today, one should be able to get a copy of the judgment today. But sometimes, we have issues when the judgment delivered wasn\u2019t typed,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was corroborated by another lawyer in the state, Adekunle Adewumi, who said what PREMIUM TIMES paid to Mr Ipaye is relatively low compared to what the court officers collect from some lawyers.\n\n\u201cI have had cause to pay more on some occasions. The court officials now see it as their right. Sometimes, they deliberately abandon your application, waiting for you to give them something,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oyo State Chief Judge, Abimbola Munta, has ordered that an investigation be conducted based on PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings.\n\nMr Ipaye has also been summoned after this newspaper confronted the court authorities with necessary documents and evidence obtained while processing the CTC of the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe chief judge of the high court and the entire Oyo State judiciary frowns upon extortions, bribery and corruption. They do not generalise issues and prefer to handle issues as it comes, one at a time. Oyo State judges are honest, they are judiciary heads and may not know what is going on administratively. No judge will know that the registrars and court clerks are extorting lawyers and encouraging it. It is unethical,\u201d an official of the Oyo judiciary who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorised to talk to the press, said.\n\nAccording to the source, lawyers have been encouraged to report cases of extortion instead of giving bribes.\n\n\u201cIf there are such cases, it will be looked into and the parties involved if found guilty will be dealt with,\u201d she said.\n\nSweet-bitter experience in Lagos\n\nAt the Lagos State High Court, our reporter was told he could not apply to obtain the CTC of a judgment as a concerned member of the public. Only a lawyer who is a party in the case can do so, he was told.\n\nThe official brushed aside the reporter\u2019s argument that a court judgment is a public document that should be made available to anyone who applies for it.\n\nInterviews with several lawyers, however, showed that the delay in issuance of CTCs of judgments in Lagos courts is similar to that in Kwara and Oyo states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a torture, a very tortious process here,\u201d said Monday Ubani, a Lagos-based legal practitioner. \u201cIf you look at the constitution and look at the rule, the moment a judgment is read, you are supposed to be handed a copy of that judgment or ruling. But here, most of the judges know the process we go through in order to obtain a certified copy of those judgments or rulings but they will leave us in the hands of their registrars.\n\n\u201cThey will tell you the process of getting it typed or photocopied. If you like you pay but if you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t go to the judge to tell him what happened. You can\u2019t even have access to the judge. It is a thing that I personally felt the administration of the judiciary should have addressed.\u201d\n\nMr Ubani, who spoke with PREMIUM TIMES in March, said he had applied for a copy of judgment since January but was yet to get it from a Lagos State high court.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to mention the judge, I don\u2019t want to indict any judge. If I want to apply for anything (in the appellate court) now, I need the certified true copy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even complain with the whole thing upside down because what is normal is no longer normal, what is abnormal is what has become normal in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFarouk Obisakin, a lawyer, cited an example of an instance when the CTC of a judgment was delayed for nearly three months.\n\nMr Obisakin, however, said delay depends on the judges, adding that for judges who are good at using modern communications, their copies of judgment are easier to obtain.\n\n\u201cSome of the judges, in fact, type as they speak or get someone that types like a stenographer,\u201d he said.\n\nDigitalisation will resolve the delay\n\nThe Director of Centre for Justice, Mercy and Reconciliation, an NGO based in Ibadan, Hezekiah Olujobi, said his organisation had long advocated for digitalisation of the court process.\n\n\u201cIn this age of technology, there are cases that the judges can record without even writing down anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile handwriting is a good form of documentation, there are experts who can take these documents and even upload them on the Internet\n\n\u201cIn America, there are court judgments that under 24 hours, you see them online but the reverse is the case in Nigeria. I think the judiciary is long overdue for this reform because it will reduce the stress of judges.\u201d\n\nMr Ubani called on the Chief Justice of Nigeria and chief judges of all the states in the federation to address the anomaly.\n\n\u201cThey should go ahead and put it into law that any judge that wants to read a judgment or ruling must ensure that it is ready before pronouncement. Once you are done reading it, hand a copy over to the counsel at most, one week after the judgment.\n\n\u201cIf any of the chief judges put it as a rule, I can assure you all the judges in our judiciary will comply. But because there has not been any pronouncement made by the chief judges over this issue. That is why it takes three months, five months before getting a CTC. I think the NBA should be able to push this.\u201d\n\nBut Soji Oye, the spokesperson of the National Judicial Council, said lawyers should petition any judge that delays the release of copies of court judgments.\n\n\u201cThey are supposed to follow the provisions of the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the normal thing to do. You can write a petition,\u201d Mr Oye said.\n\nRapulu Nduka, the publicity Secretary of the NBA, said although the attention of the association had not been drawn to the delays, it is ready to intervene.\n\n\u201cThe NBA has some structure, the branch level. Every state has at least a minimum of three branches and I believe that most times if there is a problem with that, practitioners within a state have a problem, they can resolve it within the state. If the NBA is called upon or there are issues brought to the attention of the NBA, then the NBA will intervene.\u201d\n\nMr Nduka, however, said the process of obtaining copies of judgment has improved when compared to previous years.\n\nThis report is funded by the Civic Media Lab, under its Criminal Justice Reporting Fellowship, with support from MacArthur Foundation",
          "summary": "But lawyers told PREMIUM TIMES that they often wait for months to obtain the copies and sometimes miss the three-month deadline to file an appeal.\n\u201cYour application was also part of the reason it came this early,\u201d Mr Gambari told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\u201cA lot of work is on our judges in and outside the court,\u201d Mr Gambari said.\nOyo State judges are honest, they are judiciary heads and may not know what is going on administratively.\nThe official brushed aside the reporter\u2019s argument that a court judgment is a public document that should be made available to anyone who applies for it.",

Ejike Mbaka, at one of the venues where his supporters were protesting his alleged disappearance.\n\nPalpable tension had heightened in different parts of Enugu State over the whereabouts of the spiritual director of Adoration Ministry.\n\nThe tension followed an alarm raised by Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide (OYC) over the whereabouts of the priest.\n\nMbaka has been in the news after he urged President Muhammadu Buhari to resign or be impeached.\n\nBut, the presidency replied swiftly and claimed that he was attacking Buhari because he was refused a contract.\n\nAnother chapter was added to the feud between the presidency and Mbaka yesterday when OYC claimed that the priest was missing.\n\nA statement issued by the president-general of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, claimed that the cleric was last seen on Tuesday, adding that every effort to trace him had failed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that his aides have neither seen nor heard from him since Tuesday.\n\n\u201cCalls put to his mobile line have also remained unanswered; this has now prompted us to issue this alarm as we would not take it lightly should anything untoward happen to him.\n\n\u201cWe are giving the Federal Government 48 hours to produce the priest, else they should be ready to face Igbo youths. They were dining and wining with him all along and now that he told the truth, they are no longer comfortable with him.\n\n\u201cLet nothing happen to Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka. It will not be in anybody\u2019s interest,\u201d the group warned.\n\nSome close aides of the Catholic Cleric who declined comment, said the picture was not clear yet.\n\nBut it was learnt from some sources who preferred anonymity that he was seen yesterday when he departed to honour an invitation by his Bishop, Callistus Onaga.\n\nFollowing the tension generated over his whereabouts, his supporters embarked on a peaceful protest, demanding his release.\n\nA message inviting the youths to the Adoration ground, read, \u201cImportant!\n\n\u201cGood morning friends and well-wishers. Please if you know you stand for justice and you do not want the lone voice that speaks for the poor in this country to be silenced, gather at Adoration ground let\u2019s go for a protest at the Bishops court.\n\n\u201cFr. Mbaka is nowhere to be found. He went yesterday to answer the Bishop\u2019s call and up till now, he\u2019s not taking his calls. Let\u2019s gather! SSG.\u201d.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Enugu State Command, Daniel Ndukwe said he was in a meeting.\n\nMeanwhile thousands of Catholic faithful embarked on peaceful protest to the residential house of the Onaga.\n\nThe protesters who carried placards with different inscriptions including No Mbaka No Bishop, insisted that they wanted to see Mbaka.\n\nSome of the protesters destroyed the fence of the house of Onaga, alleging that his house was the last place Mbaka visited before he was declared missing.\n\nTension was however doused when Mbaka suddenly appeared at one of the venues of the protest and waved at his supporters before proceeding to Adoration Ground in Emene.",

Saleh maintained that the claim was untrue.\n\nThe statement reads in parts: \u201cThe attention of the parents of the 39 abducted Afaka students has been drawn to a screaming headline in today\u2019s (May 5, 2021) publication of Roots TV to the effect that one of us (name withheld), who spoke to them in a live interview, claimed that we, the parents of the abducted students, contributed and paid the sum of N800,000 naira to a Fulani man through Sheikh Gumi for the release of our children.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state in no unclear terms that the claim has no basis in fact. Though the woman in the said video has a child in captivity, but her claim is untrue.\n\nThe woman is not a member of the committee representing the affected parents and did not speak on behalf of the parents.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, the Forum of the Abducted Parents has never gathered money and given to Gumi or to someone through the revered Islamic scholar at anytime. We therefore dissociate ourselves from the statement.\n\nThe committee considers the statement as unfortunate and an unnecessary distraction from its commitment to secure the release of their children who have now spent 56 days in captivity.\n\n\u201cFor the record, the committee representing the Forum of Parents of the 39 Abducted Students visited the home of Sheikh Gumi to seek his intervention for the release of our children, but he declined, on the grounds that as a law-abiding citizen he would not want to go against the position of the state government which has forbidden anyone to negotiate with bandits.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the esteemed Sheikh for any personal injury the statement might have caused him.\n\n\u201cAgain we call on all to join their voices in calling on government at state and federal levels to work extra hard to ensure the safe release of our children so that they may be reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cWhile we await God\u2019s intervention for the release of our children, we call on all people of goodwill to join us in prayers as we continue to seek God\u2019s help for the release of our children,\u201d it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, circumstances surrounding the release of the students remain unclear.\n\nThe students were kidnapped in March, but 11 were earlier freed.\n\nOne of the affected parents confirmed that they were released at a village in Giwa Local Government Area of the state and that they were on their way to Kaduna, as at the time of going to press.\n\nThe Kaduna Police Command has reported to the State Government, the release of the remaining students, the second security update, Wednesday revealed.\n\nAccording to a statement by internal security and Home Affairs commissioner, Mr Samuel Aruwan, the government rejoices with the freed students, their families and the management of the institution over this development.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai charged them to view their ordeal as a motivator to put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead.

This meeting, therefore, affords an opportunity to look into the provision for the armed forces.\n\n\u201cLet us take stock of the needs of the military and see if the supplementary budget might address that issue. So, it is an opportunity we can explore.\n\nMrs. Ahmed noted: \u201cBut, let me quickly say, as a matter of fact, that in 2019, 19.6billion was budgeted for capital, and 12.84billion was released which amounted to 64.37 percent.\n\nIn 2020, 34.37billion was allocated and that allocation was released 100 percent. In 2021, as at May ending, out of the 29billion budgeted, 17.98billion representing 61.92 percent disbursement and we are expecting to achieve 100 percent disbursement too, for 2021.\n\n\u201cFor overhead, in 2019, out of the budgeted amount of 15.64billion, 14.299billion was released, which represents 91.01 percent.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, overhead was 20.63billion and releases was 20.471billion, representing 99.21 percent, and for the current year 2021, in the last three months, out of the budgeted overhead of 20.63billion, the sum of 4.99billion has been released, which is 96.75 percent prorated for three months.\n\nThe Service chiefs represented by their various Heads of Accounts and Budget were present at the hearing, and all confirmed the details and the figures presented by the Honourable Minister.\n\nThe presentation and clarifications by Mrs. Ahmed were based on the news making the rounds that the military is being underfunded.\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman, senate committee on defense, Sentor Ali Ndume said \u201cIn the past couple of months, the security challenge in the country has reached an alarming level, with series of banditry and kidnappings in the northern part of Nigeria, and killing of officers and security personnel and arson in the South.\n\n\u201cThis committee, therefore, is desirous of an immediate action to stem the tide. We are worried about the news from the military that resources are not made available for them to prosecute their operations.\n\nWe are, therefore, worried that Nigeria has not been so bad; citizens and communities now do deals with bandits to safeguard their lives and communities,\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Accounts and Budget, Nigerian Army, Major General Adekunle Adigun Adesope, said that in his 30 years in the Army, 2020 was a milestone for him, because that was the first time that he saw 100 percent disbursement to the military.\n\nHe commended the support of Mr. President and the Minister in providing funding to the military.\n\nHe, however, appealed for more funding, because what is appropriated to the military, according to him, is inadequate.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has claimed President Muhammadu Buhari and his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan paid ransoms to kidnappers.\n\nObasanjo made the bombshell statement when he received members of Tiv Professionals Group (TPG) at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Wednesday.\n\nObasanjo said not just the Buhari administration but that of former President Goodluck Jonathan negotiated with kidnappers.\n\n\u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they deny it,\u201d he said.\n\nObasanjo urged the government to develop a means to deal with kidnappers and bandits, instead of pampering them with ransom payment.\n\n\u201cSome people are still reaching out, and hoping that lives can still be saved. But a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly.\n\n\u201cHe is a folly. This is because when you pay ransom, you encourage. But if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d he said.\n\nRumours of ransom payment had emerged in several negotiations between the Buhari administration and Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThere were also speculations of ransom payments in negotiations between state governments and terrorists.\n\nThe Buhari government was said to have paid ransom to secure the release of both the Chibok and the Dapchi schoolgirls.\n\nThe Chibok schoolgirls were kidnapped on 14 April 2014 during Jonathan\u2019s era.\n\nBut four years later, Buhari had his own dose of kidnapping, when the Dapchi girls were captured in February 2018 in Yobe state.\n\nLess than a month after, the girls were released, with one of them, Leah Sharibu held back.\n\nRansom was suspected, but the Buhari administration vehemently denied it.\n\nA UN report in August 2018 also disclosed \u2018large ransom payment\u2019 to ISWAP, but Information Minister denied. He said what government paid was a promise of \u2018ceasefire\u2019.\n\nWith more kidnapping targeting students in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states, President Buhari in February publicly denounced ransom.\n\nInstead, he urged states and security agencies to be more proactive in preventing abductions.\n\nHe warned state governors on the dangers of rewarding armed bandits stating that such policies can be disastrous.\n\n\u201cState Governments must review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles. Such a policy has the potential to backfire with disastrous consequences\u201d, Buhari said.\n\n\u201cStates and Local Governments must also play their part by being proactive in improving security in & around schools.\n\n\u201cLet bandits, kidnappers and terrorists not entertain any illusions that they are more powerful than the government.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t mistake our restraint for the humanitarian goals of protecting innocent lives as a weakness or a sign of fear or irresolution,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna governor Nasir El-Rufai agreed with the President as he has vowed not to pay a dime to terrorists holding people hostage.\n\nHe has advocated a policy of annihilating the terrorists, saying the only thing they deserve is death.\n\nObasanjo on Wednesday suggested a carrot and stick approach in dealing with insecurity and terrorism, although he did not elaborate.\n\nAccording to reports, Obasanjo was instrumental in the release of the 27 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State.\n\n*With reports by Daily Trust",

          "title": "Catholic Church suspends Father Mbaka amidst Buhari spar; followers on rampage",
          "text": "The Catholic Diocese of Enugu has suspended Ejike Mbaka from church activities for one month, Peoples Gazette can report, as the controversial priest\u2019s political escapades continue to overshadow his theological obligations on a scale that nurtures unending concerns amongst his senior clerics.\n\nMr Mbaka was asked to proceed on suspension with effect from May 3 after being summoned by Callistus Valentine Onaga, the diocesan bishop. Mr Onaga called Mr Mbaka in following his repeated clashes with President Muhammadu Buhari and warned that his conduct was smearing the image of the church, the largest of any Christian organisation worldwide, church officials familiar with the matter told The Gazette.\n\nMost Rev. Dr. Callistus Valentine Onaga\n\nMr Mbaka sparred with Mr Buhari\u2019s aides in a series of verbal fireworks that included the Nigerian presidency threatening to blackmail the priest as a political jobber and public contract racketeer. Mr Mbaka denied the allegations.\n\nStill, Mr Onaga and other senior reverend fathers of the Enugu Diocese were compelled to step in and mitigate the unfolding public perception tumult that could have far-reaching consequences for the conventional but unofficial church and state relationship.\n\nThe church leaders recognised that Mr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry as an independent congregation that does not fall directly under the main church\u2019s control, he could still be reined in as a priest under the Roman Catholic\u2019s certification, officials said.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Mr Mbaka returned to his ministry that lies north of the outskirts of Enugu city centre, where he subsequently incited his members against the bishop, sources said.\n\nMr Mbaka\u2019s followers claimed without evidence that he was kidnapped by Mr Onaga and handed over to the State Security Service. They subsequently marched on the premises of the bishop on Wednesday morning, looting and destroying assets therein.\n\nThe mob also descended on the Holy Ghost Cathedral, again looting and destroying items in the building. The members also went to town to allege that the SSS had arrested Mr Mbaka \u2014 generating widespread media reports despite lacking requisite corroboration. The Gazette did not publish the claim.\n\nA spokesman for the SSS denied taking Mr Mbaka into custody or coming in any contacts with him when reached by The Gazette, contrary to his followers\u2019 rumours.\n\nA spokesman for the diocese did not immediately return a request seeking comments. Mr Mbaka\u2019s line was switched off when dialled by The Gazette on Wednesday night.\n\nBefore falling out with Mr Buhari recently, Mr Mbaka was an ardent supporter of the president. He endorsed his campaign in 2015 and claimed his blessings played a role in its success.\n\nBut as Mr Buhari\u2019s regime failed to tackle acute poverty and insecurity, Mr Mbaka said he was compelled to speak up and distance himself from his regime, describing it as evil and satanic and calling on the president himself to vacate office.\n\nBuhari and Mbaka\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s controversial spokesman Garba Shehu subsequently issued a statement, claiming Mr Mbaka\u2019s comments were out of anger for his unsuccessful attempts to corner lucrative federal contracts. The priest denied the allegations but confirmed that he recommended a group of security contractors to the president whose proposals were not acted upon.\n\nChurch sources said Mr Mbaka\u2019s latest suspension was being viewed as significant for its undertone, but not the first time the fiery priest would face administrative action.\n\n\u201cWe know people will link this to his confrontation with Buhari, but he was once demoted from a parish priest to a deputy under a parish priest,\u201d a church official said. \u201cHe had also been transferred from bigger parishes to smaller ones for his frequent infractions in the past.\u201d\n\nStill, church officials admitted Mr Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry has been a cash cow for the Enugu Diocese, even though it was built by Mr Mbaka and not directly under its control.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is the Diocese has been financially dependent on Mbaka, collecting his millions,\u201d a source said, adding that some of the senior clerics themselves have also been in bed with politicians whom Mr Mbaka has long railed against.",

          "text": "Prominent Islamic scholar, Ahmad Gumi should be appreciated for his efforts in seeking the release of the kidnapped students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State.\n\nThe spokesman of the parents of the kidnapped students, Friday Sanni, said this on Wednesday in an interview with The PUNCH.\n\nHe asked Nigerians to stop vilifying the cleric and accusing him of speaking for the bandits, rather he should be commended and applauded.\n\nSanni noted that with the efforts made by Gumi in securing the release of the students, he and other parents recently spoke with their children.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Honourable Sheikh, we want to commend him. We went to him and when we got to him that day, he actually told us his challenges arising from the fact that the government officials in Kaduna State and some Nigerians are accusing him of having a connection with the bandits which has become one of the hindrances he has as to how to end the banditry.\n\n\u201cHe felt that the people that are ravaging the whole place need to be reached to with a message of Islam and he established contact with them and gave them an appointment, went to the bush with them and preached to them and then make them to understand that what they are doing is wrong which every well-meaning Nigerian should be able to commend him for that but we are not doing.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident (kidnapping) took place in some states outside Kaduna, he was able to reach the bandits, talk with them and mediate between them and the families or the state governments and they were able to sort it out.\n\n\u201cBut people are asking questions; how did he know where they are? Even you (interviewer) as you are, if you have an interest in knowing where the bandits are, you will get to know the place. Remember he made a statement that the government is asking how he knows where they are and he said even the government knows where they are.\n\n\u201cBecause this clergyman is coming out to tell Nigerians what is happening in the country, some people develop unnecessary hatred for him and that is why we are where we are because we don\u2019t want to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nSanni, however, condemned the Federal and Kaduna State Government for not having the political will to secure the release of their wards.\n\nThe parents\u2019 spokesman added that the government knows the bandits\u2019 whereabouts but lacks the willpower to go after them.\n\nHe asserted that the parents preferred to pay ransom to secure their children\u2019s release and have themselves arrested later on.\n\nSanni said the parents have been emotionally, psychologically, and mentally imprisoned since the kidnap of their children 56 days ago.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has called on the Federal Government to develop means to deal with kidnappers and bandits heavily in place of the payment of ransom.\n\nHe also stressed the need for leaders to ensure the 2023 birth emergence of a new federation in the nation, warning that the country may slide into what he described as ground dissolution.\n\nThe elder statesman made the recommendation on Wednesday when he received members of the Tiv Professionals Group (TPG) led by Professor Zacharys Gundu, at his residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\n\u201cSome people are still reaching out and hoping that lives can still be saved; but a situation whereby anybody thinks paying ransom is the way out, that person is folly. He is a folly.\n\n\u201cThis is because when you pay ransom, you encourage; but if you are not going to pay ransom, you must have the means to deal heavily with it. You must have the stick to deal with it,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe added, \u201cGovernment has always paid ransom. Not only this government, even during (Goodluck) Jonathan (administration). They paid ransom, but they denied it.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who condemned the security challenges in the country, insisted that 2023 must mark a watershed for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe year 2023 should give us the beginning of the emergence of a new federation. Feeling that the rot continues, then we are going to be sliding back to a ground dissolution. God forbid,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting It Right\n\nObasanjo decried that those beating drums of division in the country do not think about the interest of the minority ethnic groups.\n\nHe explained that the minority ethnic groups face oppression and extermination should Nigeria be allowed to break as being agitated by some people.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we will get it right in Nigeria, any leader must look at Nigeria with the prism of the diversity of Nigeria. For as long as you look at Nigeria with the prism of your ethnic group, then you are not going anywhere, either your ethnic group or religious group.\n\n\u201cBut is there hope? There is hope,\u201d the elder statesman stated.\n\nIn his remarks, Professor Gundu told informed his host that people were being maimed in their sleep and on their ancestral land, stressing the need for influential Nigerians to rise to the occasion to stem the tide of killings in the land.\n\n\u201cNigeria seems to be losing the battle against insecurity,\u201d he said while demanding full compensation for victims of killings and destruction in Tiv land.\n\nThe leader of the delegation also sought the proscription of armed Fulani groups and intensified advocacy against nomadic pastoralism.\n\n\u201cThere are different shades of instability in the country. Nigeria is truly bleeding to death. There\u2019s even a population fault line that could lead to the \u2018Lebanon Trap\u2019.\n\n\u201cAll patriots must stand together; but if others have to be enslaved before the country can survive, we will prefer, as Tiv people, to take our destiny in our hands,\u201d he said.",

In the 8th Senate, we did everything to allow for state police, it was voted out.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari is not in the National Assembly and he cannot work outside the Constitution he has sworn to defend.

Indeed, Nigerian workers are miracles strutting on two legs. It is, therefore, extremely horrendous for a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to pronounce salary slash for Nigerian workers at this time,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Labour, the call for salary slash by the Minister is tantamount to a \u201cmass suicide\u201d wish for Nigerian workers.",

The company had called the report \u201cinaccurate and misleading\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the CPSC\u2019s request that we recall the Tread+,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWe should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize\u201d.\n\nPeloton\u2019s shares fell as much as 15.8% to $81.41 on the recall, which applies to both the Tread+ and Tread treadmills. Reports of dozens of incidents involving children, and one of a child being pulled under its machines, have been a shadow over Peloton in the last few months, eating away at some of the stock\u2019s gains spurred by a surge in popularity of its exercise bikes among people staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThis recall will likely result in significant near-term one-time financial costs and operational disruption, with potential reputational damage,\u201d Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali said, adding that there may be some legal costs too. The company generates most of its revenue from exercise bikes and subscription services, and analysts estimate that only 6% of Peloton\u2019s connected fitness subscribers own a Tread+.\n\n\u201cA recall of the product at this point is the right thing to do \u2026 but, as CEO Foley indicated, the recall probably should have been done earlier,\u201d said Walter Thompson, president, American College of Sports Medicine.

          "text": "Canada\u2019s health regulator has authorized Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12 and older.\n\nDr. Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada, on Wednesday confirmed the decision for the ages to 12 to 15 and said it will help children return to a normal life. The vaccine was previously authorized for anyone 16 or older.\n\nThe announcement comes barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorized for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is also expected to authorize the vaccine for young children by next week, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year.\n\nPfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15 showing there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots.\n\nSharma said the evidence is there that the vaccine is safe and effective in that age group. It is the first vaccine approved for children in Canada.\n\nSharma said about one-fifth of all cases in Canada have occurred in children and teenagers, and having a vaccine for them is a critical part of Canada\u2019s plan.\n\nShe said while most kids don\u2019t experience serious illness from Covid-19, a vaccine also helps protect their friends and family who may be at higher risk of complications.\n\n\u201cIt will also support the return to a more normal life for our children, who have had such a hard time over the past year,\u2033 she said.\n\nKids studied had side effects similar to young adults, the company said, mainly pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s expansion of our authorization represents a significant step forward in helping the Canadian government broaden its vaccination program and begin to help protect adolescents before the start of the next school year,\u201d Fabien Paquette, vaccines lead for Pfizer Canada, said in a statement.\n\nVaccinations have ramped in Canada in months and expects to receive at least 10 million vaccines this month. More than 34% of Canadians have received at least one dose.",
