          "text": "In October 2008, a 60-year-old butcher was admitted to a rural hospital in Al-fulah, southern Sudan, with a high fever, chills and headache. In the next two days, he developed diarrhoea, began bleeding from his nose and vomiting blood. Within five days of falling ill he was dead.\n\nNo protective gloves or antiseptic products were available at the hospital, and, six days after the butcher was admitted, a male nurse who had been caring for him developed symptoms, followed by the chief male nurse.\n\nThe man\u2019s sister was also admitted with heavy vaginal bleeding, and then the midwife who examined her also became ill with high fever, vomiting of blood and bloody diarrhoea. So did two further relatives who had helped to care for the butcher; dressing him, changing his mattresses and bed sheets, nursing and sleeping beside him while he was in the hospital \u2013 along with three further hospital patients.\n\nOf these 10 people, at least six died (records were unavailable for three of the patients). Three more deaths occurred in the community. Blood serum tests revealed, at least for eight of the patients from whom blood serum was available for testing, that the culprit was Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever.\n\nInfected people can transmit it to each other through contact with blood, body fluids, improper sterilisation of medical equipment, or airborne transmission\n\nThe outbreak is just one of numerous small outbreaks of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever to have occurred in recent years. The virus that transmits it is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 Pathogen, meaning it causes frequently fatal infections in humans and there is no effective treatment for it.\n\nThe disease is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infected animals, their freshly butchered meat or by being bitten by an infected tick. The increasingly widespread geographical dispersion of these parasites is a major cause for concern.\n\nWhere is it circulating?\n\nCrimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever is found in Eastern Europe \u2013 particularly former Soviet bloc countries \u2013 as well as throughout the Mediterranean, in north-western China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nPandemic threat\n\nThe wide geographic spread of the hard-bodied Hyalomma Marginatum ticks that carry Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus, and its persistent circulation, means the risk of spillover from animals to humans is high.\n\nFactors such as climate change and the movement of livestock or wild animals may further increase its geographic spread, with the virus recently expanding its reach from the Balkan region to Central and Western Europe.\n\nThe high death rate and absence of effective drugs or vaccines are further cause for concern. For these reasons, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever is listed on the WHO\u2019s priority list for Research and Development and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases priority A list, as a disease posing the highest level of risk to national security and public health.\n\nThe virus is transmitted to people by tick bites or through contact with blood or tissues of infected animals during and immediately after slaughter\n\nThe virus is recognised as a possible bioterrorism agent, and was studied as a potential biological weapon in Iraq. However, human-to-human transmission is currently limited, so although there is a high risk of local outbreaks, the risk of a global Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever pandemic is relatively low.\n\nHow is it spread?\n\nThe virus is transmitted to people by tick bites (particularly Hyalomma ticks, although other types of ticks can also be infected) or through contact with the blood or tissues of infected animals during and immediately after slaughter.\n\nNumerous wild and domestic animals can carry the virus, including cattle, goats, sheep, hares and ostriches. Most human cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural or slaughterhouse workers and vets. However, once infected, people can transmit it to each other through contact with blood or body fluids, or improper sterilisation of medical equipment. There are also concerns that airborne transmission may occur in some cases.\n\nNumerous wild and domestic animals can carry the virus, including cattle, goats, sheep, hares and ostriches\n\nCase fatality rate: 10-40%\n\nIncubation period: Symptoms usually develop five to six days after contact with infected blood or tissue, up to a maximum of 13 days.\n\nSymptoms: These are usually sudden in onset and include headache, high fever, vomiting and back, joint or stomach pain. As the illness progresses, people tend to develop large areas of severe bruising, heavy nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites.\n\nDiagnosis: Various laboratory tests can be used to diagnose Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, but a combination of viral antigen detection, viral RNA sequencing (reverse transcriptase-PCR), and virus isolation from patients\u2019 blood or tissues is most effective during the early days of infection. Antibodies to the virus can be detected later on, or in the blood of survivors.\n\nAre there vaccines or treatments, or ongoing research?\n\nTreatment is mostly supportive, focusing on replacing lost blood, and ensuring the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes in it, as well as supporting breathing and heart function and treating any secondary infections, while the patient recovers.\n\nSome studies suggest that the antiviral drug ribavirin may be an effective treatment, but the evidence for this is mixed.\n\nSymptoms include headache, high fever, vomiting, back, joint or stomach pain, large areas of the body with severe bruising, heavy nosebleeds, uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites\u2026\n\nNo licensed vaccine\n\nThere is currently no licensed vaccine for Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, apart from in Bulgaria, where an inactivated, mouse-brain derived vaccine has been given to military personnel since the 1970s. No efficacy studies have been published, however. Other vaccines are in development, including human and animal vaccines.\n\nLower your risk of infection\n\nPrevention of tick bites and contact with animal blood and body fluids are the main ways of preventing human cases, and therefore the chances of the virus evolving to transmit more readily between humans.\n\nEducating health workers about the symptoms, and need for proper infection control precautions in people who develop them, is also necessary to reduce human-to-human transmission.\n\nSource",

In the day time, they go out to hustle and retire to places like Oshodi market, Ladipo market, Aswani, Agege market, Ojuelegba, Ijora Olopa, Ijora Badia, Ojota , among other at areas. They are also seen at railway lines, under bridges and on kerbs, at night .\n\nInvestigation has revealed that most of them are responsible for robbery attacks around the areas they pass the night, . They are also responsible for the attacks on workers and traders who leave their houses between 4.30 am and 5am, for their respective work and business places.\n\nTheir targets are also stranded commuters at bus-stops at night, as well as motorists who are unfortunate to have their vehicles break down at night.\n\nArrest\n\nLast week, the Lagos State Police Command arrested two different groups of these youths.\n\nSeven members of the first group had assisted owner of a 2016 Model Sienna to push his vehicle which was involved in a minor accident to somewhere considered safe near Charity bus- Stop, Oshodi, with a promise to come pick it the next day.\n\nOut of trust , the motorist dropped keys of the Sienna to one of the boys , Chibuike Ekwe.\n\nHowever at midnight, Ekwe, and two others , drove the car to Coconut, in Apapa area of the state , where it was being dismantled with the intention of selling it in parts, when luck ran against them.\n\nEkwe, in the interview, said he had never stolen all his life. He blamed his indulgence in his inability to resist the temptation , after the idea was sold to him by one of the boys.\n\nAccording to him , \u201c After pushing the vehicle to a safe place, some of the boys said if they were the ones with the keys , they would move it immediately to the East , and sell it, since the owner did not know me..\n\n\u201c By 3am, I informed Dalinton Ohia and one other boy to accompany me to where the vehicle was parked and I drove it to Coconut, where one man named Container, dismantled it. He said it was easier to sell it in parts.\n\nWhile he was on it , some members of OPC accosted us and asked who owner of the car was. When we could not provide a convincing answer, Mr Container escaped, leaving me behind\u201d.\n\nAsked where he lived and did for a living, he responded, \u201c I am a panel beater at Ladipo market. I hustle in the morning and sleep in the market at night, with other boys. I have never stolen before, this is my first time\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Darlington Ohia said, \u201c My role was to accompany him(Ekwe) to where the vehicle was parked. He did not tell me he was going to butcher it. He only said he was going to re park it at Toyota. When we got there the guard ( Danladi) refused him from carrying the vehicle. While Danladi was discussing with me, Ekwe drove the vehicle away. We went to Toyota where he claimed he was going to park it in a well lit place , but didn\u2019t see him\u201d.\n\n.For Yemi Joseph, Chinoso Isiguzo and Innocent Ikeaguru and Dalandi, they claimed to have only assisted owner of the vehicle to push it to a safe place till the next day when he (owner ) promised to pay them for their service, only to be arrested .\n\nUnfortunate for those who claimed to be innocent , no relative had come to effect their bail, as requested by the Police , since their arrest.\n\nInvasion\n\nFor the second group of four boys , they attacked a driver whose vehicle broke down at Toyota bus-stops , too, last weekend. The vehicle conveying refrigerators and other electronics gadgets was vandalized and the goods carted away.\n\nThe suspects are: Somto Chukwu, 22; Chibogu Nweke, 29; Ezekiel Egbe, 29 and Chikodi John, 24.\n\nEzikiel who claims to be a vulcanizer at Ladipo market, Mushin, explained his role. He said , \u201c I had closed for the day and was going to watch foot ball match , when I saw two boys with refrigerators. They were taking them towards the canal. A friend who was with me, Sunday, said we should follow them so as to collect our share from the sale of the item, but I refused.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201c I went straight to the expressway where the boys said the vehicle conveying the goods broke down. I saw a big size refrigerator by the pavement of where the truck broke down. I took the refrigerator to Oshodi, where I used to sleep . Unfortunately for me, the person who saw when I was carrying it brought policemen to the shop at Oshodi where I sleep.\n\n\u201c We pay N100 to sleep there at night. We sleep at the veranda of shops at Oshodi. Some people sleep inside the shops but their fee is higher. I only go to Ladipo to sleep if i don\u2019t have N100 to pay for the night.\n\nI just came to Lagos from Anambra . My parents are dead and I am an only son\u201d, he said in an emotional laden tone.\n\nCry for help\n\nHis partner in crime, Nweke, said, \u201c That night, driver of the truck ran to me to help him beg some boys that invaded his truck. He said they demanded for money from him but that he had only N1000 on him. He said the boys attacked him when he told them he had no money , collected his phone from him and that he had to run for his life.\n\n\u201c I went to meet the boys and they told me since the man was not ready to give them money, they would collect the goods. Some of them carried car battery, while others carried brand new Samsung refrigerators . Those I saw with batteries were Chikodi and Ebere.\n\n\u201cI followed them to the canal by the market where they met one aboki who told them to wait till morning before he would buy the goods. But they insisted they wanted to sell them then. At the end, aboki bought the two brand new refrigerators for N30,000. They sold the battery for N6000 and I was given N5,000.\n\nFor Chikodi John, he said he got N4000 from the sales of the stolen items.\n\nOn his part, Somto, claimed to be innocent. He said \u201c I am just suffering for what I know nothing about . I was arrested because I sleep in the same place ( Ladipo market ) with them. I was sleeping when the policemen stormed the place and picked me . We sleep inside an empty container in the market\u201d he said.\n\nLike others who claimed innocence, none had come to secure his bail from Police custody since his arrest.\n\nThe suspects who were among those paraded by the Commissioner of Police, CO Hakeem Odumosu, would be charged to court soon, according to him.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Vincent Ujumadu, Awka\n\nAFTER about 20 years of the end of the communal war between Aguleri and Umueri in Anambra East Local Government area of Anambra State, which claimed many lives and led to the destruction of property worth millions of naira, tension has heightened in the area again following the recent alleged abduction of two persons at Ugume village of Umueri.\n\nA statement by a group which calls itself the \u2018Concerned Citizens of Umueri\u2019 gave names of the abducted persons as Oforma Nnalue from Irueke Adegbe and Chukwuemeka Nwakalor from Iruozobia Umueri and urged their neighbouring Aguleri people to release the two persons dead or alive.\n\nAccording to the group, several appeals made through some Aguleri leaders and some good-spirited sons of the community for the release of the abducted persons had fallen on deaf ear, warning that the latest incident might stir another hostility in the area.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cWhile Umueri awaits for the official response from Aguleri\u2014positively or negatively \u2014the news making the rounds from Aguleri seems provocative and negating our efforts to calm down our youths. There is threat and the rumour of impending war and name calling of our illustrious son, who incidentally is related paternally and maternally with the two missing persons.\n\n\u201cLet it be on record that Umueri has no plans or agenda to wage war against Aguleri or any other community for that matter. All the threats of war are the imagination of those whose breads are buttered through the crisis.\n\n\u201cWe enjoin Igbo people all over the world, the leader of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Southeast governors forum, respected clergymen, well-meaning Nigerians and those in the private sector to help us drive our demands to ensure continuous peaceful coexistence between our two communities.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we demand immediate release of our abducted brothers, dead or alive. If they are no longer living, effort should be made to toe the traditional line to atone for those murdered in cold blood, so that the issues could be resolved once and for all\u201d.\n\nWhile commending Governor Willie Obiano for ensuring that one of their daughters, who was also allegedly abducted at Isiokwe, Aguleri had since reunited safely with her family after two days of traumatic experience, they appealed to the governor to also ensure that justice was done in the matter by instructing security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of the act and punish them accordingly.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Mr. Ikenga Tochukwu said he was not aware of the abduction, even as he promised to investigate the allegation.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Stakeholders in Abia State have decried the reported abduction of students of Abia State University (ABSU) Uturu in Isuikwuato Local Government Area on Wednesday night by unknown gunmen.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that the students were kidnapped while transiting on a bus on Okigwe-Uturu Road.\n\nReacting to the ugly incident, a renowned economist, Dr. Alex Otti called on relevant authorities and security agencies to swiftly swing into action and ensure timely rescue of the students without harm, and promised to offer the necessary support and assistance that could fasten the release of the students.\n\nOtti viewed such acts of violence against the students as wicked, barbaric and reprehensible, and reminded the perpetrators of the dastardly act that nothing justifies any form of violence against innocent members of the society, much more students on legitimate academic pursuit.\n\nThe former Gubernatorial Candidate from Abia state in a release made available to newsmen in Umuahia by his Special Adviser on Media, Ferdinand Ekeoma called on governments at all levels to treat the present security challenges bedevilling the country as a pressing emergency and consider coming up with far reaching measures and strategies aimed at finding a permanent solution to the present challenges.\n\nThe ex-Bank Chief appealed to the government to engage the youths in a sincere and comprehensive dialogue that could help reduce the present tension and security challenges.\n\nAlso reacting to the abduction of the university students, the Abia State chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC), condemned the act and asked the security agencies to redouble effort and rescue the innocent students.\n\nAPC described the incident as evil, terrible and unacceptable.\n\nBenedict Godson, the Publicity Secretary of the APC in Abia State, Comrade Benedict Godson in a statement on Friday, tasked security agencies in the state to step up manhunt of the perpetrators to ensure the rescue of the abducted ABSU students.\n\nThe Party Leadership said, \u201cthe main duty now as a matter of urgency is to help the security agents with relevant information that can help secure our state because Abia belongs to all of us.\n\n\u201cThis is no time to blame anybody. This is a time for us to reason together because it is only by reasoning together that we can conquer such unspeakable acts.\n\n\u201cThe kidnapped ones are students, they\u2019re only studying for better tomorrow and do not deserve such evil. There\u2019s absolutely no justification for this on the part of the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we must realize that security is a serious business and we have to start seeing it so. We don\u2019t have any other state to call ours except Abia, so we must not sit and watch Abia turned into something else.\n\n\u201cAll over the world, security is no more the business of the government only. It\u2019s our business because a secured environment is the only environment that will thrive in business and other necessary activities.\n\n\u201cFor the parents of our kidnapped students, we urge them to calm down and we pray together with them that their children will surely be rescued in full health\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu described the scenario as unacceptable and tasked security agencies to work in synergy in exposing the perpetrators of the evil acts in the society.\n\nThe former Abia Governor lauded the prompt response of the Governors of Abia and Imo states in working closely with other stakeholders in a bid to ensure the safe release of the abducted students.\n\nKalu appealed to their parents, as well as the ABSU community to be calm and optimistic, emphasizing that the fight against kidnapping and other vices remained a collective responsibility of all levels of government regardless of political affiliation.\n\n\u201cThe students are our children and future leaders of tomorrow and as such they don\u2019t deserve to go through this emotional trauma.\n\n\u201cI am not only touched but extremely disturbed by this sad and ugly development. Moving forward all hands must be on deck to secure the release of the abducted students unharmed.\n\n\u201cOn my path I have established contacts with the relevant security agencies to ensure the safety return of these students as well as putting in place proactive measures,\u201d he said.\n\nExpressing worries on the worsening insecurity in the entire southeast zone, a Security expert, Emmanuel Nsofor said concerted effort should be taken to ensure the release of the kidnapped students.\n\nNsofor canvassed adequate funding of the Nigeria security archecture to enable them nip in the bud the upsurge of kidnapping, banditry and terrorism threatening the peaceful co-existence of the country.\n\nHe tasked security agencies to further step up strategies particularly in the area of intelligence gathering to tackle any act of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, at the time of this report, the abductors are yet to contact the ABSU authority or parents of the victims under their custody.\n\nAddressing journalists in a press conference held in Umuahia, on Friday, the Vice Chancellor of the Abia State University, Uturu, Professor O. M Ogbulu confirmed the abduction of the students by the gunmen.\n\nThe Vice Chancellor also confirmed that two of the students escaped from the hoodlums, while one student was still being held by them.\n\nProfessor Ogbulu assured that the school authority is working assiduously with security agencies to ensure the release of the students and prosecution of the culprits.\n\nHe said, \u201cTwo of the students managed to escape from the hoodlums while one other student is still being held at a yet to be identified location. Management of the University through our security outfit is working assiduously in assisting both Imo and Abia State Governments and Law enforcement agencies to rescue the victim. Steps are also being taken to avert any further occurrence of this ugly incident in the university\u201d.\n\nContinuing, the ABSU Vice Chancellor said, \u201cmembers of the public and Abia State University community should remain calm as we will spare no effort in ensuring the safety of the victim and our dear students.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that Abia State University is safe, as staff and students are going about their normal academic activities\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Abia State Government says it is working with the government of Imo State and relevant security agencies in both states to ensure the rescue of the abducted students and others.\n\nIn a release issued by the State Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu on Thursday, the Government reiterated that no criminal operating within its environment will be allowed to escape justice, as it takes the job of protecting the lives and property of Abians and visitors to the State seriously.\n\nThe press release partly stated, \u201cAbia State Government is currently monitoring an incident that happened in Okigwe, Imo State, yesterday which led to the suspected abduction of yet to be determined number of students of the Abia State University, Uturu (ABSU), who apparently ran into a yet to be identified gang of hoodlums operating along the Okigwe-Uturu Road.\n\n\u201cPreliminary information available to us indicates that the students were moving in a mini van from Okigwe to Uturu between 7pm \u2013 8pm when they ran into the armed gang who marched them into the nearby forest along with other yet to be identified travelers. Two of the students managed to escape from the hoodlums while others are still being held at a yet to be identified location.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public and ABSU community are advised to remain calm as we will spare no resource in ensuring the safety of the victims\u201d.\n\nAs part of measures to arrest the situation, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has directed for security reinforcement along the Abia segment of the Okigwe-Uturu Road to prevent future occurrence.\n\nThe Governor stated that he was directly coordinating efforts to ensure safe return of the students and the others as quickly as possible.\n\nAccording to a statement on Friday, \u201cLaw enforcement agencies of both Abia and Imo States have been mobilized to rescue the student and all those still in custody of the kidnappers\u201d.",

          "title": "Afaka students: Nigerians hit el-Rufai hard over bombardment comment, say he\u2019s insensitive",
          "text": "Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai has come under fire for his revelation that he was ready to sacrifice some students of the College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka in Igabi Local Government Area of the state in order to neutralise bandits who abducted them.\n\nFor many Nigerians, el-rufai\u2019s revelation was not just insensitive, lacking in good tactics but also a practical demonstration of how lowly Nigerian leaders think of citizens if he could merely see the killing of some students during an attack on the bandits as collateral damage.\n\nThe Kaduna State Governor courted trouble when he revealed during a webinar on Thursday that the military was ready to move against the bandits holding the students, who were eventually released after 56 days in captivity.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo days after the abduction of the Afaka young people, I was assured by the air force and the army that they knew where the kidnappers were with the students and they had encircled them.\n\n\u201cWe were going to attack them. We would lose a few students but we would kill all the bandits and we would recover some of the students. That was our plan. That was the plan of the air force and the army. But they slipped through the cordon of the army. That is why they were not attacked.\n\n\u201cWe know it is risky; we know in the process, we may lose some of the abductees but it is a price we have to pay. This is war, there will always be collateral damage in war and we will rather do that than pay money because paying money has not solved the problem anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nFor many Nigerians, including parents of the students, the plan by the governor and the military was not only cruel and evil, but against all known modern tactics of combating a crime such as abduction, where the safety of hostages are prioritised and seen as the overriding objective of such operations.\n\nThey are livid also that even if such a plan was ever contemplated, el-Rufai was not expected to divulge it, calling into question his ability to hold sensitive operational information that concerns the military or any other intelligence and security agencies.\n\nReacting to the revelation by Governor el-Rufai, one of the parents of the abducted students, who chose to remain anonymous, thanked God for making the planned bombardment fail. According to him, things are just beginning to make sense to him and other parents, in view of the recalcitrant attitude of the governor while the students remained in captivity.\n\n\u201cFirst, I must thank God for allowing our children to be re-united with us safely. It was the most harrowing 56 days of my life so far and I don\u2019t pray to ever witness such again in my life. We went through hell waiting for them to return. But then, they are back with us and while we were still jubilating and literally on top of the moon, Governor el-Rufai told the world that he would have actually killed our children just to get to the bandits. That, for me, was an insensitive thing to say, not to talk of planning to do.\n\n\u201cIt was after he made that statement that it dawned on us the reason for the way he behaved throughout the period they were in captivity. The state government treated us in less signifying ways and could not be bothered by our plight, despite saying the contrary to the world. It is now we fully understand the real danger our children faced, not just from the bandits but from el-Rufai and the military. For me, their coming back home is a miracle; but I will not forget the role played by the state government in refusing every entreaty in rescuing our children\u201d, the parent said.\n\nAn Ibadan based activist, Segun Oriowo, in a chat with DAILY POST questioned the rational behind a planned murder of innocent students, who the military and the state government should have made their priority and ensure they are reunited with their parents unhurt. According to him, the revelation by el-Rufai is a reflection of the quality of leadership in the country, and the value leaders place on the lives of citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen we say the major problem of this country is leadership, many people, especially those in government think we just love to condemn them and raise unnecessary issues but with the revelation from Governor el-Rufai, it has become obvious that we don\u2019t have leaders in this country. What we have are rulers, people who see citizens as their conquered subjects and the country as their conquered territory. If not, how can a governor be bold and comfortable enough to tell parents that he had planned to kill their children just to get at a band of criminals, who does not value his own life not to talk of the lives of his captives? For me, what el-Rufai said and how he said it, was the lowest any leader can go. Devoid of empathy, lacking in tact and highly condescending.\n\n\u201cThe governor has also shown that he is not capable of being in possession of sensitive military and intelligence information, as he tends to talk beyond what\u2019s expected of his office and divulge far too much in the process. Such a person definitely cannot be privy to sensitive information. It will be a disaster to allow such\u201d, Oriowo said.\n\nAlso reacting in a chat with DAILY POST, a community leader in the Oluwakemi, a border town between Lagos and Ogun State, Chief Asiwaju Akerele, believes Governor el-Rufai\u2019s comment was grossly insensitive and capable of causing undue apprehension for other parents whose children are still captivity, especially the students of Greenfield University.\n\n\u201cel-Rufai is actually one of the governors I respect but I am at a loss that he actually said this. It is highly insensitive and uncalled for. What ideas does he want the parents of the abducted students of Greenfield University to begin to have? That their children may become collateral damages in his obsession to wipe out the bandits? I can only imagine what is going through the minds of these parents now.\n\n\u201cI believe Governor el-Rufai should rather look for ways of calming the parents of these students, assuring them of government\u2019s commitment to rescuing the students, instead of putting them in apprehension that the students may actually be killed by forces and not by the bandits\u201d, Akerele said.\n\nFor Nigerians on social media, it was another opportunity to vent their anger. While many on Twitter blamed the governor for divulging such sensitive operational information, others outrightly took him to the cleaners.\n\nHere are the reactions:\n\n@Miashiru, believes el-Rufai was just being honest, albeit brutally. He said: \u201cGovernor El- Rufai was brutally honest. But some things are not for public consumption. We just have to find a more effective way of dealing with this enigma, but paying ransom is certainly not the way to go\u201d, while @Vandecech went for the governor\u2019s jugular as he wrote: \u201cNah your pikin them go kill as collateral damage. Efforts ought to be made to avoid hostage deaths, you don\u2019t have to gloat about the likelihood of deaths. Highly insensitive to their family members. Heartless man. Better just forget any presidential ambitions.\u201d\n\nFor @bentigor, el-Rufai was tactically wrong, submitting that such information shouldn\u2019t have left the room where it was discussed. He wrote: \u201cIt is known that some people will be caught in crossfire during such attacks but it is ill-advised to admit such to the media. I understand that he is trying to be brutally honest but certain things like that aren\u2019t supposed to leave the room they had such a discussion.\u201d @nnaemy was however more direct in his own reaction. \u201cThis is a completely foolish thing to say. The plan was to attack and kill some students but the bandits escaped the CORDON of the army. Foolish statement from a supposedly intelligent man. No wonder his sons talk from their assess\u201d, he said.\n\n@omoba_ade19 however tried to compare how hostage situations are dealt in the western world, concluding that secrecy of such a plan is key. He wrote: \u201cThis statement is not good, a significant difference between the western world and our world. US/UK/FRC/RUS govt will never say this openly even if they know it will come to the killing of a few ones. Our government has no sympathy for our lives, no form of regret for lost lives. #shame\u201d\n\n@kaffytita questioned the governor, asking if his children were part of the abducted students, would he be comfortable to say that. \u201cVery easy to say. \u2018Lose some students\u2019. Those are real people, if it were your children, would you say \u2018lose some children\u2019? People\u2019s children fa, abeggi\u201d, while @oluwadamilola_k wondered if Governor el-Rufai knows the implication of his statement. He said: \u201cThis man doesn\u2019t know the implication of what he\u2019s saying. I hope the heartless kidnappers won\u2019t launch another attack soon in Kaduna to dare him. Buhari is pleading with them and El-Rufai is here making empty threats.\u201d\n\nFor @ikimij, he believes the government should rather consider the lives of hostages before thinking of bandits to be killed. He wrote: \u201cA sane government will consider the life they\u2019re trying to save before thinking of getting rid of the bandits. The purpose of the military should be to save life rather looking for children to sacrifice\u201d, while @basho07 have this to say: \u201cMr Gov must have been quoted out of context or something went wrong somewhere.(Slip of tongue) This statement is definitely a misguided one and will in years to come be your nemesis.\u201d",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government on Friday said it had concluded the processes to commence the prosecution of some Nigerians, including highly placed individuals, for terrorism financing.\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who disclosed this to journalists in the State House, said government had carried out extensive investigation on allegations of terrorism financing against some Nigerians, adding that substantial grounds had already been established against those accused.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria commenced investigating and processing those suspected to be financiers of terror in the country after the conviction of some persons in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), adding that Nigeria had done a more elaborate investigation and had established the connection of many Nigerians to terror financing in the country.\n\n\u201cAs you will actually know, sometimes back, there were certain convictions of Nigerians allegedly involved in terrorism financing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). That gave rise to wider and far-reaching investigations in Nigeria, and I\u2019m happy to report that arriving from the wider coverage investigation that has been conducted in Nigeria, a number of people, both institutional and otherwise, were found to be culpable.\n\nRead Also; The Sheikh Gumi terrorism paradox\n\n\u201cI mean reasonable grounds for suspicion of terrorism financing have been established or perhaps has been proven to be in existence in respect of the transactions of certain high-profile individuals and businessmen across the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to report that investigation has been ongoing for long and it has reached an advanced stage.\n\n\u201cArriving from the investigation, there exists, certainly, reasonable grounds for suspicion that a lot of Nigerians, high-profile, institutional and otherwise, are involved in terrorism financing and they are being profiled for prosecution.\n\n\u201cIn essence, it is indeed true that the government is prosecuting and it\u2019s indeed initiating processes of prosecuting those high-profile individuals that are found to be financing terrorism. It is indeed true.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister was however reluctant to give the number of such suspects as he maintained that investigation was still ongoing.\n\nHe further said: \u201cAs to the number, investigation is ongoing and it has to be conclusive before one can arrive at a certain number. But one thing I can tell you is it is a large number and they are being profiled for prosecution.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a large number and I\u2019m not in a position to give you the precise number as at now, because the profiling and investigation are ongoing.\u201d\n\nMalami warned of the resolve of government to invoke the full wrath of the law on anyone that may be sponsoring terrorism in the country.\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: nobody is going to be spared, no stone will be left unturned.

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has lamented what he described as the \u2018mercilessness of some Nigerians\u2019 to the course and development of the country, pleading with citizens to be considerate towards the country.\n\nPresident Buhari spoke on Friday after receiving briefings from the Prof. Doyin Salami-led Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) at its 6th regular meeting held in the State House, Abuja.\n\nHe decried the situation in which some unscrupulous people tried to undermine every policy of government, irrespective of the good it was meant to achieve for the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, President Buhari recalled that despite efforts to regulate importation and proliferation of some commodities in the country by shutting land borders for more than a year, some Nigerians still found ways to circumvent the barriers to perpetuate smuggling of illicit commodities.\n\n\u201cSome people are mercilessly against this country,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe closed the borders to control the smuggling of petroleum products and check the influx of smuggled goods, arms and ammunition. That was when the Comptroller General of Customs called me, saying 40 tankers laden with petrol had been impounded. I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles. I said shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped. People must show consideration for their own country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also pledged that the federal government would focus on greater development of irrigation facilities in the country and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nPresident Buhari said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome the economic challenges confronting it, stressing: \u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources: gas, vast arable land which we are not using enough.\u201d\n\nThe President was responding to disclosure by Prof Salami, in his presentation, that only 2% of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives are needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nOn the security challenges, which PEAC said was having great repercussions on the economy, President Buhari charged leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noting that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nPEAC submitted that the global economy has continued to improve as COVID-19 infections drop and roll-out of vaccination intensifies, adding that the Nigerian economy, though out of recession, remains fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as a basis for revitalising the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation and incentives for private investment in irrigation to promote all-year-round farming.",

          "text": "\u2022Reveals the secrets of her good health at 94\n\n\u2022Why I\u2019ve retained northerners as guards for 40 years\n\nFormer President of the International Women Society (IWS), Chief Olufunke Arthur-Worrey, is the younger sister of the late nationalist lawyer, journalist, trade unionist and politician, Chief H. O. Davies. The 94-year-old mother of a former Lagos State Commissioner for Land, Fola Arthur-Worrey, and holder of high traditional titles from prominent Lagos, Delta and Osun communities spoke with GBENGA ADERANTI about her private life and the state of the nation, among other issues.\n\nAt 94, you still come across as a fit and witty individual. What is the secret?\n\nIf you believe in one God, everything is possible. One of the things I can say about my life at the moment is that God is there for me. He has been looking after me and He has done wonders in my life. I am very lucky my health has been wonderful. I still engage in activities and my faculty is intact. I can see, I eat what I want and I go out voluntarily. I have people around me. My family members are there. Most of my childhood friends have gone to rest but I still have Nigerians looking after me. What else do I need?\n\nI still belong to a society like the International Women Society. The members of IWS are like my sisters and children. We all still gather. They still ask for my advice and I advise them in whatever way I can.\n\nI am satisfied and I thank God that I have the facility to enjoy what God has done in my life.\n\nGod has done so many things for me. I\u2019ve seen so many things that cause me to thank God.\n\nYou just spoke about your faculty remaining intact. Can you explain that?\n\nFor instance, I still remember where I keep my things whenever I\u2019m looking for them. You know I am 94. I still remember all the files. If I want something or if my son comes and says, \u2018What about the passport of my father?\u2019 or anything like that, I know where exactly it is. And if I keep something like money in a place, I remember where I kept it anytime I want it. When you came in, we talked about politics. That is faculty. Thank God, I can sing. I can pray on my own. I dance and I tell children stories, and I ask them to tell me stories. That is my faculty, and I thank God it is correct. What else do I need? I can walk, I can jump. But at times, something pulls me back and tells me that you are no longer young again.\n\nMany people of your age are battling one ailment or the other. Does that apply to you?\n\nGod has been wonderful to me health wise. Apart from when I was having my children in England, I hardly go to the hospital. Even some of the time I went to the hospital, it was because I was forced by my son and the family. They would say, \u2018Mummy, you have to see a doctor.\u2019 Left to me, I don\u2019t think I have to see a doctor. But they always insist, so I go. The only drug I use regularly is the one prescribed for me to normalise my blood pressure. A family doctor gave me the medicine in England. He said \u2018regularly, for the rest of your life, you have to take it.\u2019 I\u2019ve been taking it. Sometimes, the doctors change it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut I like eating organic food. We have so many in our markets, especially vegetables and onions. There are some onions in our markets that are better than the ones you get from anywhere. I go for that. I go for okro and I love our native foods like amala and eba. Health wise, you can see me. I thank God. I\u2019m not boasting; I\u2019m just saying the fact so that you will thank God for me.\n\nI sleep well. I don\u2019t believe in dreams. If I lie down here, I will sleep, especially when I\u2019m watching the television. I just feel comfortable. I\u2019m not rich as such, but I\u2019m comfortable. I thank God for what he has done for me.\n\nYou grew up as a Lagos girl. How was Lagos then?\n\nThe Lagos of those days was like a family. We were so happy together and movement then was easy. You didn\u2019t have to rack your brain before going out. For instance, on the spur of the moment, you could say let\u2019s go to Epe and buy fish or go to Ota and buy vegetables and smoked fish just for a change. Of course, going to Ota then was like going to London. Then, we were so comfortable. The Bar Beach was there for us, unlike now when they have built the Eko Atlantic. We used to go to Eleko. All these little hamlets and beaches, we used to enjoy them. Lagos was fantastic. We didn\u2019t have to bother about anything. We were close. Like my family from Isale Eko, I\u2019m connected with Isale-Eko, Tokunbo, Sango and Ita-Faji. We were so connected. I enjoyed my life. My youth was beautiful, lovely and fantastic.\n\nYou are current not only about what is going on in the country but also around the world. Does that mean you still read?\n\nI still read novels (points to her collection of books on her bookshelf.)\n\nHow long does it take you to read a novel?\n\nIt depends on its volume. I like poems. I like history. I love history. I love to read about what happened in England and their lives; how they got married, how they started their fight over nothing. Then the current world affairs, how they are all jealous of each other, like Russia and these little countries, the way they go about fighting each other. I like reading about this young North Korea leader; the one that is throwing bombs. And you go to the Middle East, there were some small countries we used to visit, like Lebanon, Syria, Libya. You remember when Ghadafi was their head of state. Nigerians used to go to Tripoli to trade.\n\nAnother thing I do now is to travel throughout the world by looking at the world map, the atlas. Now I know Nigeria more by knowing all the nooks and crannies, how we are connected and all that; and to our neighbours in Chad and Niger. The world is wonderful. I read a lot. It is part of me, I must read. I read magazines. I love to read about people. I\u2019m still learning every day to know more about Europe, about the world and the connections. Recently, I asked myself, our children who are going to Tripoli, how do they do it? Then I started looking at the connection with Africa, all the way from Nigeria to Tripoli, and I said it is a lot of wahala (trouble). I looked at Egypt and I saw the Suez Canal where there was a blockade recently. I learn so much. That is my life.\n\nI still go to my IWS meeting. I am a member of their (board of) trustees. I still go to Abeokuta, my mother\u2019s family, in Decembers for family harvest.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 must have affected your movement. How have you been managing?\n\nYes. I hate covering my nose, but these airlines, 100 of them lying down, they can\u2019t fly. All the shops are empty. What is happening in India is alarming. The way they were burning dead people openly really upset me. They are still talking about the second wave and third wave. It is only God that can stop this. This thing came surprisingly. I have been vaccinated. They said we should come back in June to take the next one. What I\u2019m saying is that we are lucky; we got the first one by the grace of God. They said we can\u2019t take half and leave half. They said 75 per cent of the population of Nigeria has taken. What about the rest 25 per cent? What about the beggars on the street? What about the prisoners? What about the aged? What about the villagers, how do you get them? I don\u2019t know. It is only God that can heal the world. I think with the 75 per cent, they have tried. We heard that they would bring more vaccines. I wish Nigeria best of luck.\n\nWhen it first came, I remember, they said people would be dying on the streets of Africa. We thank God today and I hope it will get better. There was a report that for two days, nobody died in Lagos. But in our markets, nobody covers their noses. We are in the hands of God. I think God loves Nigeria.\n\nSome of your guards are still with you. Considering the level of insecurity in Nigeria, one would think you would have replaced them. Why did you choose to retain them?\n\nTwo of them came with me from Ikoyi, Liverton Road. That was in 1967, during the Biafran war when we all left the government. First of all, we went to live at Agege, though we got an offer in Apapa. We had this farmland at Agege where we used to go and spend weekends if we did not travel. We would take friends there. It was like a farmhouse. We would do barbecue, children used to go there and enjoy themselves. My husband decided that instead of paying so much for Apapa, why couldn\u2019t we go to our farm? We had already built two rooms like a shed. We went there from Ikoyi. People were saying, \u2018From Ikoyi to Agege? What is in Agege?\u2019 But we enjoyed it. We had the opportunity to buy everything and we enjoyed the neighbourhood.\n\nThe two (guards), Yaya and Yellow, followed us from Obalende in Ikoyi. They were from Borno. They helped us to put the bungalow there. From there, Yaya left. Yellow too later left. They would not say they were leaving; they would say they were going home. But before they leave, they would bring another person. It has been like that. These people have never bothered me. For security, night and day, they are here. I\u2019ve been lucky with them. I\u2019ve kept them since 1967. They are part of my family. That Baba you see out there has been with me for over 40 years the other one has been with me for 17 years. I\u2019m afraid that if something has to happen and they have to leave, I don\u2019t know what I will do.\n\nThe only thing is that we want our government to do the right thing. Our government should make people comfortable.\n\nYou said that many of your contemporaries have passed on. How do you feel each time you hear that another one is gone?\n\nAnybody can go. It can happen at any time. I was looking at the Queen the other day. Queen Elizabeth, who lost her husband recently, is two years older than me. And I looked at her; with all the power, with all the money all over the world, she is still there. Now the husband of seventy-something died. My husband died some 12 years ago. If anybody had said I would be able to live for one year without my husband, I would have said no. But you have to find a way of making yourself happy once you are alive and healthy.\n\nFirst of all you must believe in God. You must pray. Once you believe in your God, there is nothing else that will happen to you that will be too big. All my neigbours are gone. Fatai Williams, Justice Ademola, they used to come here and we would play. I can go at any time. I\u2019m ready. But I know I can\u2019t go unless it is my time. But I\u2019m so happy. God has done so much for me. I\u2019m a happy person because God made it like that.\n\nYou are always referring to your late husband. How close were you?\n\nHe was a God sent. He was like my brother. We didn\u2019t take ourselves like a husband and a wife. We were like sister and brother. Something would just happen. If he said this, it would go along with me, I would agree with him. It was not as if we never quarreled. Like every other human being, we had our differences. But when he is hot, I\u2019m cool; when I\u2019m hot, he is cool. He was a good man and I thank God for that.\n\nWhat is that thing you\u2019re not likely to forget about him in a hurry?\n\nI will never forget him because he is always there for me. Whenever we wanted to travel, he was the one that was always doing the packing and preparations because I never had the patience to do the packing properly. We travelled a lot. He would say, \u2018Funke, you can\u2019t travel like that.\u2019 He would arrange everything patiently.\n\nHe was a good man and a man of God. He believed that whatever would be would be. Anytime I was jittery over a thing he would say, \u2018Funke, don\u2019t bother yourself.\u2019 He has been looking after me since his death. There has been no problem.\n\nDo you see a woman emerging Nigerian president in the near future?\n\nYou never can tell. But the way Nigeria is planned, it could be difficult. Earlier, let us say about 25 years ago, I would have said that it was possible. But the way things are right now, I would not deceive myself. Even for a woman to become a governor, it is difficult. Out of the 36 states, do we have a state that has a woman as governor? No. It will be very difficult. To me I don\u2019t see it possible now, but maybe in the future, because anything is possible. We have so many brilliant women that would have made Nigeria better, but there is a blockage. At the moment I can\u2019t see the way unless we want to deceive ourselves.",

In an encounter with Saturday Sun, the Ozubulu-Anambra State-born Ekezie couldn\u2019t hide her frustrations.\n\nShe confessed: \u201cI\u2019m not into any serious relationship right now. I\u2019m single and available! My kind of man? I\u2019m not bothered about physical look but you wouldn\u2019t be looking like a masquerade either. I want a good-looking guy, with average (height).

Also, his brain and how his mind functions are more important to me.\u201d\n\nAnd what of his pockets? \u201cThat one is so important,\u201d Ekezie responded. \u201cI\u2019m not looking out to marry a Dangote but my man must be comfortable. He has to be able to provide for me.

I can\u2019t even snap (a picture) beside someone\u2019s car because there is no gain in it. I\u2019m honest to a fault. However, society expects more from us as celebrities. So, a lot of actors are pressured by society. Nigerians are conflicted; they want you to be humble, then the next minute, they complain that you are too modest. Women often create these problems. So, if people tend to live fake lifestyles, I won\u2019t blame them. They have to meet up.\u201d",

          "title": "Those around Buhari are leading him the wrong way \u2013Ahamba",
          "text": "Elder statesman and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ahamba has accused those around President Muhammadu Buhari of leading him down the wrong path.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, Ahamba also reminded the Igbo not to expect anyone to donate the presidency to them in 2023, even as he charged them to go all out and fight to make an Igbo man president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nMany people conclude that the Buhari government has failed. You were an associate of Buhari, or you worked with him sometime ago. Is this the Buhari you knew? What do you think changed?\n\nThe difference is that, we wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen, but those who got into government with him allowed it to happen. This is the Buhari I knew, but the problem is the people surrounding him, who want him to go the wrong way. When we were with him, we all wanted him to go the right way, but ethnic interests informed the exit of some of us because some people around him didn\u2019t allow some of us to remain with him because they know we would intervene and would not allow such things to happen. I had no quarrel with him. We didn\u2019t disagree on anything. We were just manipulated out.\n\nINEC has released the election timetable for the 2023 general elections. Some are saying certain parts of the country, like the South-East, should have it, while some others think otherwise. What is your candid opinion on this?\n\nMy candid opinion is that in this type of situation where there is no provision about rotation in the constitution, the interest of the nation demands that each part of Nigeria be given a chance. It is on that ground that I said it is best if the South-East is given a chance, not as of right, but in terms of equity and to bring peace and justice to the country.\n\nWhether they will do it or not depends on how they vote on that day. Let the candidates from South-East who want to be president move out as others are moving out and let us start assessing them. It cannot be donated. Nobody will donate presidency to the South-East. You have to fight for it. But I have not seen any candidate yet.\n\nNigeria is witnessing very challenging times, with insecurity in many parts of the country. What gave rise to this?\n\nThere is complacency in governance. Not hitting the iron while it was hot is a reason for this problem. Delay of action is dangerous, so we are just having the result of delay of action. These things have shown that they will happen in the last two or three years. Nobody did anything about them and they matured.\n\nPeople are saying that with the high level of insecurity, 2023 elections may not hold. If that comes to being what is the implication, because the tenure of this government elapses by 2023?\n\nMy granddaughter was asked by her grandmother what happened about something. The little girl asked the grandmother ,\u2018am I God?\u2019 How will I know what will happen, am I God? Let\u2019s see whether it holds or not.\n\nThen what is the legal implication if it doesn\u2019t hold?\n\nThere are provisions in the constitution about that. When that time comes, I think the Attorney General will give the relevant advice, while private lawyers will challenge or support the advice.\n\nThe Federal Government is alleging that there is a plot to overthrow the government of President Buhari. Is this a pointer that the APC government is not doing well or might have fallen out of favour with the people?\n\nThe government wants to create an opportunity to destabilise the opposition by making them suspects of a non-existence offence. That is all. I don\u2019t know what type of a security organ that will tell you that there is a plot to topple government, instead of getting ready to nip it in the bud. Last year December, there was crisis over the invasion of the Capitol in Washington DC. The security arm discovered it and reported to the appropriate body and they nipped it in the bud and it never happened.\n\nHere, we now shout it so that we can arrest innocent people and demand money from them. We have a problem in this country. If they were sharp enough to discover that there was a plot, you nip it in the bud; you don\u2019t go and allow it to happen so that you can punish people or start punishing people without it happening. I learnt the other day they were saying that they would be arresting probable people planning to destabilise the state; that they will start arresting them at home. So, if I\u2019m in my house and you are in your house and you stay there and imagine that I\u2019m plotting something, you will come to my house and arrest me because I\u2019m planning to do what is in my mind. I\u2019m a lawyer, and I know that you don\u2019t talk about a thing until a step is taken relevant to that offence you said happened.\n\nIf there is anarchy everywhere and people are complaining, is that a plot? Even the person giving the warning has seen that there is trouble. Why is he saying that somebody wants to create trouble? Can we create a worse trouble than the one we have now? All this is a mark of incompetence; they should put competent people in place. A lot of square pegs have been forced into round holes, which is part of the problems we have in this nation.\n\nSome Igbo people say, based on what the country is passing through under President Buhari, that they have been vindicated for not voting for him all along, even when he had Igbo running mates. Do you share same sentiments?\n\nDid he score 100 per cent in other places? He didn\u2019t, which means that there were Hausa-Fulani who didn\u2019t vote for him. The issue was that, who was the candidate? They preferred a candidate. It has nothing to do with ethnic or anything. At that time, they preferred a candidate to him. It is not a question of being vindicated because you didn\u2019t vote for Buhari; I reject that because I\u2019m an Igbo man, a prominent one for that matter. It was not true that anybody was against him. The issue I think was a preferred candidate at that material time and I campaigned against that position at that time. It is a political game; there is no vindication about it at all.\n\nEven when he had great Igbo men and others like you and his running mates who were also Igbo?\n\nIt depends on who he chose as running mates. Maybe if he had chosen other persons as running mates, it could have been better. I remember at that time there was hardly an election; votes were declared even when voting was going on. That was the era. I did the election petition and I have the documents; if you challenge me, I will bring the documents.\n\nDo you mean that Buhari could have won that election?\n\nEven if he did not win, he was not fairly treated at those elections.\n\nWhen you open pages or newspapers, the social media, what you read is, Nigeria is breaking up, or Nigeria will break up? Why are we having such fears at this time when other nations are conquering other planets?\n\nBreaking up of Nigeria, is it a plate? It is not easy to break up. Nigeria can disintegrate, everybody going his own way because the centre cannot hold. It is true that our constitution says that Nigeria is indissoluble. Whether it is dissoluble or indissoluble is a human act towards a project. That one may never happen, but disintegration is uncontrolled, but that shouldn\u2019t occupy our minds. What should occupy our minds is what to do to prevent it and move forward. Look at India, when I was in secondary school, they used to come here with degrees and we employed them in our secondary schools and paid them higher school salaries and now, we are running there for many things. What is wrong with us?\n\nAre you sure a worst Nigeria will not come into the disintegrated areas? You can disintegrate and in each component you have a good portion of Nigeria attitude inside it. It is the same thing. There may be worst Nigeria in the disintegrated areas. So let us solve it now that we are together. I believe that the only answer is to allow the areas some air of ability to do things for themselves at their own rate, not saying that the whole Nigeria must move at the same rate every time. Take for example, people say they want true federation, but they want salary to be the same everywhere. It can\u2019t happen in a true federation. It is not possible for some states to pay what Lagos can pay; some states cannot pay what Rivers or Kano states can pay. In a true federation, things should be according to those areas, but the Nigerian Labour Congress said it would destabilise Nigeria if you go to true federation with labour matters. People say they want true federation, yet they want the Federal Government to fund local governments while the states create the local governments. This is incongruous. If we want true federalism, we will have it. If we don\u2019t want, we continue with what I call \u2018unitary federalism\u2019 which is a new trend in politics.\n\nIn this direction, are you calling for restructuring, but many are still confused over how it is going to be carried out?\n\nI stand for restructuring; I don\u2019t stand for secession of any part of Nigeria. Let us restructure and go back to our federation agreement. We agreed on certain things before we became a federation. Let us revisit those things and see the ones we can take now and there will be peace in this place.\n\nWhen the current leadership says restructuring is not an option, what other options do we have?\n\nWe keep crying and trying to get it right, but in the end, we may come to Chinua Achebe, \u2018Things Fall Apart\u2019 and in another book, \u2018The Centre Cannot Hold\u2019. When the centre cannot hold, things will fall apart.\n\nAs it is in Nigeria today, what are the consequences of things falling apart?\n\nIt portends anarchy because before instability, there will be anarchy. We can ill afford that.\n\nSome people hold the view that Britain is the architect of our woes. They say Nigeria remains the last experiment of the British government, as other nations they brought together have gone their separate ways, each enjoying peace. They mention India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and others. What do you say to this?\n\nI agree, but what we don\u2019t know is why they decided to remain together when others were going their ways, because there is nothing happening now that the leadership of those days didn\u2019t see. Look, Southern Cameroun was part of Nigeria and they quickly eased themselves off, but the others remained together. I asked at the National Conference that our elders have not told us why they remained together when others were going their ways. Until we get that question answered, we may not know why they continued. If you look at the constitution, you find out that as at the time we got independent, regions have prime ministers, not premiers and they have their own governors, apart from governors general. They had their own constitution, but in 1978, some people went to the Constituent Assembly. I don\u2019t know whether they understood what they were doing. They said they were creating a federal constitution and they said there is only one constitution, the national constitution. There we became a unitary federalism and now we are crying. We were doing parliamentary system, but they said it is presidential they wanted. When you have to send people for something, you send people that know the issue, but you find good tailors and good carpenters who know nothing about law being sent to constitutional conferences. I do not know what we have now that was not there then. What we have to do now is to find a solution. Let\u2019s stop talking of how we came to this point; let us find a solution to our present circumstance and find out how we can remain together because if we split in a disorganised manner, it will be very bad.\n\nTalking about the 1999 Constitution, many people argue that what was agreed on is not what we have in the constitution. They said then Head of State, Abdulasam Abubakar handed over the document to Prof Awual Yadudu, who doctored it and produced what we have now.\n\nI don\u2019t like this lamentation about the 1999 Constitution. It is 99 per cent of what was in the 1979 Constitution. Before you complain of the 1999 Constitution, you have to first complain of the 1979 Constitution. If the problem started with the 1979 Constitution, why do you allow it to continue in 1999? Who did you send to the Constituent Assembly? I keep saying it, why would you send people who don\u2019t know anything about constitution to represent you in a constitutional conference? Everything is political and here we are today. The question of accepting the 1979 Constitution and holding the 1999 Constitution as fraud is not acceptable to me because they are the same. If people scampered to go and occupy offices based on the constitution, why did they go there instead of rejecting the constitution and face the military? Silence is acceptance.\n\nBut when Obasanjo came into power, one of his advisers said as the military has been eased off, their next plan was to work on an acceptable constitution. But that never came to pass?\n\nIt is not easy. Those who said that never knew how tedious it is making a constitution in a civilian regime; it is not as easy as making it under a military regime. In an undeveloped country like ours where everything is selfishly considered, not nationally considered, it is not easy. It was a wrong move to accept it first and then reject it later. That was a cowardly approach to a situation.\n\nHow do we move forward?\n\nThe National Assembly has power to make laws for peace, order and good government in Nigeria. That is their jurisdiction. They should make a law creating a constitutional conference or a constituent assembly to give us another constitution. We need to sit down and discuss our problem. We need to sit and discuss this situation of somebody having the power to make appointment of one ethnic group, a minority for that matter, for the whole country. The National Assembly should know its responsibility. When a president or governor begins to act contrary to the constitution, they have a duty to remove him from office. But what do we have now? It is our party; it is not our party. They go there to worship party and not the peace, good, order of government that the constitution asks them to do. I can\u2019t do anything about that. I will only complain as I have been complaining. Where I see such a thing I will speak out and go back to my house. If we follow 60 per cent of what is in that constitution, there will be peace in Nigeria.\n\nYou said the National Assembly should make a law to set up a constitutional conference or constituent assembly that will midwife a new constitution. But they said there is no need for that as they were already there to amend the constitution.\n\nThey have no power to amend the constitution. Go to Section Nine, the word, \u2018alter\u2019. Not to alter or amend the constitution; they can alter any provision of the constitution but not to alter or amend the constitution. If you say there is no difference between alteration and amendment, it is not true. It is just like saying that there is no difference between epidemic and pandemic. One contains the other; they are not the same. They think they are doing the right thing, but they are derailing. All these going around in the name of constitutional amendments are just a waste of time.",

          "title": "Untold story of Rev Fr. Mbaka",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nFiery Catholic priest, Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka is in the eye of the storm. Thousands of worshipers and members of his Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), on Wednesday, took to the streets of Enugu in violent protest over the sudden disappearance of their Spiritual Director.\n\nAt the end of the protest, which lasted over four hours, property belonging to the Catholic Church, including the residence of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, were destroyed.\n\nThe protest, which had never been witnessed in the state almost, led to anarchy in the town. It was quelled when the \u2018missing\u2019 Mbaka reappeared in a black SUV at about 2.50pm, urging his followers to go back to their homes or the Adoration Ground, that he was safe.\n\nBut before then, the residence of the bishop had been vandalized; windows were shattered while air conditioners were damaged. Even water installations were not spared. It took the intervention of some individuals to stop the house from being set ablaze.\n\nMbaka has been in the public eye for quite some time. In 2014, he had prophesised that General Muhammadu Buhari, then presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would defeat former President Goodluck Jonathan in the 2015 polls.\n\nHis prophecy drew the ire of many, especially in the old Eastern region where Jonathan had teeming supporters.\n\nBarely three years later, he spoke vehemently against the same Buhari\u2019s government that he had prayed for. He warned Nigerian leaders of a looming disaster, which he said would be sparked by the unmitigated bloodletting in the country, while calling on the President to go to Rome to atone for the human carnage going on in the country under his watch.\n\n\u201cSupernatural disaster is coming. Angels are already warming up. Nigerians should not worry; one day there will be vacancy from Abuja. The jet will park and nobody will use it unless they repent.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, had it been that it was the Imams that were killed in Benue or Plateau, the president would have attended their burials.\n\n\u201cGod can prophesy someone into a position. If you know how Nebuchadnezzar became the President. He went there under prophetic order. When God wants to punish His people, He can use a leader. The Nebucadnezzar God later pushed into the bush.\u201d\n\nHe further said that President Buhari was like an egg that was bound to meet a sledgehammer in the nearest future, charging those who were close to the president to ensure he got his message.\n\nHe called himself a microphone speaking as directed by God warning that anybody who would want to attack him because of the message would meet his waterloo.\n\nThat is Rev. Father Camillus Ejike Mbaka, Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry of Enugu, Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nArguably, one of the most unconventional Catholic priests in Nigeria; Mbaka\u2019s methods and tactics have endeared him to many, with thousands of followers trooping to the adoration ground located at Umuchigbo, Iji Nike; Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State for spiritual encounter every Friday. For all the followership, Mbaka is no stranger to controversies; he rather seems at home with them. No wonder one can hardly think of any other priest that divides opinion more than the charismatic priest.\n\nIn fact, Mbaka said during the first physical service of his church after about five months of closure due to lockdown occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic that the country goes \u2018gaga\u2019 anytime he declares prophecies.\n\nHe said, \u201cLike you know, whenever we declare a prophecy here, the whole country goes gaga and they begin to plan evil. But woe betides whoever that should allow himself to be used to try any attack on me or this ministry.\n\n\u201cYou may not like me; I may not be among those you consider as good people, but I know that God is using me to save people and minister succour to mankind.\u201d\n\nFamily background and journey to priesthood\n\nFr. Mbaka is the only son of late Chief Humphrey and Felicia Mbaka. He hails from Amata Ituku in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Humphrey Mbaka\u2019s family stood out for their special talent in palm wine tapping in the community. Ejike as a child helped his father in his palm wine business. He was also close to his mother as he always helped out in domestic chores.\n\nDespite the demand of domestic activities, the young Mbaka also devoted time to Block Rosary. He stood out as one of the leaders of the group at St. Anthony\u2019s Parish, Ituku where he led the prayer team. His father, who was a traditional religion worshipper, seemed to have tolerated his tilt to Christianity until he declared his intention to enter priesthood. This was met with stiff resistance by his late father who allegedly made life a living hell for the intending priest.\n\nMbaka attended St. Vincent\u2019s Secondary School, Agbogugu in Awgu L.G.A of Enugu State, from where he proceeded to the Seat of Wisdom Seminary, Owerri, Imo State and St Joseph\u2019s Seminary Ikot Ekpene in Akwa Ibom State, for his training as a priest. He was ordained a priest on July 29, 1995 and was subsequently posted to Holy Ghost Cathedral, headquarters of Catholic Church in Enugu Diocese as the Assistant Diocesan Administrator.\n\nHe later ventured out on evangelical missions to Capuchin; a religious order of Franciscan friars within the Catholic Church, and Government Technical College (GTC), Enugu, where he founded the Word Prayer Centre of the Eucharistic Jesus which later metamorphosed to the Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN).\n\nIt was gathered that those early years of priesthood were unbearable for Mbaka as he would hold Mass at the GTC and shortly after the service; the church leadership would come and retrieve the offering. He was not allowed access to the offering; neither was he given accommodation.\n\nAt some point, he lived with a couple in their one-room apartment in the GRA; and most times slept in the car. It was from there that some members who saw the efficacy of his prayers rented a place for him before they eventually commenced putting up structures for the Christ the King\u2019s Parish (CKP), which hosted the adoration ground at the GRA.\n\nHuge crowds troop to the adoration ground every Friday from all parts of the country in search of spiritual encounter. The atmosphere is usually charged and electrifying such that one gets the exact buzz that goes with the Pentecostal fellowships.\n\nAccording to one of the choristers in the ministry, Oluchi Okolo, the singers usually have their works cut out for them as they are expected to sing and keep everyone \u201cin the realm of the spirit\u201d until the man of God arrives. She said once the man of God is sighted, the atmosphere becomes more intense and shouts of \u201cDaddy\u201d, \u201cOga Ndi Oga\u201d, \u201cNwa Ikuku\u201d, \u201c Onyeisi Okanga\u201d, \u201cOga Emma\u201d, and so many other appendages with which Mbaka is known rend the air. She described the feeling as blissful.\n\nThe all-night service proper at the Adoration Ground can best be described as Pentecostal-Catholicism. Without being told, a first time visitor will think he was in a Pentecostal gathering until it was time for the Holy Communion and the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDescribing worship at the Adoration Ground, an observer wrote: \u2018Worship here combines preaching, ecstatic Eucharistic adoration, two Masses, anointing and dance in a way that is hard to imagine for anyone who has not seen it before. Mbaka is a celebrity and a force in the entire South East region, supported by many followers and clergy.\u2019\n\nHowever, in 2016, Mbaka was transferred from the CKP where he had presided for 20 years to Our Lady\u2019s Catholic Church, Emene; a small parish in an obscure part of Enugu as an assistant priest.\n\nHis exit from CKP on January 31, 2016 was a highly emotional exercise as he was escorted by thousands of Catholic faithful in Enugu to his new parish.\n\nSeveral lorries, buses and cars all lined the street in what could be dubbed a triumphal exit that halted economic and other activities for over four hours along major streets where the long convoy passed.\n\nAddressing the crowd before the movement, Mbaka had expressed reservations over the transfer, which he said was calculated to make him suffer by certain leaders of the church.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know we are going to suffer within now and few months to come. I am going to suffer and suffer; I know that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to suffer because I have no place to put my head. I am going to suffer because I have no place to keep the Adoration Ministry\u2019s assets. I know I\u2019m going to suffer.\n\n\u201cFortunately, it is going to happen in the month of lent. So, I am going to use my exit here as a Lenten observance./ but Jesus said it all in John 16:20 to his apostles that you will be sorrowful and the world will be rejoicing but very soon I will turn your sorrow to joy.\n\n\u201cThe quantum of the assets of the Adoration Ministry is the only thing I am bothered about for now. Where am I going to keep them? I am going to stay in one small room that has only one small bed, one small table, little toilet and bathroom.\n\n\u201cSo, where am I going to keep all the Adoration assets? My clothing and books I can keep in the car or somebody\u2019s house but where will I keep these assets that I have given to the Catholic Church of Enugu? But I say may God take the glory and whoever that has offended me, I have forgiven.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fight anybody or even dream of battling anybody. If anybody allows the devil to use him, the same that advised you to make a mistake will laugh at you when you cry over the error. The baby is born, there is no going back.\n\n\u201cWe are moving out. We have been doing it and we will do it again.\u201d\n\nActually, many had thought that heavens would fall over the transfer. The manner the whole thing died down attracted the envy of former Vice President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop John Praise Daniel who extolled the legendary discipline in the orthodox Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cI know if it were in a Pentecostal church, a church would have started the following day. A man with over 30, 000 worshippers still agreed to leave everything to one small church. It\u2019s discipline,\u201d he had remarked.\n\nLife of giving\n\nIn early 2020, Fr. Mbaka shocked both his followers and non-followers alike when he disclosed that he spends about $2 million (over N700 million) monthly on charity works. The priest through his Multi-Live Savers for the Less Privileged has positively changed the lives of many indigent persons nationwide.\n\nDuring the event marking his 25th year of priestly ordination, one of his followers, Anita Ogonna, praised him saying: \u201cFr Mbaka, you are not a saint or the best among all, but I respect you so much in all your physical and spiritual doings, you are a man who converted his money for private jet to give many poor people a home, you converted your pomposity to give young people hope, you restored many even at the point of death. You did not consider your ministry as a competition with others. You are really a shadow of emulation, prophet of contentment, man of generosity, prophet of humility, prophet of the poor, one among the givers of our time\u201d.\n\nThe priest distributed over 4,000 bags of rice, condiments and clothes to less privileged members of the adoration family as part of his 2018 Christmas and New Year gifts.\n\nHaruna Ayuba who led a group of Northern Christians to the programme said: \u201cAll these good works and miracles of God through Fr Mbaka still confirm that in spite of all the attacks on him, the hand of God is still upon him and his ministry.\u201d\n\nHis many controversies\n\nMbaka is synonymous with controversies. From his frosty relationship with the then Governor of Enugu State, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani to the standoff with former President Goodluck Jonathan and then to the recent prophecy on the Imo State Governorship position, Mbaka\u2019s penchant for toeing paths other preachers would love to avoid could be clearly seen.\n\nNnamani was the first to taste the bitter pill from Mbaka. It was a tough eight years for the governor, as he found in Mbaka a man he could not handle. It was literally a battle of superiority between the two. Their friction got to its peak with the death of 14 worshippers following a stampede at the Adoration Ground; an incident Mbaka blamed on the then Governor. But Nnamani denied complicity in the incident and has continued to plead innocence till date.\n\nMbaka allegedly went ahead to prophesy that Nnamani would not win re-election in 2003. However, the governor won convincingly at the polls. He also contested and won a senatorial position in 2007 after serving his second term as governor.\n\nHis statements unarguably contributed to the failure of Chief Ikedi Ohakim to win re-election as governor of Imo State in 2011. The priest has since made up with the former governor.\n\nOn December 31, 2014, Mbaka shocked Nigerians, especially the entire South-East region as he prophesied against the re-election bid of the then President, Jonathan, whom he dubbed bad luck. In his New Year message for 2015, titled \u201cFrom good luck to bad luck,\u201d the priest tore the former president to shreds as he detailed his failure in tackling corruption and insecurity in the country.\n\nHe prophesied that the then opposition candidate, Buhari, would win at the polls. During the sermon at the Christ the King Catholic Parish, GRA, Enugu, Sunday, January 4, 2015, Mbaka said that he had been receiving threats.\n\n\u201cSurely, they shall gather, but because the gathering is not of God they shall scatter. No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper. They said Buhari gave me money, but I have never met with Buhari. I don\u2019t know him in person. I only delivered the message I was given and I stand by that message because the future of this country is bleak with Jonathan on the saddle,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the controversy raged; even many of Mbaka\u2019s staunch followers found it hard to accept it, with a lot of them suggesting that the priest had really dabbled into politics.\n\nOne of the celebrated attacks Mbaka received was a musical video by a local artiste known as BBC, titled: \u201cMbaka Why?\u201d The video further poured fuel into an already burning furnace. BBC went ahead to list a number of failed prophesies allegedly delivered by Mbaka and predicted that his prophecy against the president would fail likewise.\n\nMbaka\u2019s prophecy came to fruition as Jonathan was roundly defeated at the polls and the priest was vindicated.\n\nAnother controversial prophecy was the Imo State Governorship position which was at the time at the Supreme Court. The candidate of the PDP, Chief Emeka Ihedioha had won the election and was declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) but Mbaka prophesied, even though Iheadioha had been sworn in as governor, that the candidate of the APC, Senator Hope Uzodimma would become governor of the state.\n\nMbaka advised those who might find the message unpalatable not to come after him, warning that such action would attract the wrath of the Holy Spirit upon such individuals.\n\n\u201cMany things are going to happen in Nigeria this 2020 that will shock countrymen and countrywomen; but all would be to God\u2019s glory. In spite of all that would happen this 2020, there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn Imo State, there is hope. Hope, hope, hope in Imo State! Imo people have suffered but God is raising a new hope that would be an agent of salvation for them. He\u2019s coming with a new flag to restore the dignity of that noble land.\n\n\u201cA new leadership that will break barriers and there would be joy in the land of Imo. Lift your candles as I bless Hope Uzodimma; and I empower him to, spiritually, to take over. How, I do not know.\n\n\u201cPlease, if you heard that there would be a new government in Imo and you don\u2019t like the message; if I say Hope, you can say hopeless but do not fight me.\n\n\u201cI am saying this in respect of those who may want to come after me because of the message. If you do that, the God of Moses, Elijah and Elisha will deal with you. I am only a messenger of God\u201d, he said.\n\nMany Nigerians, including priests, attacked Mbaka for making a prophecy that was at the time seen as impossible as they believed that Uzodimma did not even stand a chance even if Ihedioha should lose at the apex court.\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Imo State, and other religious leaders berated Mbaka over the prophecy insisting that it was politically motivated.\n\nAlso, the Imo State Chapter of National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) in a statement in Owerri by its Chairman, Isidore Chukwuemeka, asked: \u201cWhere was Mbaka when Imo State was serially raped for eight years by a clueless administration that mindlessly looted the treasury of the state?\u201d\n\nEven after the prophecy was fulfilled, some people still continued their attack on Mbaka. Senior Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, Adewale Giwa said that he was not surprised to see the fulfilment of the prediction by Rev. Fr. Mbaka that Uzodimma would be declared Imo State Governor by the court as Mbaka was a partisan prophet, adding that he must have got the hint of the judgement before speaking.\n\nGiwa said: \u201cWhen a partisan prophet speaks, we surely know who gives him the hint. This is a concluded deal among them.\n\n\u201cIs it not the same prophet who enters Aso Rock, wining and dining with the President? We know where they all belong. Check my record, I stand by the truth at all times and the truth will eventually prevail in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMbaka later admitted that the prophecy was a risky one but cautioned people against attacking him or his prophesies. In a statement released weeks after Uzodimma was declared the substantive governor of Imo State.\n\n\u201cHelp me to correct the mendacious, heinous and horrendous impression given by the press over my relationship with my bishop. I have no problem with my bishop. Am I forgiving him for what? I didn\u2019t say that I have forgiven my bishop as they reported.\n\n\u201cI rather opined that I have forgiven all those who maligned me when I prophesied, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, that Hope Uzodimma is going to be the governor of Imo state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary and secondary school, I had started seeing vision and doing mysterious things by God. Attacking me is a waste of time. That will not stop God in sending messages to me. So, you attackers, use your time and do meaningful something for yourself,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the wake of the crisis generated by Mbaka\u2019s prophecy, Bishop Callistus Onaga had instructed the Catholic faithful to disregard the prophecy.\n\nBut Mbaka had wondered why there was so much negative reaction to his Imo prophecy than when he prophesied late General Sani Abacha\u2019s death, late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death, as well as Buhari\u2019s take over from former President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cAll these came to pass, why is this one so catastrophic? Those who attacked me, who is now a loser? Is it you or me? Holy Spirit told me that Hope Uzodimma was going to become the governor of Imo State and I should obey God rather.\n\nHe cautioned the church and all those who were perturbed by his God\u2019s gift that they should know his gift did not just come when he became a priest.\n\nThe Catholic priest had on January 15, held the first thanksgiving for Uzodimma at the Adoration Ground, a day after the apex court sacked Ihedioha as governor.\n\nHis other controversies\n\nMbaka had described former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as Bureau de Change because of the mindboggling foreign currencies that reportedly exchanged hands at the last National Convention of the PDP in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, before he emerged the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2019 elections.\n\nRegardless, he warned him not to emulate Buhari if he was elected the president.\n\nMbaka stated that the President had all the human and materials resources at his disposal to make the country better but rather chose to play ethnic, despotic politics by surrounding himself with people without vision and not inclined to his line of thought. He noted that Buhari had wasted a golden opportunity offered him by God and by implication disobeyed God.\n\nHe also described the cost of the APC\u2019s expression of interest and nomination forms as outrageous; saying that if the leadership of the party had conscience, they would not have collected N24 million from people to obtain the forms. He added that a party with conscience would have returned the money to the aspirants instead of casting aspersions on them.\n\nAlthough Mbaka had predicted defeat for the ruling party in the elections but he said that there was still opportunity for change. He further warned Buhari that the \u201cprice of disobedience is disgrace.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if Atiku had the opportunity that the president has, he would have revamped Nigeria.\n\nEventually, when Buhari won the election, Mbaka said that Atiku had lost it in the spiritual realm the day he (Mbaka) apologised to his running mate, Obi.\n\nHe was to later celebrate President Buhari\u2019s victory in the Presidential polls on March 27; where he said that God had honoured his prophecy.\n\nMbaka said had the President lost in the polls, his ministry would have been closed down. \u201cBut our God is a humongous miracle. He has answered our prayers. I am happy. I am filled with joy. On this altar, we will decree and it will come to pass. Anybody I support will be victorious.\u201d\n\nHe declared that even if the Presidential polls were cancelled, Atiku and Obi would still lose a rerun because \u201cthe ways of God are not the ways of man. People should stop playing God\u201d.\n\nPrior to this period, the Human Rights Writers Association (HURIWA) had in January 2016, threatened to drag Mbaka to the Vatican following his prophecy on plots to kill Buhari. Leader of the group, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko had asked the Nigerian Catholic hierarchy to sanction the priest for abandoning his sacred vocation and deviating into the profane and mundane roadside career of high wire politics under the canopy of his Catholic\u2019s priestly vocation.\n\nVoice of the voiceless\n\nMbaka\u2019s closeness to Governor Ugwuanyi did not stop him from speaking out for the people as he openly decried the recent demolition of structures in Enugu by the Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority in its bid to restore the original master plan of the capital city.\n\nThe outspoken priest had described the action of the Enugu State Government as an atrocity against the people.\n\nAccording to him, the immensity of suffering and economic hardships in the country did not warrant the demolition of people\u2019s shops without giving them time, or providing alternative areas for them.\n\n\u201cIf you want to restore the master plan of 1933 in Enugu State, you should do it holistically. There are some areas where the master plan was flouted but because they belonged to the echelon political class, government is afraid of pulling the structures there down.\n\n\u201cWhat about Zoo Estate? The place that was made for animals\u2019 residence is now being harboured by human beings, so, you don\u2019t take justice one-sided; whoever errs must be punished. When I see you people destroying those ones, I now know that you are out to restore the original master plan of Enugu,\u201d Mbaka stated.\n\nMeanwhile mixed reactions have trailed the whole episode of his disappearance and reappearance. Former Federal Commissioner of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Executive Director of Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), blamed the diocesan bishop for allowing him the latitude of growing wings within the church.\n\nHe urged the Bishop of Enugu diocese to go ahead and close down the Adoration Ground, saying Mbaka should be defrocked and laicized if he became rebellious.\n\nOnwubiko said: \u201cI think the Bishop made a mistake to have allowed Rev Fr Mbaka to grow almost much bigger than his diocese by running his own ministry to the detriment of the core responsibilities for which he was ordained.\n\nIPOB seeks support for Mbaka\n\nMeanwhile, the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, in an audio broadcast has warned people from the South-East not to condemn the cleric.\n\nKanu reiterated that there are Nigerians like the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami and Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai who have grievous cases hanging on them, and appear to be sacred cows in Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cIn a normal country so to speak, the condemnation of Father Mbaka, you may welcome it somehow. I know sometimes regardless of our shortcomings, we are brutal in the way we think. We see what is bad and say it\u2019s bad.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is doing it. That\u2019s why a lot of people came down heavily on Father Mbaka but I\u2019m telling you this, yes in Biafra, we can do anything we like to him. But, in Nigeria, as far as Nigeria is concerned, never ever condemn your own,\u201d Kanu said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld deregistration of 74 political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their inability to win any election after the 2019 general polls.\n\nJustice Adamu Jauro, who delivered the judgment of the apex court in a virtual court session on Friday, held that the deregistration of the affected political parties, including National Unity Party (NUP) was in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act. The judgment has to a large extent, sealed the fate of the remaining 73 parties many of whom have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. The Commission, which had on February 6, 2020, announced deregistration of the 74 political parties, hinged it on their failure to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitutional Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has determined that eighteen (18) political parties have fulfilled the requirements for an existence based on Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as follows,\u201d the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said. The Abuja division of the Federal High Court had in it\u2019s judgment, affirmed the power of the Independent National Electoral Commission to deregister political parties, which failed to comply with the provisions of the law particularly Section 225 A of the 1999 Constitution as amended. Justice Jauro, in his judgment delivered in the suit filed by the National Unity Party, one of the 74 parties deregistered by the INEC in February, affirmed that the constitutional power of the electoral commission and the reasons given by the Commission for deregistration of parties are valid, in conformity with the law, sacrosanct and could not be affected by the fact of anticipated Local government elections by some states, which dates were not fixed, certain or even ascertainable. The court, therefore, held that deregistration of National Unity Party as a political party in Nigeria was lawfully done in exercise of vested constitutional powers of the INEC in accordance with Section 225A of the 1999 Constitution. The judgment conclusively terminated the legal existence of the party and also all its other rights and obligations. With the ruling, all pending appeals by other deregistered parties are now an academic exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the judgment, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, hailed the judgment and said the judgment had ended all speculations and this will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.",

          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nThe Defence Ministry on Friday further gave an insight into how the controversial $1 billion released by President Muhammadu Buhari to procure arms was expended on the purpose for which it was released while waiting for the products\u2019 arrival about three years after.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Musa Istifanus, who stated this as a guest of honour at the Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) 2021 Summit in Kaduna, added that the procurement was made to address the security threats currently bedevilling the country.\n\nAccording to him, those that were raising dust about the funds were doing so out of ignorance of how the funds were used for the purpose it was raised. He maintained that, \u201cthe Nigerian Government had spent N1 billion dollars in acquiring weapons for the war against the insurgency it is facing.\n\n\u201cSome ignorant people say that they have not seen any weapon. I know where the weapons are. They are yet to come. We paid $496millon to the American government and it is getting to three years now, the Super Tucanos are yet to arrive. Last week, we received an email that it will come on July 21\u201d, he said.\n\nTo DICON, he said, \u201cmanpower development which you identified as one of the key points that encompasses training, is key to the success of DICON, especially where you will want to use research and development to chart the course of your success.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and the Ministry of Defence looks forward to seeing DICON attain a highly productive and profitable cooperation in our collective national desire to attain self-reliance and self-sufficiency in our defence and security needs,\u201d he said\n\nEarlier, the Executive Vice Chairman of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), Prof M S Haruna, who was represented at the event by Dr Ibrahim Onuwo Abdulmalik, called on business giants like Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola and others to support the Nigerian Industrial Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) for the security of their investments.\n\n\u201cIf we have the richest man in Africa on Nigerian soil, and he\u2019s not supporting DICON, maybe, we are not even talking to him. We are not talking to Dangote; we are not talking to Otedola and the rest of them. We must talk to them because if we are under threat of external aggressors, their investments are not safe,\u201d he said. In an address, the new Director-General of DICON, Major General Moses Uzoh noted that concerted efforts have been made in the past to achieve the objectives of DICON especially, as it relates to the establishment of a military-industrial complex in Nigeria.\n\nDICON was established in 1964 Act of Parliament to produce defence materials for members of the armed forces and other security agencies.",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe suspension of Ms Hadiza Bala-Usman as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority last Thursday by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, against civil service rules for the removal of heads of MDAs, was the culmination of the personal desire of the minister to remove Hadiza and truncate her second term as Managing Director of agency.\n\nHadiza was not told what her offences were or formally communicated, before her suspension was announced by the presidency.\n\nNot querying her or making her aware of her offence(s) before suspending her is a clear breach of the processes stipulated in the government\u2019s own regulation for disciplining heads of government agencies. A government circular dated May 19, 2020, and endorsed by the Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, stipulated that when there is an issue of impropriety against the head of an agency, the federal government requires a minister, through the permanent secretary of the supervising ministry, to refer the matter to the governing board of the affected agency in line with its enabling law and chapters three and 16 of the Public Service Rules on discipline in government parastatals.\n\nThe board will then issue the affected official a query and subsequently advise the minister of its findings and recommendations. But if the board itself is the source of the allegation of misconduct against the chief executive or the chief executive is the chairman of the board, the minister, on the advice of the permanent secretary, still has to ensure a query is issued, requesting an explanation from the accused official.\n\nIn this case, neither the governing board nor the SGF was carried along before action was taking against Hadiza.\n\nIn the beginning, it was all well between Amaechi and Hadiza, who closely worked together when the minister was DG of the Buhari campaign and Hadiza was a close confidant of candidate Buhari, resulting in Amaechi recommending her as MD of NPA. When Amaechi became transport minister, things began to degenerate when he found Hadiza too independent to rein her in or control and the suspended MD would not serve in his court full of political courtiers.\n\nThings came to a head when Amaechi wanted to renew all dredging contractors of NPA. Many of the contractors had served for decades and Amaechi got Hadiza to cancel her public advertisement for bid but was later overruled by the BPE, acting on the orders of the president that a public bid be held.\n\nThe crisis deepened from one contract to the other as Hadiza insisted on due process and more often had presidential backing to the anger of Amaechi, who then promised that Hadiza would be a one term MD. To the minister\u2019s shock and consternation, Hadiza got a second term without his input and since then vowed to oust her.\n\nThe first attempt was when Amaechi accused Hadiza and the NPA of not auditing their books and recommended KPMG Nigeria; Deloitte Nigeria; Price Water House Coopers, Ernst and Young and Mckinsey and Company Nigeria. The Auditor-General of the Federation informed Amaechi that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe Auditor General of the Federation also told the minister that the NPA was in compliance with yearly audit unlike other government agencies.\n\nFrom that, the crisis culminated into the issue over remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds between 2016 and 2020 to Consolidated Revenue Funds (CRF) and the CBN.\n\nBefore Hadiza could respond to the query to show that NPA had indeed been remitting to the CRF and the CBN, Amaechi got the President to approve her ouster without due process on the pretext that a panel had been set up to probe her management of then agency. Ironically, the person to act for her while on suspension is the Executive Director, Finance of NPA, Mohammed Koko, who was not suspended, despite the planned probe of NPA\u2019s finances.\n\nThe Minister alleged that the NPA under Hadiza could not account for N165.320 billion between 2018 and 2020 in the record of its remittance of operations surplus to the Consolidated Revenue Funds. Amaechi in a letter addressed to the office of the President on March this year, alleged that NPA\u2019s yearly remittance of operating surpluses from year 2016-2020 fell short of the actual amount due for actual remittance.\n\nAmaechi wrote: \u201cIn view of the above, I wish to suggest that the financial account of the activities of Nigerian Ports Authority be investigated for the period 2016-2020 to ascertain the true financial position and the outstanding unremitted balance of One hundred and sixty-five billion, three hundred and twenty million, nine hundred and sixty-two thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven naira only (N165,320,962,697).\u201d\n\nThe minister therefore sought that \u201cthe account and remittance of NPA in the period of 2018-2020 be audited to account for the gross shortfall of remitted public funds.\u201d\n\nThe Presidency, in a letter dated March 30, and which was signed by the Chief of Staff to the President granted the prayers of the Transport Minister on the need to audit the books of NPA\n\nHowever, there was a drama as the office of the Auditor General of the Federation clarified that the NPA Act did not give anyone the responsibility of authorising the Auditor General of the Federation to audit its accounts. It however explained that it is within the purview of the office of the Auditor General of the Federation to provide NPA with a list of auditors qualified to be appointed by them as external auditors, among others.\n\nIn the memo signed by the Auditor-General of the Federation, the Transport Minister was informed that the NPA had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana and Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants in that respect.\n\nThe memo also said that both firms had audited and published the audited accounts of NPA as approved by the board for 2016, 2017 and 2018, adding that the audit of 2019 was ongoing, awaiting NPA\u2019s approval to be published.\n\nApparently not satisfied with the position of the AGF, Amaechi, through a memo issued by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Magdalene Ajani and addressed to the Auditor-General of the Federation, called for a holistic audit of all financial activities of the NPA and went further to list some selected audit firms for the job.\n\nThose familiar with the crisis said it has been a cat and mouse relationship between the Minister and the embattled chief executive of NPA, for over five years climaxing in the rejection of the record of NPA\u2019s remittance of operations\u2019 surplus to the CRF.\n\nThe cat and mouse relationship between Amaechi and Hadiza was also fuelled by the suspicion that the executive director was too close to the supervising minister, a development that was said to have raised the fear that the director had been leaking some sensitive information especially of the finances of NPA to the Minister.\n\nKoko is known to be close to Amaechi in his days as governor of Rivers State. Koko was then a staff of Zenith Bank in Port Harcourt.\n\nThere was also the battle over the sack of Intels, a major contractor of NPA by Bala-Usman. The firm was a major sponsor of APC in the 2015 election and the transport minister was looking towards the firm for support in 2023. Amaechi wanted Intels badly but Hadiza denied him.\n\nPolitical Tweets\n\nBala-Usman finally played into the hands of those plotting her ouster with her recent political tweet on the state of the nation.\n\nReacting to the rising insecurity in the country, Hadiza on February 27, tweeted, \u201cThe state of insecurity in the country that has led to the kidnap of Kagara boys and Zamfara girls need to be addressed urgently\u2026We can\u2019t go on like this! Rescue our children and secure our country that\u2019s all we ask\u2026#SecureNorth #SecureNigeria.\u201d\n\nThe tweets caught the attention of her opponents who intensified moves to remove her for daring to take on a government which she served.\n\nPresident Buhari and her other sympathisers in the Presidency could no longer help her case when attention were called to the tweet which presented her as a sharp critic of the administration, who could no longer be trusted because of the suspicion that she might be working for the opposition.\n\nBala-Usman\u2019s last-Minute Efforts\n\nHowever, Bala-Usman, who got wind of the plot against her, had on Wednesday fired a memo addressed to the Chief of Staff to the President, stating her position and calling for involvement of the office of the Accountant General of the Federation to establish the true position of the authorities\u2019 remittances.\n\nIn the memo she personally signed, Bala-Usman explained that the Authority\u2019s computation of its remittances to the CFR are concluded arising from numbers from the audited financial statements using the template forwarded to the authority from the Fiscal Responsibility Commission and not budgetary provision.\n\nShe insisted that the NPA has remitted the full amount due it to CFR for the periods 2017 and 2018 arising from the operating surplus derived from the audited financial statement for the period totalling N76.384 billion as evidenced in treasury receipts.\n\nAccording to her, NPA had remitted a total of N82.687billion for the period 2019 and 2020 pending the audit of the financial statement at which point the amount so much computed arising from the value of the operating surplus to the audited financial statement will be remitted to the CFR.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that the Chief of Staff requests the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation who are the statutorily custodian of status of payment to the CRF to provide clartrue position of the Authorities remittances to the CFR,\u201d she submitted.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, pundits are wondering if President Buhari will discard his adopted daughter for an unreliable former governor of Rivers State who ditched his predecessor Peter Odili and not on speaking terms with his successor, Nyesom Wike.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says sack of 74 parties complied with extant provisions of Constitution, Electoral Act\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court of Nigeria yesterday put a final lid on the prospect of reinstating the 74 political parties deregistered by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for failure to win any elective position in the 2019 general election, when it ruled that the deregistration of one of the affected parties, National Unity Party (NUP), is constitutional.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous judgment delivered virtually by Justice Chima Nweze upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal which had earlier affirmed the deregistration of the NUP.\n\nBy this action, the apex court has sealed the fate of the remaining 73 deregistered parties, many of which have their appeals still pending in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.\n\nThe NUP had challenged its deregistration by INEC in line with the laws and in compliance with the extant provisions of the Constitution and Electoral Act.\n\nIt noted that INEC \u201chas the legal power\u201d to deregister the affected political party.\n\nThe Supreme Court, by affirming the concurrent findings of the lower courts on the NUP case, has upheld not only the powers of INEC to deregister political parties, but also that the process and procedure adopted for the deregistration of the 74 political parties was in compliance with extant laws.\n\nPrior to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement yesterday, INEC was faced with multiple cases by the deregistered political parties, with the courts giving conflicting judgements.\n\nIn one of such cases by some of the 74 deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja, had in a judgment delivered on July 29, 2020, affirmed the powers of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nThe appellate court in a unanimous decision presented by Justice Mohammed Idris, held that INEC acted within the constitutional provisions, as well as the Electoral Act in sacking the political parties, which failed to win a single office in the last general election.\n\nConsequently, the Court of Appeal nullified and set aside the judgment of Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier nullified INEC\u2019s deregistration of the political parties on the grounds that the deregistration breached Section 225(a) of the Constitution. The affected parties headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe said constitutional provision -Section 225(a) \u2013 spells out the minimum election victory a party must record or percentage of votes it must poll to sustain its status as a registered political party.\n\nIn another case by some other deregistered parties, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, ordered the commission to re-list 22 of the political parties deregistered for failing to win any elective office in the 2019 general election.\n\nThe court made the order shortly after setting aside a judgment of the Federal High Court, which upheld the power of INEC to deregister political parties.\n\nJustice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, in a judgment delivered on June 11, 2020 had dismissed the suit of the 22 appellants challenging the power of INEC to deregister them.\n\nReacting to yesterday\u2019s ruling, the President of the Inter Party Advisory Council, Dr. Leonard Nzenwa hailed the judgment, saying it had ended all speculations and that \u201cthis will aid INEC to now focus on critical issues in preparation for delivering credible, free and fair 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomole, has described the call for military takeover of a democratically elected government as irresponsible and senseless.\n\nOshiomhole\u2019s reaction followed a recent call by legal luminary, Chief Roberts Clarke, in an interview on television, for military intervention in governance in order to fix the country\u2019s festering security challenges and to carry out restructuring of the country.\n\nThe former national Chairman of APC spoke yesterday in Abuja when the leadership of the Law Students Association of Nigeria (LAWSON), paid him a courtesy visit, during which they invited him to their forthcoming National Conference on Rule of Law.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI watched on a national television one of your very senior colleagues, Chief Robert Clarke, I was shocked when I saw him calling on the President to handover to the military.\n\n\u201cI thought that was the height of irresponsibility, given his knowledge, given his age and a very senior member of the bar and, what is it that he wanted? He wants a military that will restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is again for me senseless, because the structure as it is today, who put it in place? Who overthrew the parliamentary system?\u201d\n\nThe former Edo State Governor was of the opinion that the first thing that suffers under the military is the rule of law, adding that for anyone who is familiar with the military system, like Clarke, should tender apology to Nigerians.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe parliamentary system was overthrown by the Nigerian military. That is on record. Who created 12 states from the four regions by decree? It was the military. The current 36 states and FCT; who created them by military decree? It was the military. How can anybody who has lived through and who is familiar with our journey as a nation think that the solution to our problems as a nation is to handover to the military? I think, talking about the rule of law, that is treason.\n\n\u201cYou know we have freedom of speech but it does not include the freedom to canvass unlawful means to effect a change. When you canvas unlawful means, then you should be arraigned before a court of law and dealt with according to the law. Ignorance is not even an excuse in law, not to talk of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOshiomhole called on Nigerians to have faith in the country in spite of the challenges, while urging everyone not to give up.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that even in our moment of distress and regardless of what anybody thinks, the world has resolved and Nigeria is part of it, that never again shall we be governed by an unelected government, never, we don\u2019t want unelected Angels.\u201d\n\nOn the agitation for separation, the APC chieftain described those agitating for secession as \u201cpoor students of history\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am also not agreeing with those who think of dis-membering Nigeria. They say let everybody go his way. Nigeria is not a reality. Those ones are poor students of history.\n\n\u201cWhy is Europe spending so much time forming the European Union to create a larger market? Recently, we signed the African Trade Agreement so that Nigeria can access a bigger market. We already have a local market of 200 million. If we can keep it flourishing and increase the purchasing power of the citizens, we already have a huge market. That should be an asset.

          "text": "\u2022Raised red flags snubbed by US bank\u2019s management\n\nFestus Akanbi and Emmanuel Addeh, with agency report\n\nFresh documents on the long-standing legal dispute between the federal government and Malabu Oil have shown that JP Morgan, the American bank in the middle of the alleged scandal, was alerted by its internal control team that the $875 million transfers to former petroleum minister Dan Etete, for the sale of OPL 245, were questionable.\n\nEtete, who was minister under the Sani Abacha regime, has been in the eye of the storm concerning the sale of the oil block which triggered a number of court cases in Nigeria and in Europe.\n\nA report yesterday by Bloomberg indicated that JPMorgan Chase & Co. was warned by its compliance team over the \u201cgreat risk\u201d of corruption just days before it made the last of three transfers that totalled $875 million to Etete.\n\nThe federal government, in a London lawsuit, is pushing that the internal memo sent by the compliance unit to the bank\u2019s managers should be scrutinised.\n\nThe U.S. bank is accused of ignoring the red flags when it transferred funds between 2011 and 2013 to Dan Etete, whose private jet was seized by the Buhari government.\n\nThe memo disclosed at a London court hearing last Wednesday showed what JPMorgan managers knew about the oil contract and when, lawyers for the Nigerian government said in court documents. A spokesperson for the investment bank declined to comment.\n\nAccording to court documents, by 2013, JPMorgan\u2019s internal concerns over payments to Malabu Oil and Gas were escalated to more senior members of the bank.\n\n\u201cIn light of Malabu\u2019s reported connection to the alleged Nigerian corruption scheme, there would be great risk presented if JPMC continues to process wires involving Malabu,\u201d a compliance officer based in the United States wrote in a memo dated Aug. 23, 2013 and quoted by Bloomberg.\n\nJust six days later, JPMorgan made a payment of $75.2 million to the Malabu account, according to the report.\n\nLawyers for the federal government said in court last Wednesday that they wanted to know how the memo was compiled and asked a judge for more emails and documents from the compliance team.\n\nThe lawyers are seeking details of how the US bank\u2019s compliance team monitored and placed controls over questionable payments including a so-called \u201cinterdiction list\u201d, a tool to prevent transfers from being automatically cleared. Malabu was placed on the list in November 2013.\n\nThe federal government had alleged that most of the $1.3 billion purchase price for the licence for the offshore oilfield known as OPL 245 was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen under previous administrations.\n\nIn 1998, the government awarded OPL 245 for $20 million to Malabu Oil and Gas, which was later found to be owned by Dan Etete, who was oil minister at the time, in collaboration with people close to former military ruler, Sani Abacha.\n\nThree years later, in July 2001, the then government under President Olusegun Obasanjo revoked OPL 245 licence, triggering legal disputes over its ownership that dragged on for years.\n\nBy 2006, Malabu reached a settlement with the federal government, agreeing to pay $218 million to Nigeria in return for the licence being fully reinstated, after it was given to Shell, which subsequently failed to pay.\n\nThe case became even more complex when Mohammed Abacha, son of the former ruler, launched a legal challenge arguing that Etete pushed him out of his partial ownership of Malabu.\n\nIn 2011, Malabu agreed to hand OPL 245 back to the government for $1.092 billion. In parallel, Shell and Eni agreed to pay the government $1.092 billion plus a signature bonus of $208 million, taking their payment for OPL 245 to $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the same year, $1.092 billion was placed in an escrow account opened by the Nigerian government with U.S. bank JP Morgan, from which $875 million was transferred to bank accounts in the name of Malabu.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria filed a case at a London High Court against the bank alleging negligence for its role in transferring the $875 million to Etete\u2019s Malabu, an allegation JP Morgan said it considered \u201cunsubstantiated and without merit\u201d.\n\nIn 2019, a Nigerian judge issued arrest warrants for Dan Etete, and an Eni manager over the sale of the oilfield.\n\nEuropean and Nigerian courts have been raking over the purchase by Eni SpA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc of the oil license in Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, a decade ago.\n\nWhile the energy giants were recently acquitted of corruption charges in Milan, in a decision prosecutors could appeal, Nigeria\u2019s government is continuing to seek compensation from JPMorgan.\n\nThe Buhari administration claims Etete distributed a portion of the funds received via the bank from the oil majors to corrupt former and serving senior public officials.\n\nThe bank has denied any wrongdoing and says it is being held responsible for not protecting the Nigerian people from their own government.\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s oil minister in the last weeks of the corrupt Abacha military regime in 1998, Etete was said to have effectively awarded the prospecting rights of the huge OPL 245 block to the company he secretly controlled.\n\nAfter Abacha\u2019s sudden death, Etete retained the rights as a private citizen until he offloaded them to oil giants Shell and Eni in 2011, and they paid a combined $1.3 billion to the federal government.\n\nThe entire OPL245 deal was a subject of a corruption trial in Italy, where Etete was an accused, together with alleged middlemen, Eni and Shell, and several of their executives. The court recently acquitted the international oil executives.\n\nThe Nigerian authorities had also charged Etete and several others linked to Malabu with money laundering in connection with the onward flow of funds from the OPL245 deal.\n\nHe has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the allegations as \u201cpolitical propaganda.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved the use of Sinopharm, the COVID-19 vaccine produced in China, for emergency use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinopharm is the sixth vaccine approved by the WHO against COVID-19 \u2014 Pfizer/BioNTech, Astrazeneca-SK Bio, Serum Institute of India, Janssen and Moderna vaccines are five others listed by the WHO for emergency use.\n\nAnnouncing the approval via a statement on Friday, the WHO said the decision was part of efforts to improve access to vaccines to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the global health organisation, the emergency use listing (EUL) will also provide more options for countries interested in accessing vaccines via the United Nations-led COVAX facility \u2014 African countries are procuring vaccines via the COVAX facility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria has also expressed interest in procuring COVID-19 vaccine from China \u2014 although the AstraZeneca vaccine is what is currently being distributed in the country.\n\n\u201cWHO today listed the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving the green light for this vaccine to be rolled out globally. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary of China National Biotec Group (CNBG),\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the case of the Sinopharm vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility. The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings. It is the also first vaccine that will carry a vaccine vial monitor, a small sticker on the vaccine vials that change color as the vaccine is exposed to heat, letting health workers know whether the vaccine can be safely used.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined.\n\n\u201cFew older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because preliminary data and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.\n\n\u201cThere is no theoretical reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO therefore recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to make the recommendation more robust.\u201d",

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Introduced as Tip Jar on Twitter\u2019s blog post, the feature is still only available to a limited group of people who use Twitter in English.\n\nToday we\u2019re introducing Tip Jar, a new way for people to send and receive tips. \ud83e\uddf5 https://t.co/UcPV27oHR1 \u2014 Esther Crawford (@esthercrawford) May 6, 2021\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Tip Jar-enabled account will have a \u201ccash icon\u201d next to the follow button on the profile page. Enabled users can then pick one of the payments services offered.\n\nCurrently, the new feature supports Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo. Android users can also send payments through the recently expanded Spaces announced on Twitter\u2019s blog.\n\nAccording to the blog post, \u201cTip Jar is an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation on Twitter. This is a first step in our work to create new ways for people to receive and show support on Twitter \u2013 with money.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the platform has been devising ways to generate revenue following a $260 million drop from its revenue in Q4 2020. In the platform\u2019s Q4 2020 report, it reported revenue of $1.3 billion. In Q1 2021, the report read a total revenue of $1.04 billion.\n\nWhile the Tip Jar feature is to show support on Twitter, it might eventually be a source of revenue for Twitter\n\nIn February, we predicted that Twitter would explore a tipping feature among other non-ad related prospects to increase revenue. At the moment, the platform has introduced other features such as Super Follows and might introduce Undo Tweets.\n\nThough Twitter isn\u2019t taking any cut from Tip Jar now, it is likely to do so when the feature is available to more people.\n\nWhile some users like Austin Rief, Morning Brew CEO, are excited about the feature, some privacy issues have been raised. Rachel Tobac, a user who tested the feature, tweeted that the PayPal receipt contained the sender\u2019s address. However, Twitter support has taken action on the issue in a tweet that read, \u201cWe\u2019re updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.\u201d\n\nLimited to only journalists, creators, experts, and non-profits, Twitter promises that more people will be able to add Tip Jar to their profiles.\n\nHowever, it is not clear the criteria Twitter will use to identify users with access to the feature. Perhaps the feature will only be available to verified or paid subscribers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAre you building a startup business within Port Harcourt but struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

Introduced as Tip Jar on Twitter\u2019s blog post, the feature is still only available to a limited group of people who use Twitter in English.\n\nToday we\u2019re introducing Tip Jar, a new way for people to send and receive tips. \ud83e\uddf5 https://t.co/UcPV27oHR1 \u2014 Esther Crawford (@esthercrawford) May 6, 2021\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Tip Jar-enabled account will have a \u201ccash icon\u201d next to the follow button on the profile page. Enabled users can then pick one of the payments services offered.\n\nCurrently, the new feature supports Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo. Android users can also send payments through the recently expanded Spaces announced on Twitter\u2019s blog.\n\nAccording to the blog post, \u201cTip Jar is an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation on Twitter. This is a first step in our work to create new ways for people to receive and show support on Twitter \u2013 with money.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the platform has been devising ways to generate revenue following a $260 million drop from its revenue in Q4 2020. In the platform\u2019s Q4 2020 report, it reported revenue of $1.3 billion. In Q1 2021, the report read a total revenue of $1.04 billion.\n\nWhile the Tip Jar feature is to show support on Twitter, it might eventually be a source of revenue for Twitter\n\nIn February, we predicted that Twitter would explore a tipping feature among other non-ad related prospects to increase revenue. At the moment, the platform has introduced other features such as Super Follows and might introduce Undo Tweets.\n\nThough Twitter isn\u2019t taking any cut from Tip Jar now, it is likely to do so when the feature is available to more people.\n\nWhile some users like Austin Rief, Morning Brew CEO, are excited about the feature, some privacy issues have been raised. Rachel Tobac, a user who tested the feature, tweeted that the PayPal receipt contained the sender\u2019s address. However, Twitter support has taken action on the issue in a tweet that read, \u201cWe\u2019re updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.\u201d\n\nLimited to only journalists, creators, experts, and non-profits, Twitter promises that more people will be able to add Tip Jar to their profiles.\n\nHowever, it is not clear the criteria Twitter will use to identify users with access to the feature. Perhaps the feature will only be available to verified or paid subscribers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nAre you building a startup business within Port Harcourt but struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari, has launched a policy that may see Nigerian startups enjoy more government ICT contracts.\n\nOn Thursday, May 6, 2021, the Nigerian Federal Government officially launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector. It also launched the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration.\n\nThe launch of the Revised National Digital Identity Policy for SIM Card Registration reiterated the mandatory use of NIN for all sim registration\n\nThe National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector is in line with the eighth pillar in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) Document unveiled in November 2019 by the President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eighth pillar, titled \u201cIndigenous Content Development and Adoption\u201d, is to provide a policy framework to identify jobs that are currently being outsourced and support the repatriation of these jobs to digitally skilled Nigerians.\n\nOne of the implementation strategies of the pillar states that the government will increase the patronage of digital startups, enabling them to access a minimum percentage of government-funded jobs.\n\nAs we noted earlier, the Nigerian government is not known to give its ICT contracts to Nigerian startups. A notice on the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) website in 2017 called for interested bidders to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to build a secure e-ticketing system on an investment basis.\n\nOne of the eligibility criteria listed on the notice mandates companies to have \u201cverifiable evidence of financial capability with an average annual turnover of not less than \u20a61 billion ($2.8 million) in the last three years (2014, 2015, and 2016).\u201d A most unrealistic criterion likely to marginalise small Nigerian startups and ICT companies.\n\nA more recent example is the Lagos unified Internet Fibre Infrastructure Project begun in 2020. Local Industry experts revealed that details of the project were unclear regarding the future of fibre infrastructure in Lagos State.\n\nHowever, as we reported in 2020, the Ekiti State Government partnered with on-demand mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), to digitise operations of commercial motorcycles (Okada) and tricycles (Keke). The startup was to introduce digital technology to aid the project.\n\nWhile the new policy might pave the way for government patronage of Nigerian startups, it remains to be seen, given history, how well the policy would be implemented.

I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies.

I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has emphasised that in light of disruption in the technology world, it is keen on balancing healthy competition with entry of disruptive technologies to ensure sustainable telecoms industry growth and development in Nigeria.\n\nThe Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of NCC, Umar Danbatta, stated this during a presentation to the commission by a delegation from SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportations services company, in Abuja on Thursday, May 6, 2021.\n\nSpaceX is in the process of launching a low-earth orbiting (LOE) constellation of satellites to provide low latency, high bandwidths Internet to all corners of the globe and has identified Nigeria as a critical market.\n\nSpaceX has been in discussion with NCC virtually over the past several months to begin the process of pursuing all necessary licenses to bring Starlink, its satellite-based broadband services to Nigeria.\n\nHaving made substantial progress in the discussion, the Commission granted SpaceX\u2019s request for a face-to-face discussion to gain better insights on the prospects of their proposal.\n\nLed by SpaceX\u2019s Starlink Market Access Director for Africa, Ryan Goodnight and supported by the company\u2019s consultant, Levin Born, the company provided an overview of its plans, expectations, licensing requests and deployment phases during the meeting.\n\nAfter the presentation by SpaceX team, the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, Ubale Maska, who stood in for the EVC, said NCC will work on necessary modalities to ensure that it balances the need for healthy competition vis-a-vis the entry of new technologies, in order to protect all industry stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs the regulator of a highly dynamic sector in Nigeria, the Commission is conscious of the need to ensure that our regulatory actions are anchored on national interest. We have listened to your presentation and we will review it vis-\u00e0-vis our regulatory direction of ensuring effective and a sustainable telecoms ecosystem where a licensee\u2019s operational model does not dampen healthy competition among other licensees,\u201d Mr Maska told the SpaceX delegation.\n\nMr Maska further stated that the commission is interested in making necessary regulatory efforts to drive the coverage of rural, unserved and underserved areas of the country through the accomplishments of the lofty targets contained in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025. He noted that the plan\u2019s target of 70 per cent broadband penetration target, covering 90 per cent of the population by 2025, is also in line with government expectations in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2010-2030.\n\nOther senior management staff of the commission at the briefing include the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management, Adeleke Adewolu; Director, Licensing and Authorisation, Mohammed Babajika; Director, Technical Standards and Network Integrity, Bako Wakil; Director, New Media and Information Security, Haru Alhassan and Director, Spectrum Administration, Oluwatoyin Asaju, among others.\n\nSection 70 (2) of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003, empowers the Commission to regulate the provision and use of all satellite communications services and networks, in whole or in part within Nigeria or on a ship or aircraft registered in Nigeria.\n\nThis is for the purpose of ensuring a well-developed and organised satellite communications market with appropriate legal framework that meets international best practices, encourages innovation, promotes competition and guarantees public safety in the rendering of commercial satellite services.",

          "title": "Cement prices hit N4500 in Nigeria\u2019s SouthEast",
          "text": "A market survey in the region shows that block makers are shutting down\n\nBy Our Reporters\n\nCement prices have increased by 67-100 per cent in the South East states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo, hitting as high as N4,500 in Abakaliki.\n\nA market survey conducted by NAN at various wholesale and retail shops in the zone shows that the price of the product has increased almost by 100 % when compared to the price in 2020.\n\nA cement dealer at Kenyatta Market in Enugu State capital, Mr Ifeanyi Amadi said the increase in the product\u2019s price started last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increase in dollar exchange.\n\nHe noted that a trailer load of Dangote cement with 600 bags initially sold at N1.5 million in 2020 but is now N2.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother retailer at Uwani, Samuel Uwakwe, said he was surprised at the rate prices of the product in the country.\n\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\n\nUwakwe lamented that few individuals were given opportunity to supply the product and pleaded with suppliers to reduce the prices and make it available for the citizens.\n\nHe maintained that the prices would likely crash during raining season.\n\nA block maker, Mr Albert Okechukwu noted that increase in the price of the product affected his business as he still sold six-inch and nine-inch block at N170 and N180 respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is the same price we sold last year and it is same till date because we cannot change prices in order to retain our customers but most block industries have reduced quality of their blocks,\u201d he said.\n\nA site Engineer, Mr Emma Ugwuoke said he wanted to start a building in the village when the price was N2,800 last year but was waiting to see if it would come down.\n\n\u201cWhen I went back next time, I was told it was N3, 000 and to my greatest surprise, they sell N3,900 and N4,000 now in my village.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing one can do than to buy it like that. I want government to do something urgently about it because it is frustrating buying cement at that price,\u201d Ugwuoke said.\n\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\n\nThose who spoke to NAN said the price hike had further dashed the hope of many Nigerians, wishing to own their personal homes.\n\nA businessman, Mr Victor Ugwu, said he had to suspend his building project because of the \u201cunfortunate development\u201d.\n\nUgwu said: \u201cI have stopped my project for now. I cannot afford to continue with the current price of the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe economy is very bad so I hope to wait until there is a drop in the price.\n\n\u201cI think the hike can be attributed to the monopoly being enjoyed by the cement producers in the country. Unfortunately, there may not be any respite until that monopoly is broken.\u201d\n\nHowever, a cement dealer, Mr James Ogbonna, said the problem had nothing to do with the manufacturers of the commodity.\n\nRather, Ogbonna blamed the price hike on the activities of \u201cshylock distributors\u201d of cement.\n\nHe said that the hike had affected his business adversely, adding that cement patronage had been at the lowest ebb, since the price hike.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first and second week of March, we sold a bag for N3,200, but within the third week we started selling at N3,500.\n\n\u201cBy the end of March, the price moved up to N4,000 and now, we sell between N4,000 and N4100, depending on the brand.\u201d\n\nAnother dealer, Mr Godwin Okafor, said that his sales had dropped drastically as a result of the hike.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of challenges in this cement business now. When we make deposit and order for the goods, it takes about one month before we get delivery,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a similar situation in Awka in Anambra as stakeholders decry the situation.\n\nMr Kenechukwu Okoye, a cement dealer along Zik Avenue, Awka said before the #EndSARS protest in 2020, a 50kg bag of cement was sold at N2,500.\n\n\u201cShortly after the #EndSARS, the price rose to N3,000 and from there to the present price of N4,000 and N4,100, we are selling today,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye said though the distributors initially blamed the problem on difficulties encountered by the hauling firm transporting the product, the situation had come to stay.\n\nIn Owerri, Imo capital, price of cement is between N3,850 and N4300, depending on the brand.\n\nAt the Building Materials Market in Naze, Owerri North Local Government Area, Dangote and BUA cement are sold at N4,000 per bag while BUA and UNICEM are sold for N3,900.\n\nMr Okechukwu Okonya, a seller, said the cost could be attributed to high cost of transportation as a result of fuel price.\n\nOkonya also said major dealers sometimes hoard the product in their warehouses to create artificial scarcity.\n\nAnother trader, Mr Marcel Iwu, agreed that although there had been hoarding by major dealers, manufacturers had also complained of increased cost of raw materials.\n\nIwu added that the prices could go higher or reduce at any given time, noting that even if prices fall, traders would want to sell off their old stock at higher rates.\n\nIn Abakaliki, Ebonyi, prices of almost all building materials have gone up.\n\nThe prices of cement, rods of various sizes, corrugated roofing sheets and other building materials and accessories according to NAN findings have been on the increase since January.\n\nThe price of Dangote and Bua which sold at N2,500 earlier in November and December 2020 now sold between N4000 and N4500.\n\nSimilarly, Unicem cement which also sold at N2,300 within the same period had also gone up to N4,000 and N4,300.\n\nMr John Okoh, a cement dealer at Kpiri-Kpiri market in an interview with NAN attributed the development to lack of price control mechanism and high rate of exchange rate of the Naira against the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe development is indeed affecting sales and business because many builders have put a stop to their building and other construction projects because they cannot cope with the present high cost of the product.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Clement Igbo, who owns a block moulding factory, said that the high cost of cement was hampering production, saying that he no longer produced maximally due to lack of buyers.\n\n\u201cA bag of Dangote cement which is one of the best products for our business is selling for N4500 and it is difficult to buy at this prevailing price and make enough production.\n\n\u201cWe sell six inch and nine-inch block before this price increase at N150 and N200 but now 6 inch-block is sold at N220 while the 9-inch sells for between N250 and N300 respectively.\n\n\u201cMany block industries in the town have closed down production while some have compromised standard which pose great dangers to the building industry,\u201d Igbo said.\n\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\nMr Jerry Onwe, an economic activist urged the Federal and state governments to revive moribund cement factories across the states to meet the increasing demands of cement consumption in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the quest for mass housing for poor Nigerians would remain elusive if urgent steps were not taken to address the high cost of building materials in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn a nation where an average worker earns N30,000 monthly as take-home wage, how can such a person afford a house of his own in view of the prevailing price of building materials?\n\n\u201cWe have reached a cross road as far as the issue of building materials is concerned and this is a time for government to intervene and bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",
          "summary": "\u201cThe prices change on daily basis, so as we are talking now, I cannot guarantee the prices it will be sold tomorrow,\u201d he said.\nAccording to him, a bag of Dangote Cement is sold at N3,900, Unicem for N3,700; Bua Cement for N3,700 and Kogi Super Cement is sold at N3,600.\nIn Abia, a cross-section of residents of Umuahia, the state capital, also decried the high price of cement, which ranges from N4,000 to N4,100 per 50kg bag.\nHe expressed fears that the high cost of cement which had led to improper \u2018mixture\u2019 of concretes for building purpose might affect quality and standard of buildings.\n\u201cThe Nkalagu Cement Factory in Ebonyi is capable of supply the cement needs of the entire South-East if properly revived,\u201d Onwe said",

          "text": "Facts have emerged on why the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority, Hadiza Bala Usman, was suspended.\n\nShe was accused of inability to give of the yearly remittance of operating surpluses by the NPA from from2016 to 2020\n\nAccording to Rotimi Amaechi, details she gave was \u201cfar short of the amount due for actual remittance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Amaechi letted to President Muhammadu Buhari, NPA within the stipulated years, recorded an outstanding unremitted balance of N165 billion (N165, 320, 962, 697).\n\nHe therefore suggested that the financial account of the NPA be investigated and audited. As such, Ms Usman was suspended.\n\nDocuments obtained by NEWS DIRECT revealed the correspondence between Mr Amaechi and Ibrahim Gambari, Mr Buhari\u2019s spokesperson who confirmed the president approval. The ministry in its letter signed by Magdalene Ajani, the Permanent Secretary, listed five audit firms and requested the Auditor-General\u2019s office to approve any of them for the audit. In the alternative, the ministry requested the Auditor-General\u2019s Office to grant it authority to advertise and select qualified audit firms to conduct the exercise.\n\nThe audit firms listed by the ministry include KPMG Nigeria, Deloitte Nigeria, Price Water House Coopers (PwC), Ernest and Young Nigeria, and McKinsey and Company.\n\nBut the Auditor-General, Adolphus Aghughu, in a letter dated April 16, notified the transport ministry that the NPA board had engaged Messrs Muhtari Dangana & Co (Chartered Accountants) and SIAO Chartered Accountants as external audit firms.\n\nIn the letter which he personally signed, the AG added that the said audit firms had indeed audited and published the accounts of NPA in 2016, 2017, and 2018 financial years, and the 2019 audit is ongoing. The Auditor-General added that its office had conducted periodic checks and released appropriate reports on the checks.\n\nQuoting extant laws establishing the NPA and the Nigerian constitution, the Auditor-General concluded that \u201creputable professional audit firms are already being engaged by the Board in line with the enabling Act\u201d. It added that there was \u201cno justification for the Ministry to advertise and select qualified Audit firms to conduct the exercise.\u201d",

I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles.\n\n\u201cI said shoot anyone found illegally with an AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped.\n\n\u201cPeople must show consideration for their own country,\u201d said the President while speaking on the security challenges, which PEAC said was having great repercussions on the economy.\n\nPresident Buhari, who charged leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noted that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nThe President promised that the federal government would focus on greater development of irrigation facilities in the country, and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nHe said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome the economic challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources; gas, vast arable land, which we are not using enough,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President was reacting to disclosure by Prof Salami, in his presentation, that only 2% of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives were needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nPEAC submitted that the global economy had continued to improve as COVID infections drop and the roll-out of vaccination intensified.\n\nThe council added that the Nigerian economy remained fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are; decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as a basis for revitalizing the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation, and incentives for private investment in irrigation to promote all-year-round farming.",

We shall certainly and aggressively pursue those people that are involved in terrorist financing as far as the Nigerian state is concerned,\u201d he declared.\n\nNigeria has been grappling with series of security challenges ranging from Boko Haram terrorism in the northeast to banditry in the northwest, kidnapping for ransom in several parts of the country, ritual, agitations for secession among several others.\n\nThe country has been battling insurgency for over a decade with over 36,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in the northeast.\n\nAs part of measures to rejig the entire security architecture, President Muhammadu Buhari earlier this year replaced his four top military commanders in a bid to better combat the insurgency that has also displaced more than two million people from their homes since 2009.\n\nISWAP split from mainstream Boko Haram in 2016 and became a dominant group, launching attacks on military bases and ambushing troops while abducting travellers at fake checkpoints.\n\nSince 2019, the army has mostly withdrawn from villages and smaller bases into so-called \u201csuper camps\u201d, fortified garrisons meant to give better protection against attacks.\n\nBut critics say the strategy has left jihadists with more freedom to roam untouched in rural areas and made highways vulnerable to kidnappings and assaults.",

I told him to sell the fuel, sell the trucks, and put the money in the treasury\u201d.\n\nThe President stated this on Friday, during the 6th regular meeting with the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC), led by Professor Doyin Salami in Abuja.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Begins Profiling Of Nigerians Linked To Terrorism Financing\n\nPresident Buhari charged the leadership at every level to go back to the basics, noting that a bottom-up approach was necessary, from ward to local council, states, and federal.\n\nHe decried the situation in which some unscrupulous people tried to undermine every policy of the government, irrespective of the good it was meant to achieve for the country.\n\n\u201cThey still brought arms and ammunition into the country, brought in rice in vehicles and motorcycles. I said shoot anyone found illegally with AK-47, yet they haven\u2019t stopped. People must show consideration for their own country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari pledged that the Federal Government will focus on the greater development of irrigation facilities in the country, and encourage more people into agriculture.\n\nHe said agriculture was a good way for the country to overcome economic challenges confronting it, stressing: \u201cWe need to go back to the land. Technology is doing away with petroleum, but we are lucky we have other resources; Gas, vast arable land, which we are not using enough.\u201d\n\nThe President responding to disclosure by Prof Salami, in his presentation, that only 2% of land under cultivation is irrigated, recommending that apart from government efforts, incentives are needed for private people to enter the sector.\n\nPEAC submitted that the global economy has continued to improve as COVID infections drop and the roll-out of vaccination intensifies, adding that the Nigerian economy, though out of recession, remains fragile with inflation rising, unemployment high, and external account weak.\n\nPolicy, the economic advisory body said, \u201cmust urgently address the challenges of rising prices.\u201d\n\nAmong other issues recommended by PEAC are; decisive end to all forms of insecurity in the country, mobilization of resources for investment, hastened implementation of agricultural reform policies, the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as a basis for revitalizing the industry, poverty reduction, employment generation, and incentives for private investment in irrigation, to promote all-year-round farming.",

We are very open to hosting the final round.\u201d\n\nBritain has been one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic, but is currently easing restrictions following a sharp decline in cases and deaths.\n\nBut Public Health England announced Friday it had named a strain of the virus from India as a \u201cVariant of Concern\u201d after cases rose over the previous week to 520 from 202.\n\nMost cases were clustered in Bolton, northwest England, and London, with almost half linked to foreign travel.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Four Ex-Police Officers Charged with Violating Civil Rights in George Floyd Death \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "A federal grand jury indicted four former Minneapolis police officers on charges they violated George Floyd\u2019s civil rights, according to a three-count indictment unsealed on Friday.\n\nFloyd was killed on May 25, 2020, when former officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on the Black man\u2019s back for more than nine minutes. A jury found Chauvin guilty of three counts of unintentional murder and manslaughter in April. Chauvin has appealed and asked for a new trial.\n\nThe third count of the civil rights indictment claims that Chauvin, along with the three officers who were present as Floyd died; Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, \u201cwillfully deprived\u201d Floyd of the civil right guaranteed by the US Constitution \u201cnot to be deprived of liberty without due process of law\u201d.\n\nChauvin is charged with violating Floyd\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and unreasonable force by a police officer. Chauvin was also charged in a second indictment, stemming from the arrest and neck restraint of a 14-year-old boy in 2017.\n\nThao and Kueng are also charged with violating Floyd\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable seizure, alleging they did not intervene to stop Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck. All four officers are charged for their failure to provide Floyd with medical care.\n\nTo bring federal charges in deaths involving police, prosecutors must believe that an officer acted under the \u201ccolor of law,\u201d or government authority, and willfully deprived someone of their constitutional rights, including the right to be free from unreasonable seizures or the use of unreasonable force.\n\nThat is a high legal standard; an accident, bad judgement or simple negligence on the officer\u2019s part is not enough to support federal charges.\n\nChauvin\u2019s guilty verdict gave hope to police reform activists that the US was turning the page on what they view as impunity for killer cops.\n\nChauvin filed a request for a new trial earlier this week, citing the media frenzy surrounding his trial.",

          "text": "The World Health Organization has approved the emergency use of a Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by China\u2019s Sinopharm.\n\nFriday\u2019s decision by a WHO technical advisory group, a first for a Chinese vaccine, opens the possibility that Sinopharm\u2019s offering could be included in the United Nations-backed COVAX programme in coming weeks or months, and distributed through United Nations children\u2019s agency UNICEF and WHO\u2019s Americas regional office.\n\nAside from efficacy numbers, the Chinese manufacturer has released very little public data about its two vaccines \u2013 one developed by its Beijing Institute of Biological Products and the other by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.\n\nThe Beijing-made Sinopharm shot is one the WHO advisory group considered for the emergency use listing.\n\n\u201cThis afternoon, WHO gave emergency use listing to sign off on Beijing\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy and quality,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhahom Ghebreyesus said.\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine will join ones made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and a version of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, in receiving the coveted authorisation from the UN health agency.\n\n\u201cThis expands the list of vaccines that COVAX can buy and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval and to import and administer a vaccine,\u201d Tedros said at a Geneva news conference.\n\nSinopharm has not published its late-stage test results in scientific journals, so the WHO requested a breakdown of its data, which come mostly from the United Arab Emirates.\n\nA summary posted online by WHO suggests the vaccine is about 78 percent effective, with the caveat that all but a few hundred of the study volunteers were younger than 60.\n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which co-runs COVAX, welcomed WHO\u2019s approval of emergency use.\n\n\u201cThis means the world has yet another safe and effective tool in the fight against this pandemic,\u201d the alliance said.",

          "text": "The Maldives police have said an explosion that wounded former President Mohamed Nasheed was an act of terrorism but no suspects were identified.\n\nNasheed, the former president and current speaker of parliament, remains in hospital after a bomb attack that left him with serious shrapnel wounds and the Indian Ocean archipelago in shock.\n\nThe 53-year-old had just left his house in the capital, Male, and was about to get into his car late on Thursday when a bomb attached to a motorbike exploded. Residents said the blast was heard across the city.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nHome Minister Imran Abdulla told local media Nasheed\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening. One of Nasheed\u2019s bodyguards was also taken to hospital.\n\nPresident Ibrahim Mohamed Solih went to the hospital where Nasheed, a close ally, is being treated and called an emergency meeting following the attack.\n\nSolih said on Friday the explosion was \u201can attack on democracy\u201d and the Maldives\u2019 tourism-dependent economy, and announced that Australian federal police investigators will arrive on Saturday to assist an investigation.\n\n\u201cNasheed escaped an assassination attempt,\u201d a Maldivian government official told AFP news agency. \u201cHe is injured, but his condition is stable.\u201d\n\nImages on social media showed a destroyed motorbike at the scene of the attack, which was cordoned off by armed police units and security forces.\n\nNasheed has been an outspoken critic of religious extremism in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation, where preaching and practicing other faiths are banned by law.\n\nThe Maldives is known for its luxury resorts but has seen rare violent attacks. In 2007, a blast in a park in the capital wounded 12 foreign tourists.\n\nViolence has been blamed on a rise in religious extremism. The Maldives has one of the highest per capita numbers of militants who fought in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSolih said in a televised speech that Australian Federal Police investigators will arrive on Saturday. The Australian Federal Police said its members will engage with Maldives police and assess the assistance that can be provided to their investigation.",
