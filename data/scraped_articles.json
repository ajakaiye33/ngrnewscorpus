          "title": "S\u2019West PDP: Reconcile with Fayose, Olafeso, Olopoeyan tells Arapaja",
          "text": "One of the aggrieved leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party in Oyo State, Alhaji Adebisi Olopoeyan, has urged the National Vice Chairman of the PDP, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja, to reconcile with a former Ekiti State governor, Ayo Fayose, and a former South-West PDP chairman, Dr Eddy Olafeso.\n\nOlopoeyan, who together with Fayose supported Olafeso against Arapaja at a recent congress held in Osogbo, spoke at his residence in Ibadan on Saturday when the PDP vice chairman visited him.\n\nThe visit came 48 hours after Olafeso visited Olopoeyan at his residence to celebrate Eid el-Fitr with him.\n\nOlopoeyan urged Arapaja to reconcile with Fayose and Olafeso, and other aggrieved chieftains, to make the party stronger.\n\nHe said, \u201cYour coming here to my home is personal. We have a very good political relationship, and to date, nobody, Seyi Makinde (Oyo State Governor) included, can disrupt our relationship. My not supporting you for the South-West PDP chairmanship was that you came into the field late and you also failed to seek my support.\n\n\u201cChief Olafeso sought my support with everything and I gave him my support wholeheartedly without regrets. On the rift between Seyi Makinde and me, only the governor and I could sit together and resolve it.\n\n\u201cI was the one who convinced Makinde to return to the PDP. I was the facilitator of how PDP leaders accepted his governorship ambition. Therefore, only the governor and I can sit together and resolve the issue Makinde intentionally created.\n\n\u201cMost annoying is the local government election that should have been the fulcrum on which the settlement with the aggrieved leaders is placed. How I wish you, Arapaja, could prevail on Mr Governor to postpone the local government election for the governor to meet first with many of the aggrieved leaders.\u201d\n\nArapaja promised to take action on the issues raised by Olopoeyan.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all shouldn\u2019t allow them to use us against ourselves. We shouldn\u2019t for any reason give room for the lapses that happened in 2011 to repeat themselves because, in the end, we would be at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pertinent for all hands to be on deck. This party belongs to us all. We can\u2019t afford to lose this state again, and apart from that, we all need to work together to achieve greatness for the region. We need to get back to having more states in the zone.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Imo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, on Saturday, ordered police officers in the state to increase their firepower against bandits in the state.\n\nThe police boss, who spoke while launching the Operation Search and Flush of the command, charged the officers to strive to win every gun duel with the enemies of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cImprove and increase your firepower. If you have a problem with your shooting ability and efficiency, indicate now so that we will take you to a CSP (Chief Superintendent of Police) who has been sent from the IGP (Inspector General of Police) from Abuja. He will put you through so that you will become as efficient as you should be.\n\n\u201cI need results that I can be proud to report to the IGP and the governor, who is the Chief Security Officer of the state. You must understand that it is no longer business as usual. You should be able to demobilise them, take their armoury to improve our own armoury. Not the other way around.\u201d\n\nYaro said he would not tolerate any form of professional misconduct from any police officer.\n\nThe CP said, \u201cYou must put in your best. For now, you are on secondment to the office of the Commissioner of Police. Remember, there will be no police without the people. You must therefore put in your best in terms of precision, professionalism and commitment in making sure that the enemies of the state are defeated.\n\n\u201cLet me warn you that I will not fail to invoke the appropriate police code in disciplining any erring officer. I need nothing but the best. I need results. My phone numbers are everywhere. If I get a complaint that you are extorting or engaging in any unprofessional conduct, I will not fail to invoke the appropriate sanctions against you.\n\n\u201cAs your Commissioner of Police, I have a right of supervision over you and your conduct. I need a new spirit of achievement. You must be result-oriented and driven. Go and recover more arms from the bandits. We must neutralise the bandits and add their armoury to our own. You must maintain visibility and presence in Imo. I want operational patrol and not ceremonial patrol.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

As we recover and rebuild from COVID-19, let\u2019s make safer roads for a safer world.\u201d\n\nThe statement also quoted Zoleka Mandela, Global Ambassador for the Child Health Initiative, as saying, \u201cso many of us around the world are taking to the streets and demanding change.\n\n\u201cWe want low speeds, we want liveable streets, and communities where we can walk safely, where our children can get to school unharmed. We call for 30 km/h speed limits.\n\n\u201cAbove 30 is a death sentence. Ms Mandela, granddaughter of Nelson Mandela, lost her 13-year-old daughter, Zenani, in a road traffic accident in South Africa in 2010.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Ghebreyesus and Mandela have joined the heads of many UN and international agencies, civil society organisations, foundations and private companies in signing an Open Letter calling for 30 km/h speed limits in cities worldwide.\n\nThey have highlighted the essential and urgent need to do so to achieve the target of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2021-2030 and the Global Goals generally.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

I don\u2019t want them to blame me if they are denied a journey to perform religious obligations.\n\n\u201cAs the most learned and enlightened group in the state, I am surprised with the turn out of event from the Christian community.

          "title": "Seyi Tinubu: My passion, pains as Asiwaju\u2019s son",
          "text": "By Funsho Arogundade\n\nOluwaseyi Afolabi Tinubu is the eldest son of the former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Recently, some outdoor advertising practitioners alleged that the Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA) is shielding his business interests. Seyi Tinubu runs Loatsad Promomedia Limited, a new digital and outdoor advertising agency. Aside from having exclusive rights on some major roads in Lagos, he is said to enjoy unbridled freedomn. In this interview in his Lekki, Lagos office, the young Tinubu sets the records straight on the signage brouhaha. He also bares his mind on his passion and pains as a son of the political luminary\n\nRecently, there was a report of a crisis between your company, Loatsad and LASAA on one side, and the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN), on the other. Tell us what happened.\n\nIt was nothing really serious, just a little misunderstanding. Everything has been resolved. However, for me personally, there is nothing better than the truth. All that matters to me is to let the truth be the narrative of the story. I don\u2019t have anything to hide because our company, Loatsad is an outfit that operates and follows every regulation of LASAA to the letter. For me, I am particularly against pushing false narratives. So, when I see false narratives being pushed about Loatsad, it really hurts me because this company is beyond Seyi Tinubu. There are over 100 people \u2014from drivers to scores of creative guys\u2014 who work for the group as a whole. But because of an individual, some would then sit somewhere to push a false narrative about a whole company, employing partisan politics to damage the efforts of hundreds of these young individuals? That really hurts.\n\nDo you belong to OAAN?\n\nYes, we are a member, though we are very new.\n\nBut your coming into outdoor advertising has generated a lot of controversies. Questions have been raised about your eligibility as a practitioner. How did you find yourself in the industry?\n\nI didn\u2019t just stumble into the industry. When I finished from Nigeria Law School after I re-sat for my bar exams \u2014I actually failed at my first attempt\u2014 and I was eventually called to the bar, it then dawned on me to figure out what I really wanted to do for myself. What I honestly knew then was that I don\u2019t want to be chasing jobs or work under my father. I had promised myself to earn his respect by creating my own path. My business partner and friend, Adenrele Olusoga, then sat down to look at different opportunities we could explore. We tried many ideas including an online digital movie platform like Netflix which didn\u2019t work out. We really went through various opportunities and looked at those failed experiences after which we discovered we had a passion to create something that would be innovative and unique. By extension, we discovered our flair for advertising, particularly in the digital space. Hence, we decided to float Loatsad Promomedia to operate both in the digital and out-of-home sub-sector of the advertising industry. We applied to the relevant bodies and got the licence to operate. And in the shortest time, we discovered our niche and have made a significant impact.\n\nWhere did the seed money to start Loatsad come from?\n\nWe never started with advertising though. My partner and I had run multiple start-up companies. When we were about to start Loatsad, we had to clear our savings. My wife, Layal, also an entrepreneur, chipped in her resources too. Of course, when you have a dream, you have to be determined and audacious in planning your finances towards the project. We created a timeline alongside our financial plans and that\u2019s what has helped us. We were lucky as our plans scaled through.\n\nThe truth is many still wondered how your very young agency could manage to get those strategic, juicy sites.\n\nOk, let me use the Lekki Tollgate as an example. The owner of that asset is LCC. With regards to the site, would you believe me if I told you that I wasn\u2019t in the country when the company applied and the process for the concession of the site started? Loatsad made an application to LCC and we proposed a new concept of putting an LED on the structure. We also approached Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the regulatory body. While we are still in that process, I left Nigeria for my Masters. My partner continued the whole process. So, if you look through our contract agreements with LCC which I can make available to the public if necessary, we made the best offer to the LCC \u2014N100 million for the concession\u2014 and not that it was just handed over to us like that. But talking about sites and juicy locations, at Loatsad, give us an empty land and we would turn it into a juicy site. You know why? We have a bunch of brilliant guys working to make this happen. We always sit together to put our minds together to create great ideas. That\u2019s what we did also with Falomo Bridge. Before we moved into that location, Falomo was water. We had to sand-fill and dredge that site. We built that site from nothing to how it stands today. You can verify all my claims from those who should know.\n\nYou mean your father\u2019s name didn\u2019t help in acquiring most of these sites?\n\nNo, never. I have never entered any room to demand any site. I have never used my father\u2019s name to influence any site given to me. I do not believe in such practice. I believe that whatever I do, I must be able to be above aboard. I am open to scrutiny and willing to be assessed fairly. Come to think of it, if I have done that, I am very sure multiple people would have come out to counter me. The truth is we grew as a company which evolved from using just static boards and lamp posts to LEDs. We realised there was a new market for us to enter. Digital is the future, and we are the future \u2014we are the youngest in the game here. People were using the traditional methods of putting up a board, and we entered the space and made a change, giving advertisers something significantly more powerful for their brand. For all those who keep talking about Loatsad and my father, one thing they have failed to realise is that Loatsad, on its own strength, has been able to work with a lot of multinationals and partnered with many international tools like Airpush, Shazam, Rocketfuel and Snapchat for pop-ups ads on your mobile. I don\u2019t know whether Snapchat knows who Tinubu is. But Loatsad has been able to build its reputation in its area of business without any external influence. We were invited by Facebook to their headquarters in Seattle, United States about three or four years ago. I think it\u2019s high time people started to give credit to every staff member of Loatsad who is doing all the creative stuff in the industry. It\u2019s not fair for anyone to think we got to where we are because of, maybe phone calls, from my dad to some people. Did the name open the door? Maybe, but if it opens a door in a bank or others, will it open a door with Coca-Cola or other multinationals that use our services? The truth and reality is that we deliver with a great deal of passion. We are persistent and tenacious and we believe we offer real value. Our aim is to let brands thrive in the best possible way and we see our services as a unique medium to facilitate that process.\n\nBut the name has come with some baggage?\n\nDefinitely! Some people think all these successes by Loatsad in our less than a decade of existence was because I am Seyi Tinubu. Sir, if I were in the banking industry today, some people would still talk: \u2018Oh he\u2019s only on top at the bank because he\u2019s Tinubu\u2019s son. What do they want me to do? To be carrying my father\u2019s suitcase up and down? No! The truth is that I cannot tie myself to my father\u2019s apron. I have to be my own man. I have to create my own family and legacy. That\u2019s how my dad and mom \u2014Senator Oluremi Tinubu\u2014 raised us to be. We were all told from day one: once you are done with school, that\u2019s all we can give you.\n\nThe same thing happened during the Corona pandemic. We were all out there helping with foods and other relief packages to support the less privileged affected by the global shutdown. We understand that the majority of Nigerians are living from hand to mouth and we have to help in whatever capacity we can. But while we were doing all that, then we started hearing those funny narratives of \u2018Yes, we said it; they are already grooming the boy as the next governor.\u2019 Which governor? Haba! This is just a pure CSR being carried out by our company. It has become part of my nature not to sit back and watch while some people suffer. I must surely help as much as I can.\n\nYour company also acquired a big outdoor firm, e-Motion for an undisclosed amount. How did you manage to achieve such a huge feat?\n\nLet me tell you a story. When I finished my Masters a couple of years back, my dad called me to his place in Abuja. He asked me what I wanted to do next or where I wanted to work. I said to him that I didn\u2019t want his money but that all I want is his moral support. This is because if I take his money and don\u2019t grow it, he will obviously not be happy with me. In all honesty, when we were about to make a bid for e-Motion, I consulted him. And the only reason for that was to inform him \u2014as a father\u2014 about my worries on how we are going to finance the acquisition. I told him I need a financial backup \u2014that was after I had opened up to him about our company\u2019s finances. All he did was to give me a strong financial advice and plans. And that advice actually worked perfectly for us. The truth is since we acquired E-Motion, till today, we have not finished repayment of the facility.\n\nWasn\u2019t it a 100 per cent acquisition?\n\nYes, it is 100 per cent acquisition. But in our agreement, it wasn\u2019t a one-off payment but staggered.\n\nBut couldn\u2019t your father help out here?\n\nThe truth is my father wasn\u2019t aware when the acquisition was completed. Of course, he knew I wanted to buy a company but he didn\u2019t know it was E-Motion. He didn\u2019t even know when we opened the discussion on the acquisition. Aside consulting him on financing, I also engaged him deliberately to know his perspective about advertising generally. When one has such a brilliant mind like my father, who is so vast in all disciplines, including advertising, banking, law and even real estate, and you can access him, I know he will give a sound advice. That\u2019s all I need from him. But thanks to my partner, our lawyers and the bank, they have helped us to achieve the acquisition without getting into any financial trouble.\n\nWas the investment really worth the effort?\n\nWell, it has been a headache; I must confess. The acquisition was concluded late 2019, and as we were tidying up the deal in the New Year, by March 2020, the coronavirus pandemic hit us. This was followed by the total lockdown and shutdown of businesses. While we were hoping things were coming back to normal, then the Lekki First Roundabout and second roundabout were removed for the junction improvements by the state government. These are some of E-Motion prime sites. So, what exactly did we acquire then? Of course, their sites from Falomo to Kilometre 13 were an addition. But to tell you the truth, what we acquired was a brand new company. For me, I believe then that E-Motion was sitting on a goldmine but they are not actually utilising it enough and we had to step in.\n\nDespite the influence of your father as a prominent figure in this country, do you have any pain at all?\n\nYes I do. As a human being, you have your ups-and-downs. But what pained me the most was when some people attribute our success to my name or my pedigree. It is painful to see the lack of recognition given to these guys who work day and night to make Loatsad the brand it has become. It pains me each time some wrong narratives are pushed to water down all our efforts. Anyways, one of those lessons I was raised with was to always stay true to myself and to never let what anybody else says distract me from my goals. Criticism is needed but baseless accusations and pushing of false narratives help nobody and change nothing. They only serve to further divide us when we should be coming together.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your passion for polo. How did the interest start and do you truly own a stable somewhere in Ikoyi, Lagos as alleged by some people?\n\nI listened to the old man who made those wild claims and found it so unfortunate. The truth is, I do not have a horse stable in Lagos or anywhere in the world. But as we speak now, I am already working on owning my stable. I am building my own stable outside Falomo. In fact, it will be far from the Lagos metro but somewhere close to Epe. I already own some horses and ponies enough to start a team. That\u2019s why I am building my own stable. On my passion for polo, I would say I honestly love polo. I started riding horses at age 8 but started playing polo at age 13. Now, my second home is on a horse because when you\u2019re on a great horse, you have the best seat you will ever have. Horses sometimes give you the wings one lack and while riding a horse, you can borrow some freedom. With that sport, once you are on the field, your brain is free and open. You push aside all the worries about business and every other thing. You are so free and that\u2019s why I\u2019m completely hooked on polo.",

          "text": "\u2022Interactions severed 8 days ago after demanding fresh N170m ransom\n\n\u2022N60m earlier paid by parents ignored\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nParents of the remaining 16 abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna State, have been thrown into further confusion, following the decision of the kidnappers to cut further communications with them.\n\nBandits invaded the school on April 18 and abducted 22 students and a staff. They initially demanded N800 million for the release of the students. However, to push their demand for ransom, they killed five of the students on two occasions, when negotiations were still ongoing.\n\nSources said the last time the kidnappers called any of the parents was on April 8, eight days ago, during which they made fresh demand of N10 million ransom on each of the 16 students and a staff of the university still being held, which comes to N170 million.\n\nPrior to this, the parents had collectively paid N60 million ransom without getting a result.\n\nThe decision of the kidnappers to cut communications for days has been causing great anxiety among the parents, with some of them afraid for the lives of their children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is happening again. We don\u2019t know what is happening to our children. They (kidnappers) are not talking to us again. You know they have been threatening to kill them if we don\u2019t pay more and suddenly we are not hearing anything again. We are so scared and praying that God will touch their hearts not to harm our children. We are anxiously waiting for them (bandits) to call and say something, so that we will know that our children are alive,\u201d remarked one of the parents yesterday.\n\nThe distraught parents are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to help secure the release of the students before \u201csomething sinister happens to them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna yesterday during a special prayer session for the release of the students, spokesman of the parents, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, urged Buhari to use his good offices to secure the release of their children.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnappers have demanded N10 million from each of the parents of the students, making a total of N160 million for 16 students.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about their safety. The innocent students had spent 24 days in the kidnappers\u2019 den. Even after, we the parents have collectively paid them over N60 million ransom for the release of our children, they failed to release them.\n\n\u201cWe, the parents are appealing to the federal government to assist us to pay the ransom demanded or find any other way to ensure the safe return of our children,\u201d Zarmai pleaded.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, the leader of the bandits who abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, on May 3, threatened to kill them if a ransom of N100 million, in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles, were not provided the following day.\n\nJalingo confirmed that the families of the abducted students had already paid N55 million, adding that money had been spent on feeding the students.\n\nOne of the students was released after his parents paid N20 million ransom to the bandits.\n\nThe Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-rufai has not helped matters by openly declaring that he would not pay ransom to kidnappers. However, he has not been able to motivate the rescue of any of the abductees since his declaration.\n\nSecurity agencies have also been lethargic in their approach to freeing the Greenfield 17. Most Nigerians still cannot comprehend why they cannot track the location of the abductees and rescue them, despite previous numerous communications between the parents and the kidnappers.\n\nThe federal government and the Kaduna State Government and security agencies have come under intense criticism for their failure to secure the adducted Greenfield University students after 28 days in the dungeon of their abductors.\n\nAfter the kidnappers killed the first three students, the leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, remarked that it was regrettable that security situation could break down so bad in a regime led by a retired army general.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt shows the extent to which security has broken down under General Muhammadu Buhari. It shows his incompetence and how far he is inefficient as a former commander. Each time we talk about him, Lai Mohammed will put up a propaganda saying everything is in order and Buhari is the best President that we have ever had. It is until they kill all of us that they will now know he should have left the place. Law and order have broken down in the country, there\u2019s no doubt about that. The earlier people persuade Buhari to get out of the place the better for all of us.\u201d\n\nMike Ozekhome, (SAN) said he wasn\u2019t disappointed at the floppy manner in which the federal government has been handling the issue of kidnappings in Nigeria, especially in the recent time.\n\nThe fiery lawyer said Nigerians ought not to be surprised at the turn of things in the country, given the failure of the government to resolve previous kidnappings. He asked, \u201cWhat were Nigerians expecting? Where is Leah Sharibu? Where are the Chibok girls abducted since April 2014? Has this government ever walked the talk in its vain glorious posturing against Boko Haram, armed banditry, herdsmen, kidnapping and other violent crimes across the board in Nigeria? Has Nigeria not been turned into a sprawling field of crimson and pouring the blood of innocent Nigerians?\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

No casualties were reported. However, the office building was extensively damaged while electoral materials and office equipment were destroyed in spite of the best efforts of the Enugu State Fire Service to contain the inferno. The Commission appreciates the intervention of the Fire Service. The attention of the Police has been drawn to this yet another very worrisome development for investigation.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the attack in Udenu Local Government was the third incident involving INEC\u2019s local government offices in three states, in less than two weeks.\n\n\u201cFirst, there was the destruction of the office in Essien Udim LGA of Akwa Ibom State on 2nd May 2021. This was followed by the fire at the Ohafia LGA office in Abia State on 9th May 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another setback to the Commission\u2019s ongoing activities and preparations for upcoming electoral activities,\u201d said Okoye.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission, Okoye said, is determined to continue to discharge its responsibly, including the conclusion of the expansion of voters\u2019 access to polling units, resumption of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), capacity-building activities, the review of the draft Strategic Plan 2022-2026, engagement with stakeholders, as well as all scheduled and pending elections.\n\nAt least, 19 offices of the Commission have been gutted by fire in the last two years, findings have revealed.\n\nA breakdown of the fire incidents showed that the most affected states include Akwa Ibom (4); Abia (3); Anambra (2) and Imo (2).\n\nOther states that witnessed fire incidents between February 2019 and May 2021 are Borno, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Kano, Ondo, Plateau and Rivers. Abuja was also affected.\n\nIt was learnt that while 11 offices were burnt by hoodlums, eight others were gutted by fire under mysterious circumstances or by electrical fault.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has started mobilising its affiliate unions and civil society organisations to join the strike in Kaduna State, scheduled to commence midnight Sunday, May 16.\n\nNLC had threatened to mobilise workers in both public and private sectors to shut down economic activities in the state over what it described as obnoxious anti-worker policies: arbitrary and illegal declaration of redundancies; premature compulsory retirement of all officers on grade levels 14 and above, by the state government.\n\nIn a circular issued by its acting General Secretary, Ishmail Bello, NLC instructed the leadership of all its affiliate unions to ensure that the strike commences from midnight, Sunday, May 16.\n\n\u201cWe write to communicate to all affiliate unions of the NLC to fully mobilise all their members in Kaduna to a complete and indefinite withdrawal of services until a counter directive is issued by the leadership.\u201d\n\nThe circular also urged allies and affiliate unions in neighbouring states to mobilise to Kaduna to support the strike.\n\nAlready, one of the allies, the Centre for Labour Studies (CLS) has offered to give total support for the planned shutdown of economic activities in Kaduna State\n\nA statement signed by its Director, Femi Aborisade said that other unions, including the Trade Union Congress (TUC), should unite and join forces with the NLC to defeat the unitary ideology in industrial relations being spearheaded by the Kaduna State government.\n\n\u201cWe call on all trade unions and pro-labour civil society and human rights organisations to join forces with the NLC in its just strike in Kaduna State against the following obnoxious anti-worker policies: arbitrary and illegal declaration of redundancies; premature compulsory retirement of all officers on grade levels 14 and above, officers who are 50 years and above, and officers who have been in service for 30 years or more; conversion of permanent employees on grade levels 1-6 to casual workers status and stoppage of pension for pensioners who have earned pension for 5 to 10 years but have refused to die,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe centre said that the right to pension \u201cis a constitutionally guaranteed right,\u201d which is also guaranteed in the civil and public service rules in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, Rule 02809 of the Kaduna State Government Public Service Rules (2005) and Part II, Regulation 10(3)(c) at page 34 of the Unified Local Government Service Staff Regulations (2012), provide that the compulsory retirement age for all grades in the service shall be 60 years or 35 years of pensionable service, whichever is earlier,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Centre further said that the phenomenon of physical insecurity involving bloodshed, killings, abductions, kidnappings, insurgency, and terrorism in Kaduna State is related to economic insecurity.\n\nAccording to CLS, Kaduna State has become one of the most dangerous states to visit, work or live. \u201cThis is because of massive layoffs which the state government started in 2016/2017 when about 22,000 teachers, 8,000 workers in MDAs (Ministries, Departments, and Agencies), 800 workers in the state\u2019s Internal Revenue Service Dept, and over 4,000 local government workers were laid off.\n\nCLS adds: \u201cThis year, according to the NLC, the state government has disengaged 6,000 workers, including local government and primary health care workers. Eleven thousand (11,000) workers have been short-listed for disengagement on account of being in service for 30 years and above and/or being on level 14 and above.\u201d\n\nCLS urged other unions, including the TUC, to unite and join forces with the NLC to defeat the unitary ideology in industrial relations and the vicious war on workers\u2019 rights being waged by the Kaduna State government, \u201cotherwise, other state governments would emulate the draconian and wicked labour policies and practices in Kaduna State, and workers\u2019 rights in other states nationally would come under severe threat.\u201d\n\nOfficials of the Kaduna State Government were not available for reactions to the strike starting next Monday, but the government has persistently defended the ongoing rationalization in the civil service, citing bloated wage bill, redundant staff and dwindling revenue.\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai said a significant amount of the statutory federal allocations to the state \u201cis being spent on the wages of public servants.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision to shed weight in the civil service was one of the necessary moves to salvage the state\u2019s finances.\n\nEl-rufai adds: \u201cTherefore, the state government has no choice but to shed some weight and reduce the size of the public service. It is a painful but necessary step to take, for the sake of the majority of the people of this state. The public service of the state with less than 100,000 employees and their families cannot be consuming more than 90% of government resources, with little left to positively impact the lives of the more than 9 million that are not political appointees or civil servants. It is gross injustice for such a micro minority to consume the majority of the resources of the state.\u201d\n\nHe promised to work with the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAS) to expedite payments of the contributory pension benefits to cushion the effect of the disengagement.\n\nEl-Rufai also vowed to give \u201cpreferential treatment to those disengaged that are willing to take advantage of the state government\u2019s various agricultural and entrepreneurship development schemes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Speaking earlier, Deby thanked Nigeria for the solidarity shown after the passage of the former President, noting that the main objective of the Transitional Military Council \u201cis the security and cohesion of our country.\u201d\n\nHe expressed his commitment to democratic, free, fair polls in 18 months, telling President Buhari: \u201cYou were very close to Marshal Itno.

          "title": "On the Asaba revolt by southern governors",
          "text": "If you are a keen observer of Nigerian politics, or should I say politicking, you must have noticed many unusual things about the meeting of the 17 southern governors in Asaba, Delta state, on Tuesday. In the first place, that the southern governors met at all \u2014 and, mind you, every single governor was present; none was represented by a deputy \u2014 is one of the most unusual occurrences since the dawn of this democratic era. While the 19 northern governors meet regularly, the last time southern governors met as a bloc, from my records, was in October 2017. And that was after a 12-year hiatus. The first meeting was hosted by then Lagos governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in 2002.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother unusualness is the \u201csolidarity\u201d. I have always argued that unlike the north that pursues common interests with a single mind no matter the partisan divide, southern politicians traditionally lack a sense of solidarity. Not only are they divided along party lines, the dominant ethnic groups, Igbo and Yoruba, are eternally at each other\u2019s neck, bickering over who owns Lagos and who doesn\u2019t, and spitting bile over the \u00a320 token compensation for the Biafran currency after the civil war. There is also a feeling in the south-south that the south-west conspired with the north to chase President Goodluck Jonathan out of office in 2015. Thus, the Asaba gathering is noteworthy.\n\nIt is also unusual, I would say, for the current set of southern governors, apart from Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, to openly criticise Buhari. Although many governors privately grumble about the president\u2019s lopsided appointments and inaction on many issues, they say something else in public, like sycophants. It\u2019s as if they fear or idolise Buhari so much that they cannot criticise him. This was unlike the case of President Jonathan whom most governors used as toothpick when he was in office. I believe some of the governors who signed the Asaba communique did so reluctantly and I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if they secretly called Buhari later at night to explain themselves remorsefully.\n\nThe Asaba Revolt, if you permit that rather strong expression, is all the more manifest in the resolution of the governors to demand a ban on open grazing and physical movement of cattle \u201cacross Southern Nigeria\u201d \u2014 the keyword being \u201csouth\u201d. The incursion of \u201carmed herders, criminals and bandits\u201d into the south, the governors said, \u201chas presented a severe security challenge such that citizens are not able to live their normal lives including pursuing various productive activities leading to a threat to food supply and general security\u201d. Open grazing has become a touchy political and ethnic issue in Nigeria since the escalation of herders/farmers conflicts in the last four to five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRestructuring \u2014 the southern cudgel \u2014 expectedly featured in the communique, but the southern governors were more specific, or narrow, unlike the regular agitators. They specifically demanded (1) evolution of state police (2) review of revenue allocation formula in favour of the sub-national governments (which will favour all the 36 states and 774 local governments, by the way), and (3) the creation of other institutions which legitimately advance commitment to and practice of \u201ctrue federalism\u201d. Of course, the governors know that Buhari cannot grant any of these three demands. They are clearly constitutional matters to be handled by federal and state lawmakers.\n\nWhat do I think, generally? To start with, I do not want to pre-empt the governors on the proposal to ban open grazing as the details are still sketchy. My preliminary comment would be that you cannot ban open grazing overnight. It has to be well planned. You are dealing with millions of cattle, millions of jobs, millions of families, vital protein nutrition and a multibillion-dollar chain. You cannot disrupt this in one day. There would be unintended consequences. The insecurity will grow beyond crimes \u2014 which you may even expect the security agencies to tackle \u2014 but will extend to untold economic and nutritional crises, disrupting the livelihood of even southerners in the lengthy value chain.\n\nMany are unaware that it is not just the herders that benefit from the cattle business. In fact, they are just a dot in the long line. All they do is breed and sell cattle. By the time the beef lands on your table, values have been created along the line through trading, banking, butchering, processing and vending. Cooking will invite a mesh of ingredients into the pot and Nestl\u00e9 knows that. The food seller\u2019s business is nothing without the beef, which is still the cheapest animal protein in Nigeria. The cow dung is manure for farmers. The bones are used to make chinaware. You know what? Millions of southerners benefit from the chain and probably make more money than the herders themselves!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, northern governors had also admitted in February that \u201cthe current system of herding conducted mainly through open grazing is no longer sustainable in view of growing urbanisation and population of the country\u201d. This was a major shift, coming in the wake of the ethnic tension generated by the quit notice issued to northerners in some southern states over the activities of criminals believed to be herders. Unlike the Asaba resolution, however, northern governors spoke about a transition process, announcing that they had resolved \u201cto aggressively sensitise herdsmen on the need to adopt new methods of herding by ranching or other acceptable modern methods\u201d.\n\nIf southern governors are to ban open grazing and physical movement of cattle, there must be a programme of action which will include transportation and resettlement. One of the best ways of making an ineffective law is to make a law that cannot be obeyed. The end result is more chaos that can only stoke fire across the country. You cannot make herding disappear overnight. The good thing, I think, is that the hardliners in the north have moved from saying \u201copen grazing is Fulani culture\u201d and have now come to accept that things cannot continue like this. The socio-political consequences have damaged Nigeria and only an enemy of progress will insist on the status quo.\n\nLuckily, there are vast lands in the north where the herders can be resettled. I have heard a lot about how Kano Governor Abdullahi Ganduje is making tremendous progress in creating large grazing reserves in the state. That, to me, looks like problem-solving in place of rabble-rousing. Transitioning from open grazing to ranching has to be methodical. It is not a communiqu\u00e9 issue. Since it cannot be enforced overnight, the order will be difficult to obey and the southern governors will only end up giving more ammunition to the Sunday Igbohos and Nnamdi Kanus to continue their ethnic campaigns. The consequences may not spare any part of Nigeria. We need to pause and think.\n\nThe southern governors asked President Muhammadu Buhari to respect \u201cfederal character\u201d in his appointments. This was a bit shocking to me. I used to think southerners see \u201cfederal character\u201d as a dirty phrase to be despised and avoided. I have always argued that those who wrote \u201cfederal character\u201d into our constitution were not stupid \u2014 they wanted to avoid domination by any part of the country. The only way to ensure fairness and promote a sense of belonging in a multi-ethnic federation is to make sure significant federal appointments reflect our diversity. Some analysts believe that a part of the current tension in Nigeria is fuelled by Buhari\u2019s pattern of appointments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was on the phone with a southern governor recently. He said northerners were systematically replacing southerners in positions \u201czoned\u201d to the south: finance ministry, FIRS, NIMASA, etc. \u201cThe president, a northerner, is the minister of petroleum. The NNPC GMD is a northerner. Most agencies under the petroleum ministry are headed by northerners,\u201d he lamented. One southern minister said he did not want to renew the tenure of a \u201cdisloyal\u201d agency head (they are from the same state) but had to rethink \u201cbecause they may go and bring somebody from Katsina state to replace him\u201d. The rascal in me quietly jested: didn\u2019t these guys say federal character should never matter?\n\nWhile I am not trying to downplay the worries and demands of the southern governors, I am more interested in how they can work with Buhari to tackle this crippling insecurity and stop the bleeding in the land. Open grazing needs to stop, I agree; strategic federal appointments must reflect our diversity, I don\u2019t dispute that; Buhari needs to talk to his citizens to calm their nerves, I accept; we need to restructure Nigeria, I concur (although my own ideas are about socio-economic restructuring rather than disguised balkanisation). But, most importantly, what Nigeria needs urgently is first aid. Nigeria is bleeding so profusely that the incurable optimists are worried.\n\nI sympathise with the southern governors: they are under pressure from the streets to say or do something, otherwise they will soon be unable to leave the government house. In 1999-2003, governors of core northern states were under similar tremendous pressure from the streets, with the influence of clerics, to declare Sharia. This is politics: if you don\u2019t eat, you will be eaten. But let us keep this in mind: we need to tackle this insecurity decisively and immediately. All other issues, including open grazing, practising \u201ctrue federalism\u201d and Biafra, will only be relevant if the prevailing anarchy does not consume us all. Nigerians need to be alive first; other things can always follow.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nLIKE MAGU, LIKE HADIZA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who keep saying they can go into government and make a positive impact, I would advise them to take it easy and learn from Ms Hadiza Bala Usman, the suspended MD of the NPA, and Mallam Ibrahim Magu, the sacked boss of the EFCC. Nigeria will kill your spirit. Though far from being perfect (who is perfect?), they both put in decent shifts in tackling the Nigerian rot. Hadiza has been touching the untouchables who think they can get away with anything in Nigeria. Sadly, Hadiza and Magu erroneously thought they had the full backing of President Buhari. I think the signals to forthright people in Buhari\u2019s government are very clear: you are on your own. Unfortunate.\n\nPASTOR\u2019S PLAN B\n\nPastor Paul Adefarasin, the senior pastor of House on The Rock, trended on social media when he asked his church members to have a Plan B out of Nigeria \u2014 even if it is to flee to Cameroon \u2014 because of the current situation. You can pardon Adefarasin, who happens to be one of my favourite pastors, because he is an elite pastor speaking to his elite gathering. The elite will always take care of themselves. In fact, many have multiple citizenships. But let us spare a thought for over 150 million Nigerians who cannot even afford to pay visa fees much less buy flight tickets. And, sadly, they are the most-hit victims of this dysfunctional Nigerian state \u2014 with no possible Plan B. Tragic.\n\nREMAKING NIGERIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just got a copy of \u2018Remaking Nigeria: Sixty Years, Sixty Voices\u2019, edited by Chido Onumah. It is a book of essays by a diverse collection of writers and thinkers Nigeria can boast off, all discussing the present and the future of Nigeria. Among the contributors are: Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, Adebola Williams, Doifie Buokoribo, Amina Salihu, Dike Chukwumerije, Ruona Meyer, Zainab Usman, Idayat Hassan, Chris Adetayo and Yemi Adamolekun \u2014 to name but a few of the array of writers who have consistently contributed to nation building in their spheres of influence. The diagnoses and prescriptions are there and well-articulated. The will to transform Nigeria is the next step. Vital.\n\nCRUDE IGBOHOISM\n\nChief Sunday Igboho, the so-called Yoruba rights activist, made uncharitable comments on the death of the son of Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the general overseer of RCCG. His grouse is that Adeboye has not been using his pulpit to support the agitation for Oduduwa Republic. That Igboho, a veteran political thug, has become a revered leader among the Yoruba is one thing, but that a Yoruba would be hailed for mocking the death of anyone at all says a lot about where the values of Oduduwa descendants are headed. Igboho, whose own family is reportedly in Germany, can continue to beat the drums of war but the comment on late Dare Adeboye is totally distasteful and disgusting. Crude.",

          "title": "Aburi ghosts, Asaba secessionists and waffles in high places",
          "text": "When you listen to Nigeria\u2019s Senate President, Ahmed Lawan\u2019s skewed submission on southern governors\u2019 meeting in Asaba, Delta state last week, you will realise that people in high places too are not immune from marketplace waffles. Miniature logic can proceed from the minds of huge, prarchute-like babanriga wearers after all. More importantly, from the tragic Lawan ill-logics, the much-talked-about January 1967 Aburi Accord will present to you as the quintessential Julius Caesar\u2019s ghost promising to meet its nemesis at Philippi. Finally, you will find out that Nigeria is trapped inside this pit being because it lacks critically thinking leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the assassination of Caesar, Shakespeare depicts him appearing like an apparition to his friend, Brutus and telling him \u201cthou shall see me at Philippi.\u201d Literati say, killed before the maturation of his dreams, Caesar\u2019s ghost was predicting further evils. Buffeted on all fronts by a Federal Government that has become pallbearer of her citizens and a Nigeria under Buhari that has transmuted into a funeral parlour, the fifteen Nigerian governors had gathered to halt the Nigerian burial party. For two days \u2013 January 4 \u2013 5, 1967 \u2013 fifteen high-ranking Nigerians had similarly gathered in Aburi to deliberate on a Nigeria that was about to kiss the canvass. Why they chose this town in the Akuapim South Municipal District of the Eastern Region, South of Ghana that was famous for its Botanical Gardens and the Idwira Festival is yet unknown.\n\nThe 15 Aburi conferees were: Chairman of the Ghana National Liberation Council, Lt.-General Joseph Arthur Ankrah, who was the then Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and chairman of the occasion; Lt. Colonel Gowon; Ojukwu himself; Major Mobolaji Johnson; Lt.-Col. Hassan Katsina; Lt.-Col. David Ejoor; Commodore Joseph Edet Akinwale Wey; Colonel Robert Adebayo; Alhaji Kam Salem and Mr. T. Omo-Bare. They were supported by bureaucrats like N. Akpan, Secretary to the Military Governor of the Eastern Region; Alhaji Ali Akilu, Secretary to the Northern Military Governor; D. Lawani, Under Secretary, Military Governor\u2019s Office, Mid-West; P. Odumosu, Secretary to the Western Military Governor and S. Akenzua, Permanent Under-Secretary, who later became the Oba of Benin.\n\nBy then, it had become obvious that the legs of the dead body the British haphazardly buried in a 1914 makeshift grave had begun to jut out embarrassingly. The Hausa-Fulani oligarchy had come full throttle in its arrogant belief that Nigeria was its to subjugate. Its military wing, which rode on the crest of a July 1966 revenge coup, was effectively coordinating this conquest mindset with clinical precision. Before then, Northern Premier, Ahmadu Bello, concluding that progenies of Uthman Dan Fodio could not effectively compete with the south in western education-propelled leadership, had arrived at the need to strengthen Northern hold on the military. Secession from Nigeria in July 1966 through Operation Araba then became the immediate response of the north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogo had given Murtala Muhammed, Theophilus Danjuma, and the putschists of July, 1966 the blueprint and the path to tread. This it did with its first coup d\u2019etat in any French and British African colony since the wave of independence hit Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. Thus came the killing and ouster of Sylvanus Olympio as a model fitting for example. Aguiyi-Ironsi, beneficiary of an earlier revolutionary coup of January 15, 1966 led by Kaduna Nzeogwu, had bungled the opportunity to strengthen Nigeria on the path of her diversity and plurality. He sunk Nigeria further into an amorphous unitary rule. Olympio, Prime Minister of this tiny French neighbor of Nigeria\u2019s, had shortly after midnight on January 13, 1963, been woken from sleep by soldiers who broke into his presidential home. By dawn, Olympio\u2019s gruesomely mutilated body was discovered by Leon Poullada, America\u2019s U.S. Ambassador, who saw it lying about three doors from the embassy building.\n\nBy June 1966, Ojukwu and the East had confirmed the hostile and imbalanced administration of Nigeria under scions of the oligarchy in khaki. He saw how Eastern Nigerian resources constituted a huge chunk of the federal purse and its skewed deployment to the North. Igbo living in the North were subjected to a vile massacre typical of the bloodletting by 16th century Ethiopian Zimba cannibals. Joa dos Santos, a Portuguese priest living in Southeast Africa, had told the horrific story of how a warlike Zambesi tribe he called the Muzimba kaffirs, \u201chad not only (eaten) the men they kill in war, but sell the surplus in market.\u201d\n\nThe massacre of Igbo, labelled the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom, was in that Muzimba kaffirs mould. It was a series of butchering committed against Ndigbo living in Northern Nigeria from May of that year which got to its peak on September 29. A total of between 8,000 and 30,000 people of Igbo descent were estimated to have been butchered like Sallah rams. This prompted about a million of their kindred fleeing back to the east. It was apparently a reprisal against the killing of Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa and Northern Premier, Ahmadu Bello a few months before. Pictures of the remains of Bello suddenly sprung up on the streets of the North, with Nzeogwu heaving his military jackboots on his head. This was after Bello\u2019s flight to the bosom of his harem, a move that couldn\u2019t rescue him from the bullets of a man who went by the Kaduna middle name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Ojukwu sharpening the machete of war in a bid to fight to redeem his people from the hands of the feudal North, the July, 1967 Aburi meeting was thus a last opportunity to reverse the slide into war. As has been written copiously by scholars, the Aburi Accord was a template for national redemption which, if faithfully implemented, would have saved Nigeria in 1967 and probably avoid the calamity of today. Since the governance structure was skewed in favour of the north, the agreements reached were basically to return Nigeria to true federalism, with devolution of powers being its overarching motive.\n\nAmong others, the Accord agreed that the army be reorganised to restore discipline and confidence in the military and that military governors should have power over military formations in their regions. Also, commissioners of police were to be responsible for maintenance of peace in their domains and area commands under area commanders corresponding to existing regions should be created. After Gowon had agreed to all these in Ghana, it was reported that Akenzua had gone back to tell him that the Accord meant confederation and by implementing it, Jack was on the verge of signing off Nigeria. Scholars have also said that Akenzua was just a puppet and the real forces pulling his strings were from the UK High Commission and other western powers who stood to lose their patrimony were Nigeria to break up.\n\nAll those however became history with Nigeria plunging into a fratricidal 30-month war estimated to have cost three million people. The obstinate failure of Gowon to implement the agreement is held to be one of the major reasons why Nigeria has known no peace thereafter and why, 54 years after, the system could throw up a Buhari as president, a man whose obstinacy and arrogance of power is decidedly worse than Yakubu Gowon\u2019s.\n\nAsaba, it will appear, is a miniature Aburi aimed at preventing Nigeria from going into war. Virtually all actors in the macabre drama called Nigeria are today agreed that vultures and hyenas of war are howling, thirsty for blood and cadavers of the living. Even the Buhari beatification choral group has come to accept that Nigeria is at the precipice. We may not agree on the way forward but that Nigeria is about to go the way of falsely-soldered-together strange bedfellows, is not in doubt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwap the dates from July, 1967 to May 2021 and you will see that the firmament retains same red colour. Calls for secession are ten a dime on Nigerian streets. The Nigerian army has been so thoroughly emasculated that a ragtag insurgent army is killing its troops like chickens. In the first quarter of 2021, 400 people were reported to have been killed by Boko Haram. Ask parents of abducted Greenfield University, Kaduna whose wards kidnappers are asking for multiple of millions of naira whether Nigeria is at war or in peace time. Your guess would be as good as mine. Erstwhile peace of eastern Nigeria has been violently busted by \u201cUnknown Gunmen\u201d who are apparently stronger than an effeminate Nigerian state in the hands of Buhari. The cheapest commodities in Nigeria today appear to be death and blood. Hunger is wracking the bellies of the people so rudely as the economy groans in throes. Everywhere you go, it is weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n\nThe Asaba conferees, like those gathered in Aburi, could see further descent into bloodshed. They asked for restructuring, tenets of which look like the Aburi demands. Cynics knew however that with a government of the deaf that administers Nigeria now, the Asaba conference will never produce any meaningful fruits. Never however could the governors have expected Lawan to so narrowly view the horror that is today\u2019s Nigeria. While fielding questions from State House correspondents last Thursday, like Gowon who put on the lens of myopia and thus saw only secession in the Aburi Accord, for Lawan too, restructuring approximated a dismemberment of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI believe that as leaders, those of us who were elected must not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing because even if you are a governor, you are supposed to be working hard in your state to ensure that this restructuring you are calling for at the federal level you have done it in your state as well,\u201d he waffled.\n\nSince taking over power in the revenge coup of 1966, the North has so cleverly tampered with the structure of Nigeria, through demographics and allied institutional maneuvering, so badly that no other region can take any consequential decision about restructuring Nigeria, except with its imprimatur. This was apparently what emboldened the Fulani, serially fingered in the dastardly murders across the country, to audaciously talk down on the rest of Nigeria. On Friday last week, the murderously militant wing of the Fulani, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, through its National Secretary, Alhassan Saleh, threatened that Fulani would be the first to leave Nigeria, while insulting the rest of us. And nothing will happen, because Buhari, his fellow Fulani, is in power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHerders are insignificant when it comes to problem of this country, are they the ones looting the treasury? What damages (sic) are they causing to this country? Compare to the criminal activities of \u2018Yahoo\u2019 boys, kidnappers, political looters, bandits in power, vagabonds in power like Governor (Samuel) Ortom, do you think if there is no oil money, all these things will be happening? Today we are ready, let them divide the country; let them not wait till tomorrow. We are better prepared than any ethnic nationality. So we are ready, let them divide the country, let us die, we that don\u2019t have the oil,\u201d he had thundered.\n\nLawan\u2019s waffle was to be followed by a similarly colourless doggerel, this time from the jokester in Lugard House, Lokoja, Yahaya Bello. Speaking last week on a Channels Television\u2019s programme, Politics Today, Bello said that by seeking a restructuring of Nigeria to douse the tension in the land and calling on Buhari to address the people, his governor counterparts from the south were heating up the polity. Ostensibly, by asking Buhari to at least come out to address Nigerians by himself and not via proxy, the governors reasoned that he would be assuring all that he could still speak coherently, widespread belief of his cognitive hamstring notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cWhen we are talking of security, unity and national cohesion of Nigeria, as leaders and politicians, we should be careful about the words we use\u2026When it is titled or when it appears as if you are fighting President Muhammadu Buhari, our father and our President, we are all getting it wrong because we got to where we are today as a result of maladministration of successive administrations,\u201d the groveller-for-presidential- office governor said. This is a Bello under whom Kogi is a replica of Haiti\u2019s Papa, Baby Doc tyrannical enclave and where the bridge that collapsed in his state recently euphemistically symptomises governance that had fallen.\n\nThey said a people is deserving of its rulers. How did we deserve the trio of Buhari, Lawan and Bello, acting in cahoots with many other short-sighted rulers, whose reasoning is diametrically different from the rest of Nigerians\u2019? Does Nigeria deserve frozen reasoning, like ones glazed in the Antarctica, which oozes out of her leaders? Why is it that the rest of Nigeria sees ominous signs of collapse, a Nigeria twirling on the precipice, while what the leaders see is north, Federal Hausa-Fulani Government, positions at the top and how they can rule till the morning of Armageddon?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForty years after Bob: Was he greater than Peter Tosh?\n\nLast Tuesday, the world marked the 40th anniversary in the grave of foremost Jamaican music legend, Robert Nesta Marley, popularly known as Bob Marley. He had died of melanoma cancer on May 11, 1981 at the University of Miami Hospital And Clinics, UHealth Tower, Miami, Florida, United States. Born to a British World War soldier, Novan and mother, Cedella Booker, on February 6, 1945 at his maternal grandfather\u2019s farm in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, his death at the age of 36, placed side by side his global fame while alive and even much more in death, has buoyed that clich\u00e9 that life is not how long but how well.\n\nTomes of works have been done on his magnificent stardom and impact on the transformation of the raw Jamaican Ska chant into a global musical brand that it would be a rehash doing that here. A major intellectual engagement however has been the argument: who is the greatest between him and his friend, brother and later sworn enemy, Peter McIntosh, popularly known as Peter Tosh?\n\nIn terms of global acceptance, exposure and spread, there is no doubt that Marley is and was the toast of the world. While Tosh was still peaking in his native Jamaica, Marley had received a head start, principally from the early exposure given him by Christ Blackwell, the British owner of the international record label, Island Records. Blackwell\u2019s choice of Marley among the trio of Bob, Peter and a recently deceased colleague of theirs, Neville O\u2019Rilley, popularly known as Bunny Livingstone, has been put to racism and marketing strategy. While the trio, in 1962, decided to form a band which they named The Wailers, Peter was said to have taught the duo how to play the guitar. In their a little more than a decade of being together, The Wailers became a huge commercial success. The New York Times referred to them as \u201cthe most popular and admired of all reggae groups\u201d and the band sold more than 250 million albums worldwide.\n\nThey however all went their ways in 1974, partly due to Blackwell\u2019s preference for a mulatto Bob who would appeal to the western market, ahead of the two other weed-smoking, outlaw-looking musical urchins. Peter and Bunny had been shocked when, at their maiden UK tour organised by Blackwell, they had been confronted by the advertisement of their band as Bob Marley and The Wailers, as against their erstwhile The Wailers. Peter was to later lament that he \u201ctaught him how to play guitar and now they say he\u2019s king of reggae.\u201d\n\nPeter was everything that Bob was and even more. For years, many people did not identify the raw talent and artistic bravura combined in the works of the 6.4 feet dreadlocked singer. This was due to his perceived arrogance and diffidence. For instance, immediately Bob died, Tosh had shocked the world in an interview where he claimed that Bob had peaked while he was decorating the stage. The truth is, Tosh was too assertive, too hot to handle and never hid his disdain for what he called Babylonian lifestyle of hedonism. Tosh believed in marrying words with action. Towards the latter part of his life, he cut a queer image of a revolutionary ready to carry arms. With his imposing height as he adorned a black beret, with a guitar that had the shape of an M16 assault rifle, Tosh didn\u2019t mince words in projecting the narrative that he was a musical militant. He told those who underrated him that he was \u201clike you are steppin\u2019 razor\u201d and asked, \u201cdon\u2019t you watch my size\u201d as \u201cI am dangerous!\u201d In comparison to others, Tosh said \u201cI\u2019m the Toughest,\u201d an apparent reference to the trained karate belt holder that he was. He was once asked by an interviewer why he never smiled and he said that since he sang revolutionary song which was not love song, nor a tea party, he saw no reason to smile.\n\nWhile they were both very spiritual, Peter was more. He was a strict Rastafarian, obeying its injunctions of not mixing with menstruating women, observing its strict dietary prescriptions and believed in doing good to his fellow man.. Apart from pursuing a path of goodness to his fellow man, his lyrics are laced with biblical quotations. Of the three original Wailers, though he didn\u2019t have much education, he was the most cerebral. He could chant endlessly, quoting biblical verses with baffling mastery. The Mystic Man was perhaps the avenue Tosh used to showcase his spirituality the most. He had proclaimed his mysticism in that he doesn\u2019t \u201cdrink no champagne\u2026I don\u2019t sniff them cocaine (as it) choke(s) brain\u2026 I don\u2019t take morphine (dangerous)\u2026I don\u2019t take no heroin\u2026 I man don\u2019t eat up your fried chicken\u2026I man don\u2019t eat up them frankfurters\u2026I man don\u2019t eat down the hamburger\u2026I man don\u2019t drink pink, blue, yellow, green soda\u201d and the reason, he said, was because he was \u201ca man of the past, living in the present and walking in the future.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the depth of their songs, Tosh was deeper. He was what could be regarded as a linguistic gymnast and a poet. In his songs, you would encounter raw poetry, with alliterations and virtually all the figures of speech. The word \u201coppressor\u201d Tosh called \u201cdownpressor,\u201d imputing that those who committed such a heinous crime of oppression against blacks should not be dignified with any lifting up. The manager, to him, was the \u2018damager\u2019, the judge, a \u2018grudge\u2019, the system was \u2018shit-stem\u2019 and the Prime Minister, the \u2018Crime Minister\u2019 who \u2018shits\u2019 (sits) in the \u2018House of Represent-a-t\u2019iefs\u2019.\u201d Christopher Columbus was Christopher \u2018Combulus\u2019 and Alexander the Great was, \u201cAlexander So Called The Great.\u201d In one of his vinyl he entitled Here comes the judge, just like in Downpressor man, Tosh demonstrated how, on the last day, in the presence of \u201cThe Most High Jah,\u201d oppressors of blacks on earth would face the wrath of providence, running to the rocks \u201cbut the rocks will be melting.\u201d A great word user that he was, Tosh had told a 40-000-strong audience that he was not a man of peace as \u201cpeace\u201d was \u201cthe diploma you get in the cemetery\u201d because on the tombstone, it is written, \u201cRest in Peace!\u201d\n\nWhile both ex-friends sang Get up, stand up, a song which the trio of erstwhile Wailers sang individually, they made mockery of Christian and Islamic religion, in both religions\u2019 transference of succor for man to an unseen creator. The song asked man to seek redemption here on earth and proclaim that man was tired of the ism and schism of dying and going to heaven in Jesus name because \u201cthe mighty God is a living man,\u201d a reference to Haile Selassie whom Rastafarians worship as God. Tosh\u2019s own version of the song, which though wasn\u2019t as high-tempoed and popular as Bob\u2019s, is however unique for the introduction of a slow tempo into it. Same theme was also in Coming in Hot where Tosh demonstrated the fieriness of his song. Like the gun guitar image of a tough militant that he created, the lyrics of this song compared the ferociousness of the Tosh brand to a gunshot or explosives.\n\nWhile Tosh was assassinated on September 11, 1987 after he had just returned to Jamaica from a US business trip and was relaxing by watching a TV satellite show at home with his common law live-in-lover, Marlene Brown, Marley had succumbed to cancer. Gunmen, led by Dennis \u201cLeppo\u201d Lobban, one of Tosh\u2019s \u2018boys\u2019 whom he sustained as part of the communal Rastafarian injunction of brotherly co-existence. They had stormed his house at Barbican Road residence, St Andrew, Jamaica at about 7.30pm on this day. Within a twinkle of an eye, the gunmen had put a full stop to his 42-years of existence. At first, talks were rife that Marley\u2019s wife, Rita who controlled his estate, had a hand in Tosh\u2019s murder as the original Wailing Wailers friends of Marley made a legal claim to his multi-million dollar Tuff Gong studio on Hope Street in Kingston. This was exacerbated by interviews granted by the lone survivor of the triumvirate, Bunny who accused Rita of being a Jezebel and that Peter was actually sleeping with her while married to Bob.\n\nWhile Bob Marley\u2019s adaptation of Emperor Haille Selassie\u2019s speech at the OAU in 1978 into a song he entitled War, attempted to rouse blacks from their mental slavery and dependency on the west, Tosh\u2019s own Arise black man conjured the Socratic credo of \u201cMan, know thyself.\u201d It was one of the strongest messages from any musician wherein Tosh spelt the need for the black race to unite and fight for equal rights. Deploying violent imageries, Tosh also predicted that the end of mental slavery was near and attacked those who didn\u2019t see this, stating that \u201cheaven becomes your grave.\u201d\n\nAt personal comparative level, this writer has severally claimed that Tosh was a greater talent than Marley. Though many of their endowments verged in each other, the former was far more endowed than the latter. No one can however dispel the fact that the duo contributed immensely to what is today reggae music, as well as their yeoman roles in the deployment of music as a liberation struggle weapon.",

          "text": "Airtel Africa, the holding company for Bharti Airtel\u2019s operations in Africa, has released its financial report for the year ended March 31, 2021. One of the report highlights is that the company\u2019s revenues are up by 14.2% to $3.8 billion.\n\nOn the back of this revenue, Airtel Africa also posted net profits of $415 million, a slight growth of 1.8% from the previous year where it made $408 million in profits after tax.\n\nDespite the flat profit growth, it is still an impressive result for the business in a year where Covid-19 has stalled economic growth across Africa. Additionally, in Nigeria, the company\u2019s biggest market, a ban on SIM card registration stifled growth.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s CEO, Raghunath Mandava, said in a statement, \u201cIn these challenging times, I want to say a huge thank you to all our employees, our business partners, and governments and regulators who have supported us, and in turn facilitated our continued support to the economies and communities we serve.\n\nOur performance has been strong, \u201cwith reported growth of 13.6% in underlying revenue and 18.3% in underlying EBITDA, and constant currency growth of 19.4% and 25.2%, respectively. Contributions to this growth came across all regions, with particular improvement in Francophone Africa, and across all our major services, with mobile money, data and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nA look at the company\u2019s significant services shows that voice revenue continues to lead the way, bringing in more than half its revenue. Yet, that does not tell the whole story, as the growth in voice revenue has slowed over the last few years.\n\nData and mobile money revenue are the real stars of the show. Data contributed 35% to the revenue as it continues to show promise as Airtel deepens its investment in internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cData usage per customer reached 2.6 GB per customer (from 1.8 GB per customer) led by an increase in smartphone penetration and expansion of our home broadband and enterprise customers. This helped us grow data revenue 31.2% in constant currency. Growing penetration and usage of 3G and 4G data customers helped us grow data ARPU 8.2%. 4G data usage more than doubled in the year, contributing 62.2% of total data usage on the network in Q4\u201921.\u201d\n\nAirtel Money is also seeing significant growth, adding $401 million to revenue compared to the $311 million it added last year. According to Airtel, \u201cWe have increased the number of mobile money agents by 30.7%, kiosks by 68.8% and mobile money branches by 95%. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, both through partnerships with leading financial institutions and through expansion of our merchant ecosystem, have further strengthened our mobile money propositions.\u201d\n\nAnother important update from the report is a leadership change at Airtel Africa as Mandava will retire from his post and as a director on 30 September. Olusegun Ogunsanya will take over as the new managing director and CEO.",

          "title": "A startup bill for Nigeria is being discussed between founders, investors and government reps",
          "text": "One landmark acquisition, several funding rounds and meaningful expansions have drawn attention to Nigeria\u2019s potential to become an enabling environment for businesses. Nigerian tech startups are raising larger seed rounds and pursuing unique global ambitions than at any other time in the last decade.\n\nBut in the last 18 months, major regulatory events that ended motorcycle-hailing and suspended cryptocurrency transactions through banks have been interpreted as setbacks to innovation.\n\nOne problem with these types of regulations is how sudden they are, seemingly without forewarning from the hammer bearers. They raise an unambiguous question: can startups really flourish in Nigeria?\n\nTo dispel such fears and sustain optimism about doing business in Nigeria, startup leaders are fishing for solutions with the cooperation of government officials. One urgent offer on the table is a Nigeria startup bill.\n\nMaking laws work\n\nLast weekend, Kola Aina*, founding partner of Ventures Platform, talked about a plan to \u201cco-create an executive bill that will support the growth of our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe event was a virtual ecosystem townhall with the theme Making laws work for startups in Nigeria.\n\nAina was joined by Adaeze Sokan, Ventures Platform\u2019s director of strategy and policy; Iyin Aboyeji*, general partner of Future Africa; and Adia Sowho, acting CEO of Thrive Agric.\n\nAlso on the call were Oswald Guobadia, senior special assistant to the Nigerian president on digital transformation; Ife Adebayo, special assistant to the vice president on innovation and entrepreneurship; and Jon Stever, managing director of Innovation for Policy Foundation (i4Policy), a consultancy.\n\n\u201cMany of us have tried to do business with certain countries and institutions, and many of them often cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason they can\u2019t interact with us,\u201d Sowho said, explaining the need for a startup act.\n\nApart from disruptive regulation, she listed weak infrastructure and difficulty accessing capital among the problems facing Nigerian startups.\n\nA startup act could be a first step in setting up a structure around these problems. Tunisia (in 2018) and Senegal (in 2019) passed startup laws under similar rationales. Startup acts are becoming recognised as a tool for policy innovation in Africa.\n\nGlobal standard, local context\n\nSo what should a Nigerian startup act look like? Firstly, it must reflect the country\u2019s present reality.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is overborrow from the context of other countries,\u201d Sowho said.\n\n\u201cWe need the minutiae of this bill to be from our experience and understanding of this country of ours that is just very difficult to compare to other places.\u201d\n\nThat said, Nigerian startups operate within a global business environment. For one, the majority of venture capital investment in the sector comes from foreign inflows. This binds startups to international standards on operations, ethics and ambition.\n\nAt the very least, Nigerian startups should have enabling business conditions similar to those being designed in Senegal and Tunisia, but also in Ghana (which passed Africa\u2019s first small business act in 1981), South Africa, Kenya\u2026 and with some effort, the United States.\n\nJon Iver of i4Policy making a presentation about small business and startup Acts in Africa\n\ni4Policy helped co-create Senegal\u2019s startup act two years ago. At the townhall, Stever showed a timeline of small business and startup acts in Africa; Nigeria was not present.\n\nHe observed that startup acts are not made through regular lawmaking processes but typically result from entrepreneurs taking the initiative themselves.\n\nBut something else is noteworthy: \u201cIn the cases where this has been really successful, there has always been a government champion that wants to listen to startups,\u201d Stever said.\n\nIt would then seem a good omen for Nigeria\u2019s startup bill plans that this townhall had two government advisors, who work at the intersection of digitization and entrepreneurship, in attendance.\n\nGuobadia called attention to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s new year address, about a need for \u201can enabling environment to turn [young people\u2019s] passions into ideas that can be supported, groomed and scaled.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s agencies have made some moves in this regard.\n\nIn 2018, the Office of ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIIE) was involved in tech policy hackathons in Lagos and Abuja to develop frameworks for entrepreneurship and innovation. One goal of the Ministry of Digital Economy\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2030 strategy document is \u201c[supporting] digital entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions for local and global challenges.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment announced that a draft National Policy on Startups was on the government\u2019s agenda. Otunba Niyi Adebayo, the minister, has made a point of attending startup-related events, whether about attracting investment or engaging startups on what they are building.\n\nCurrently in a virtual meeting with The Bulb Africa Partnership who are presenting a mobile money and peer-to-peer payment/market place and showing interest in setting up a tech hub/campus to support tech startups and train youth who are interested in pic.twitter.com/yqaxf9ReGY \u2014 Otunba Niyi Adebayo (@NiyiAdebayo_) January 7, 2021\n\nIs this another false start?\n\nIt is great to have ecosystem players take the startup bill bull by the horns. But there were reminders \u2013 from Mark Essien, Hotels.ng CEO, and Lexi Novitske, a venture capitalist \u2013 that we have sort of been here before.\n\nGuobadia agreed, but said the presidency has spent time assessing what it would take to do better this time. They have identified a process problem, which will be solved by a \u201cbig tent\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cWe are building a fabric to knit all [relevant] agencies into this initiative. We took the effort to avoid having competing conversations,\u201d Guobadia said.\n\nAina\u2019s presentation indicated that the Nigerian presidency intends to introduce a draft legislation as early as August. It will be based on a draft startup law by ecosystem leaders with input from federal and state stakeholders from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nThe plan for a Nigeria startup bill\n\nTimelines could shift but parties involved in this bill have been in conversations for about two months, Aina said.\n\n\u201cI am very aware that there is already an ongoing consultation with the Lagos state government,\u201d he said, mentioning that a presidential advisory group on the proposed bill has been having meetings.\n\nKola Aina is one of the members of the Nigeria startup ecosystem leading the startup bill efforts\n\nAboyeji said the plans are still evolving at the moment but he is optimistic that this time could be different.\n\n\u201cI think versus other times, we have grown to such a size and scale that is easy to see what the potential benefits of fixing this issue could be.\u201d\n\nHe and Sowho emphasised that a Nigerian startup bill that works will not be achieved without startups participating in the process. \u201cThis will require sweat from all of us and we should be ready to put the work in,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nThe group has set the ball rolling and welcomes interested people to volunteer for the effort by sending an email to partners@venturesplatform.com, or provide feedback through this form.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: TechCabal hosted this event and has a representative on the Advisory Board for the startup bill project. *Through their firms, Kola Aina and Iyin Aboyeji are investors in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",
          "summary": "In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem.\nNupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa.\nThe Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering).\nThe startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation.",

          "text": "Source: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nIn April, TECNO launched the Spark 7 series, a new addition to the brand\u2019s Spark line-up, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIn TECNO\u2019s usual way, the Spark 7 comes with a lot of impressive upgrades when compared to its predecessors under the flagship. For the purpose of this article, we will be focusing on the more popular of the series, the Spark 7P.\n\nOut of the box, the Spark 7P comes in four colour variations \u2013 the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations \u2013 which allows for vivaciously interesting choices to pick from when in the market to buy the Spark 7P device.\n\nSCREEN FOR MAXIMUM VIEW\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nThe Spark 7P\u2019s screen is impressively massive and elegant. The device comes with a bigger and better 6.8-inch edge-to-edge display and a screen resolution of 720*1600 HD, bringing to your fingertips an immersive cinematic experience. Without a doubt, movie lovers, gamers and even vloggers will enjoy unfettered fun in whatever form they choose.\n\nTOP-NOTCH PICTURE QUALITY\n\nSpark 7P\u2019s 8MP selfie camera appears in a notch at the top of the device, with 2 LED flash positioned on both sides of the camera. At the back is the 16MP dual camera, with a depth sensor second module that makes the device\u2019s Video Bokeh feature possible. The camera can record 240fps slow-motion videos. Users can also enjoy close-up photography with a 4cm macro photography mode that allows to capture small and minute details. Additionally, the device includes AI HDR technology to increase dynamic range beyond what is captured by the camera\u2019s sensors, allowing users to take photos with a higher dynamic range, fewer noise and clearer details.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nSummarily, with the Spark 7P\u2019s newly upgraded algorithm AI Camera 3.0 and AI scene detection, photos taken by the device will be much more impressive and attractive under any scenario.\n\nPRIVACY FOR A HIGH PERFORMING MACHINE\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nOne special feature that comes with the Spark 7P is the Peak proof which lets you leave a portion of your screen dark so you can keep personal information out of the glare of people when you use your phone in public places.\n\nThe Spark 7P also packs a punch with a powerful 5,000 mAh battery, so that consumers can run powerful applications and multiple tabs without the need to constantly recharge. The high-performance device that runs on HIOS 7.5 allows for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting the mobile device. The operating system is also bundled with utility applications that allow users to free up memory, freeze applications and limit data accessibility to applications. With the device\u2019s dark mode, the phone also gives users more battery time and decreased blue light emission, reducing eye strain.\n\nAnother highlight of the Spark 7P is its 90Hz refreshing speed. With the blazing-fast 90Hz refresh rate, the animation on the device doesn\u2019t have to look like a flip book, but one smooth, snappy, and refreshing experience.\n\nIn terms of storage capacity, the Spark 7P is available in sizeable 4GB ROM+ 64GB RAM and 4GB+128GB versions and is available at a sweet price range of 60,900 Naira and 68,800 Naira respectively.\n\nTECNO\u2019s Spark series targets trendy students, but has quickly risen to become popular among young working professionals and middle-aged folks. If you are expecting my verdict on the Spark 7, considering its sleek look and feel, camera, battery, high performance and price, I will rate it an 8/10.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa's audience directly. Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland.

Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick. And quite honestly, I still don\u2019t know which to go for between the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations.\n\nNeed I say more? Spark 7P checks all my boxes!

          "text": "On Saturday, May 8, 2021, the first dedicated Nigerian blockchain hub, Convexity Blockchain Hub (CBHUB), was inaugurated in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Stakeholders in the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN).\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the hub, Adedeji Owonibi, CBHUB Founder, says the aim is to create a hub ecosystem where people can come and just focus in a space dedicated to blockchain technology, a space to innovate and create solutions within Nigeria using blockchain.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, the hub will offer blockchain solutions that have absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian blockchain technology ecosystem is an arena relatively unknown to a lot of Nigerians. It is often confused with its more well-known subset, cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are popular uses of blockchain, it can also be used for other things, such as the solutions CBHUB would provide.\n\nThese solutions range from its Convexity Humanitarian Aid Distribution Solution (Chats), which is geared towards creating transparency in the aid distribution space to BitCert, one of its projects aimed at reducing certificate counterfeiting in schools.\n\nAs at launch time, CBHUB has partners in Lagos and also supports communities in Northern Nigeria, teaching classes in the local Hausa language.\n\nThis is a far cry from 2018 when Paxful, a leading Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency exchange, reported that it would be launching a blockchain incubator hub. This hub was to be headed by Chimezie Chuta, the Founder of Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG).\n\nHowever, Chuta says that after reviewing the information provided, the company wasn\u2019t convinced of the initiative\u2019s viability as a self-sustaining business. Ultimately, Paxful decided to pull the plug.\n\nFirst cryptocurrency forensics lab in Africa\n\nThe first African crypto forensics lab was also launched at the event on Saturday. The lab boasts world-class facilities and is the result of a partnership with Chainalysis, a global leader in the cryptocurrency forensics sphere.\n\nA Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime Report cites South Africa-based company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), as the biggest crypto investment scam of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, illicit cryptocurrency trading accounted for just 2% of Africa\u2019s $16 billion trading volume from July 2019 to June 2020, with scams accounting for 55% of this low level of illicit activity.\n\nWhile Africa has the lowest numbers for illicit cryptocurrency trading globally, the launch of CBHUB\u2019s crypto forensics lab is yet another plus in the fight against crypto scams like MTI.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, there are ways to attach identities to blockchain users despite the relative anonymity/pseudonymity of the technology.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) can be aggregated from crypto exchanges, laptops, and phones through which people interact with the blockchain technology.\n\nThe hub will provide essential tools for crypto-crime investigators and security agencies constantly faced with numerous challenges while investigating crypto-based crimes and illicit money transaction activities.\n\nAll that the investigators need is to reskill and upskill on how to use these tools, says Chuta.\n\nConvexity, truly the first?\n\nWhile CBHUB is undoubtedly Nigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub, it is not the first blockchain hub to be established in the country. In 2015, Blockchain Tech Hub was founded by Samuel Benedict Ogbonnaya.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn profile, it \u201cwas established with the aim of pioneering Blockchain innovation in Africa by training and producing the best qualified Blockchain developers in Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Tech Hub is no longer in operation; the link to its advertised website returns a \u201cThis site can\u2019t be reached\u201d page. Attempts to reach Ogbonnaya were futile as his LinkedIn and Twitter accounts last recorded activity in 2019.\n\nNigeria and blockchain\n\nIn October 2020, NITDA announced that it had started developing a blueprint and strategy document for the \u201cNational Adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIt followed this announcement with the release of the Draft National Blockchain Adoption Strategy. The document outlines the roadmap and strategies for adopting blockchain technology by the government in its digital transformation agenda.\n\nIt also highlights the strategic objectives and initiatives that the government will actively pursue through designated Ministries, Departments, & Agencies (MDAs) during the stipulated period.\n\nWhile the Federal Government of Nigeria has so far been silent on its steps going forward, the launch of the CBHUB portends a step in the right direction in Nigeria\u2019s blockchain adoption journey, especially regarding education and skilling up.\n\nThis, of course, must be reviewed in the light of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest crypto order which threw Nigerian crypto traders into a panic in February 2021.\n\nCBN ordered banks to close the accounts of persons or entities transacting cryptocurrency or operating a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt this stage, with its seemingly conflicting policies, two questions come to mind: Should Nigerian blockchain enthusiasts be cautiously optimistic? Would the Nigerian government take any more positive steps regarding blockchain soon?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions in the coming days should reveal more on this.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

The exercise is commendable, we believe it is going to improve with time. I commend residents along Igbesamwan Road where we observed a good level of compliance in the area.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the street, you will see that the road is clean, except for few areas where they need to clean up the gutters and clear overgrown weeds that have to be taken care of. We are already notifying persons that should be responsible as notices have been served and the areas we need to come in as well.\n\n\u201cDespite the good level of compliance, it is not to say we have gotten to where we are going. There is a need to embark on more of the exercise by ensuring compliance in other areas for people to be aware of the need to comply,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt is essential to know that there is an enforcement going on along with this environmental exercise. Anybody that is caught not doing their bit will be persecuted. We will continue to sensitize residents on the need not to patronize unregistered and illegal waste collectors.\n\n\u201cWe are using this opportunity to reemphasize again that the Saturday sanitation exercise is continuous. There is no restriction of movement but there is enforcement for those who will not keep their surroundings clean,\u201d he added.\n\nThe environmental health officers visited Boundary Road, all adjourning streets up to Ihama as well aa Sakponba Road and all adjourning streets up to 2nd East circular.\n\nOther areas visited include: Five Junction through TV Road, adjourning streets up to Isekhere, Lagos street axis, adjourning streets up to Iwehen and Wire road, Sapele road axis, among others.\n\n...",

          "text": "A magnificent long-range strike from Youri Tielemans gave Leicester City their first FA Cup triumph with a 1-0 victory over Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday, in front of the biggest crowd in England since March 2020. Both Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho started the final at Wembley.\n\nThe Foxes had the fortune of a tight VAR call on former Leicester defender Ben Chilwell, in the 90th minute, and after being losing finalists in 1949, 1961, 1963, and 1969, the Foxes finally broke their duck with the 1-0 win over last season\u2019s losing finalists. Ndidi and Iheanacho also win their first title with Leicester under Brendan Rodgers.\n\nLeicester had been beaten in all their three previous FA Cup final appearances, most recently in 1969, and it was a goal that will be remembered as one of the finest in the competition\u2019s 149-year history that earned their maiden win.\n\nThere was late drama when Wes Morgan put through his own goal in the 89th minute to get Chelsea thinking they were taking the game into extra-time, only for VAR to rule it out for offside.\n\nEven after a loss, however, the Chelsea supporters will surely look back with fondness on a day when for the first time in over a year, there was a real football atmosphere with 21 000 fans filling the 90 000-capacity stadium with noise.\n\nThomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea dominated the first half but struggled to create major openings, even after Leicester lost their centre half Jonny Evans to injury in the 34th minute.\n\nTielemans\u2019s goal will count among the finest to win this 149-year old competition. Collecting the ball centrally he pushed forward and as the Chelsea defence backed off he unleashed a perfectly struck drive which the diving Kepe Arrizabalaga could do nothing about.\n\nChelsea felt there had been a handball in the build-up but they still had chances to get back on level terms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Leicester full back Ben Chilwell, on as a Chelsea substitute, headed against the post and Mason Mount forced a superb save from Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nThere was late drama when Chelsea thought they had levelled after Caglar Soyuncu attempted to clear a Chilwell cross and the ball struck Morgan before ending in the net.\n\nTo Leicester\u2019s relief and Chelsea\u2019s dismay, however, the VAR replay showed that Chilwell had been offside.\n\nThe final whistle prompted emotional celebrations from Leicester, the 2016 Premier League winners who enjoying the most successful period in their history.\n\nFor Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers this was his first trophy in English football to follow his successes in Scotland with Celtic.\n\nTuchel still has a chance of lifting silverware when Chelsea face Manchester City in the Champions League final on May 29 in Porto.",

          "title": "Opinion: Zoning: A distraction from liberal democracy \u2014 Why Enugu should think big first \u2013 By ROBERT AJAH",
          "text": "With her own peculiar challenges, Nigeria has struggled for a place in history to emerge as Africa Democracy. This struggle began many years ago with the military, sabotaging the spirit of the struggle. However, the struggle continued and had managed to survive two decades of democratic dispensation without capitulation. There is hope therefore, that we can secure our rightful place in history as the pride of Africa Democracy. But to reach this milestone, we need to articulate our principles according to best practices, and shun every temptation of mediocrity.\n\nTo be candid, for our society to attain the true goal of democracy as in civilized societies, myopic views as zoning and sectionalism, must be bundled and thrown into the waste bin. The reason this must be done is simple \u2014 democracy as the best form of government, is conceived on the principle of \u2018majority interest\u2019 or simply say, majority rule. It is not a rule by the minority for which zoning is predicated on \u2014the dictates of the minority interest\u2014 the elites.\n\nZoning had not only contradicted the idea of majority interest, it had also undermined even-development and diversification of economy of Enugu State. As could be seen from recent Enugu State leaderships, zoning arrangement only benefitted the sections where the leaders emerged from instead of the state as a whole. As a distorted view of democracy, zoning promotes sectional parochialism since the leaders prioritized their zones for developments to the exclusion of other parts of the state.\n\nSo, I think that the sentiment for zoning has created a system of injustice on the allocation of resources and execution of key infrastructures in the state. Had Enugu sticked to the idea of liberal democracy, by now every part of the state would have developed reasonably on equal scale including my own village, Okpanku.\n\nMeanwhile, the proponents of zoning had almost made the theory look like a solution to leadership quagmire, but a conscious look into the arrangement will unravel its ugly side as impediment to even-development. In other words, if zoning is remedial to Enugu political tussle, why is it that the zones where the leaders emerged from are better developed than others? We can confidently see that zoning as panacea to power equation, has done a great injustice to the developmental goals of the state. This is why I think zoning is a total distraction from liberal democracy whose primary dividend is inclusive governance.\n\nAs a reminder, the likes of Dr Michael Okpara, Dr Sam Mbakwe and former Cross River State Governor, Donald Duke, would probably not have emerged to transform their respective region and states, if zoning was ideal.\n\nWith Dr Okpara\u2019s \u201cPragmatic Socialist Manifesto\u201d, Umuahia would have been like paradise today if he were to be a product of zoning. This is because, the myopic sentiment of zoning wouldn\u2019t have allowed him to develop the economy of the East. He would have probably concentrated the entire developments to Umuahia in order to pursue the sectional ideology of zoning. But this is not so due to the fact that his ascendancy to the Premiership was expressed in the loudest voice of liberal democracy.\n\nDr Okpara to me is a perfect example of liberal democrat. Anyone who admires Dr Okpara\u2019s \u201cPragmatic Socialism\u201d should see why zoning is an impediment to even-development.\n\nSadly, many people, especially from Enugu, had thought and at some point, believed that political office \u2018turn-taking\u2019 is an ingenious political invention to harmonize the discourse of complex situation of leadership. But this is not so given to the fact that zoning had only succeeded in widening the gap of quality representation.\n\nIt should be well understood by all and sundry that zoning is purely idea of the elites, not the people. The effects which have culminated in the recycling of elite parochialism, relegation of viable leadership ideas and brandishing of unnecessary ethnic identities in a supposedly secular state. This should no longer be allowed to thrive in a society now filled with technocrats.\n\nI therefore appeal to Ndi Enugu to expunge from our minds, the concept of zoning, as it is the worse form of perverted democracy and antithetical to progressive ideas. Zoning is a rigged system \u2014 it is like \u201cannouncing the result of election that has not been conducted\u201d \u2014 a subterfuge to lure our people into franchise although the winner is already known. One may ask, why then waste the state resources on electoral exercise that will eventually produce a zoning arrangement?\n\nThis is why in the year 2023, Ndi Enugu must think big first. We shall not allow the illusion of zoning take the place of the majority interest. Let\u2019s extricate ourselves from the fetters of zoning which obviously, is no longer sustainable to development. We can begin today to readdress our political thoughts and orientation as we aspire for a better society anchored on competence, competition and merit. A society where the will and aspiration of our people will be prioritized over minority interest.

          "title": "Opinion: Zoning: A distraction from liberal democracy \u2014 Why Enugu should think big first \u2013 By ROBERT AJAH",
          "text": "With her own peculiar challenges, Nigeria has struggled for a place in history to emerge as Africa Democracy. This struggle began many years ago with the military, sabotaging the spirit of the struggle. However, the struggle continued and had managed to survive two decades of democratic dispensation without capitulation. There is hope therefore, that we can secure our rightful place in history as the pride of Africa Democracy. But to reach this milestone, we need to articulate our principles according to best practices, and shun every temptation of mediocrity.\n\nTo be candid, for our society to attain the true goal of democracy as in civilized societies, myopic views as zoning and sectionalism, must be bundled and thrown into the waste bin. The reason this must be done is simple \u2014 democracy as the best form of government, is conceived on the principle of \u2018majority interest\u2019 or simply say, majority rule. It is not a rule by the minority for which zoning is predicated on \u2014the dictates of the minority interest\u2014 the elites.\n\nZoning had not only contradicted the idea of majority interest, it had also undermined even-development and diversification of economy of Enugu State. As could be seen from recent Enugu State leaderships, zoning arrangement only benefitted the sections where the leaders emerged from instead of the state as a whole. As a distorted view of democracy, zoning promotes sectional parochialism since the leaders prioritized their zones for developments to the exclusion of other parts of the state.\n\nSo, I think that the sentiment for zoning has created a system of injustice on the allocation of resources and execution of key infrastructures in the state. Had Enugu sticked to the idea of liberal democracy, by now every part of the state would have developed reasonably on equal scale including my own village, Okpanku.\n\nMeanwhile, the proponents of zoning had almost made the theory look like a solution to leadership quagmire, but a conscious look into the arrangement will unravel its ugly side as impediment to even-development. In other words, if zoning is remedial to Enugu political tussle, why is it that the zones where the leaders emerged from are better developed than others? We can confidently see that zoning as panacea to power equation, has done a great injustice to the developmental goals of the state. This is why I think zoning is a total distraction from liberal democracy whose primary dividend is inclusive governance.\n\nAs a reminder, the likes of Dr Michael Okpara, Dr Sam Mbakwe and former Cross River State Governor, Donald Duke, would probably not have emerged to transform their respective region and states, if zoning was ideal.\n\nWith Dr Okpara\u2019s \u201cPragmatic Socialist Manifesto\u201d, Umuahia would have been like paradise today if he were to be a product of zoning. This is because, the myopic sentiment of zoning wouldn\u2019t have allowed him to develop the economy of the East. He would have probably concentrated the entire developments to Umuahia in order to pursue the sectional ideology of zoning. But this is not so due to the fact that his ascendancy to the Premiership was expressed in the loudest voice of liberal democracy.\n\nDr Okpara to me is a perfect example of liberal democrat. Anyone who admires Dr Okpara\u2019s \u201cPragmatic Socialism\u201d should see why zoning is an impediment to even-development.\n\nSadly, many people, especially from Enugu, had thought and at some point, believed that political office \u2018turn-taking\u2019 is an ingenious political invention to harmonize the discourse of complex situation of leadership. But this is not so given to the fact that zoning had only succeeded in widening the gap of quality representation.\n\nIt should be well understood by all and sundry that zoning is purely idea of the elites, not the people. The effects which have culminated in the recycling of elite parochialism, relegation of viable leadership ideas and brandishing of unnecessary ethnic identities in a supposedly secular state. This should no longer be allowed to thrive in a society now filled with technocrats.\n\nI therefore appeal to Ndi Enugu to expunge from our minds, the concept of zoning, as it is the worse form of perverted democracy and antithetical to progressive ideas. Zoning is a rigged system \u2014 it is like \u201cannouncing the result of election that has not been conducted\u201d \u2014 a subterfuge to lure our people into franchise although the winner is already known. One may ask, why then waste the state resources on electoral exercise that will eventually produce a zoning arrangement?\n\nThis is why in the year 2023, Ndi Enugu must think big first. We shall not allow the illusion of zoning take the place of the majority interest. Let\u2019s extricate ourselves from the fetters of zoning which obviously, is no longer sustainable to development. We can begin today to readdress our political thoughts and orientation as we aspire for a better society anchored on competence, competition and merit. A society where the will and aspiration of our people will be prioritized over minority interest. For us to engrave our name in this golden age of democratic dispensation, we must shun mediocrity and sectional political interest.\n\nO Ajah Esq.\n\nLawyer and Advocate of Good Governance, writes in from Enugu, Nigeria\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Alkasim Abdulkadir provides rare insight into the fight against insurgency, nation building and why Nigerian youths must chase money",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: How special needs students are struggling against the Nigerian educational system",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 5\n\nBy: Olatunji Olaigbe\n\nOn the 20th of March, 2021, Jamiu Jibril, a visually impaired student sat to write his Master\u2019s entrance examination at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ilorin. He had an aid who read out the questions and wrote down his answers for him, and like the non-special needs student sitting for the exam, he was given two and half hours.\n\nThroughout Jibril\u2019s academic journey, he has had to depend on the goodwill of other students and his extra-thrust for knowledge to go through school. The University of Ilorin, the same tertiary institution he got his graduate degree from, never provided him with special needs resources.\n\nHe remembers going to the university\u2019s center for special students one day and being told \u201cthe center was for deaf students, and not the blind. Everything I did, every assistance I got, was on me,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nLike Jibril, special needs students in Nigerian tertiary institutions struggle against myriads of problems in the quest for education.\n\nIn a research by Abubakar Ahmed, Zakaria Al-Cheikh Mahmoud Awad, and Mastura Adam; Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and Kano University of Science and Technology (KUST) were scored 26.7% and 13.3% respectively in their accessibility to the mobility impaired, noting: \u201cOnly 272 special schools, homes, centers, and integrated school cater for the education of Special needs children in Nigeria; a country whose Persons living With Disability (PWD) population was put at 19 million. Only 10% of the over 19 million disabled are receiving education in Nigerian educational environment.\u201d\n\nThe 272 represents a totality of both special needs institutions, built specifically for special needs students, and seemingly \u201cinclusive\u201d institutions \u2013 meaning they provide education for non-special needs and special needs students. But how true is the statement?\n\nIn the University of Ibadan, the department of special education is a two-storey building with no ramps or supportive devices for special students other than the auditorily impaired. This makes it hard for students with other forms of disability to move around the building, getting education.\n\nTola Alli, NewsWire.\n\n\u201cMobility impaired students have to stick to the lower floors and in unavoidable cases, they have to find someone who can assist them up the stairs\u201d, says Nimi, a student of the department. \u201cEven non-disabled students have issues getting education in the University, imagine what it\u2019s like having a disability with that.\u201d\n\nThe presence of PWDs in an institution does not directly translate into true inclusivity. Most institutions lack resources and infrastructure for special needs students. For Jibril, who has visited several institutions while representing his faculty, the University of Jos is the most special needs-friendly institution he\u2019s seen, scoring 50% by his own discretion. \u201cThe University of Lagos could be scoring 80%, because they have a lot of resources and infrastructure, but they lack the motive to use these resources.\u201d\n\nA special needs-friendly institution for an auditorily impaired student can still be non-friendly to a mobility impaired, or a visually impaired student.\n\nIn the university of Benue, Akin, an auditorily-impaired student struggles in comprehending what is being taught because the university has no audio-to-sign language interpreter.\n\nAt the University of Ilorin, Victor, another auditorily impaired student of Computer Science Education faces a different shade of the same problem. The University of Ilorin provides interpreters, \u201cbut there are not enough,\u201d says Victor. Citing that this places a lot of stress on the available interpreters. He added, \u201csometimes, the available interpreter is not familiar with me or the course being taught, [and then] misinterpretations happen.\u201d For him, just as it is for every other student, getting what is being taught right is the tiny margin between a hardworking student and an intelligent one.\n\nQuoting the answers to research questions by Education Data, Research, and Evaluation Nigeria (EDOREN):\n\nThe schools have facilities that meet the needs of all learners, such as separate toilets for girls, ramps (not stairs) for learners with physical disabilities and tactile floor guide: NO\n\n\u201cTeachers have high expectations for ALL children, believe they all can learn and encourage them to complete school: NO\n\nTeachers know about the conditions that cause physical, emotional, and learning disabilities; and can help learners to get proper care: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nLearners are involved to actively participate and develop guidelines/rules in the school to improve inclusion, reduce discrimination, violence and abuse: NO\u201d.\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nIn place of the margin between literate and non-literate PWDs in Nigeria, the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) implemented a policy encouraging institutions to make 10% of their population PWDs, \u201cbut I can assure you that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria introduced the National Policy on Special Needs Education, its first document fully dedicated to the interests of people with special needs.\n\nIn 2016, it also introduced the National Policy on Inclusive Education, which aimed to provide education to everyone. Promising to \u201coffer a quality education for all while respecting diversity\u201d. The policy defined itself as \u201cabout removing barriers to learning and involving all learners who otherwise would have been excluded through marginalization and segregation.\u201d\n\nOn 17th, January 2019, President Muhammed Buhari signed the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act \u2013 even promising the conversion of existing building structures into inclusive ones.\n\nBut most of these policies are lost in transition, not being translated into actions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for more inclusivity policies, but more need for the enforcing of already existing policies. There\u2019s a need for institutions to improve on their inclusivity.\u201d says Dr. Azubike Onuora-Oguno, a Teaching Research Fellow on Human Rights Law and Society at the International Institute of Social Sciences, Netherlands. And a senior project manager of the Disability Law Advocacy Project \u2013 an Open Society Initiative of West Africa (OSIWA) project aimed to make academic curriculums in Nigerian Universities special needs friendly.\n\nThe majority of problems come from the government, but the public has a part to play too. \u201cWe all have an obligation to accommodate PWDs, but this can\u2019t happen until we understand the concept. Parents, people have to understand that PWDs are humans, meant to be acknowledged as such,\u201d says Dr. Azuibike. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s a need for deep-seated sensitization that will make us act reasonably towards PWDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need understanding, EMPATHY, not SYMPATHY,\u201d types Abiola Dada, a special needs student at the University of Ilorin.\n\nJibril is a broadcaster at Royal FM, Ilorin, and when Jibril isn\u2019t busy with work or academics, he tutors other students in his Faculty. \u201cOn most days, the university is crowded. There\u2019s the bus fight, students literally gnawing their way through the queue. What happens to me? Do I sleep in school?\u201d Asks Jibril.",

          "title": "Murder in Uyo: Who Killed Hiny Umoren?",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 15\n\nOn Friday April 29, a 26 year-old lady set out around 1PM to attend a job interview in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Having recently completed her university program despite losing both parents, she was looking for a way to support herself before being called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) program.\n\nInstead of a job interview and hope for the future however, what she would actually encounter on that day would become one of the most shocking stories to ever emerge from Nigeria.\n\nY'all my friend @HinyHumoren is in trouble and she needs our help.\n\nI'm currently in Lagos and I can't help than to put this out there.\n\nEarlier today she told me she was going for a job interview at airport road which is quite far from her house. pic.twitter.com/X1YBLUPO7d \u2014 Happiness Activist #justiceforHinyUmoren (@UmohUduak1) April 29, 2021\n\nIniobong \u201cHiny\u201d Umoren became the subject of a desperate nationwide search led by Nigerian Twitter users after her friend Umoh Uduak put out an urgent appeal. She was eventually found, but unfortunately the worst had already happened. The police would later confirm that she was found dead, having been raped, murdered and then buried in a shallow grave.\n\nIn the wake of a crowdsourced social media sleuthing campaign which uncovered his identity, a primary suspect Frank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan was also arrested.\n\nIn a manner completely uncharacteristic of Nigeria\u2019s elephant-paced justice system, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command rapidly announced that it had extracted a confession from Akpan, and even identified his motive \u2013 he was a serial rapist and serial killer acting alone. End of story and job done.\n\nNaturally, this neat explanation did not satisfy many, who felt that Akpan could not have acted alone, and that the police might be involved in some kind of a cover up to protect powerful people potentially implicated. Rumours also began swirling about Hiny\u2019s family receiving death threats, and the suspect allegedly boasting about being well-connected.\n\nBeyond the whispers however, there has been precious little to substantiate the idea that stringing up Frank Akpan alone would not represent any kind of justice for Hiny Umoren. Sources willing to speak up and provide information about this case have generally not been forthcoming.\n\nUntil now.\n\nGame Changing Information\n\nEvery telephone conversation made via a GSM telephone line has a permanent record with the mobile service provider, which by law cannot be tampered with or erased. The information captured can vary, but it always includes the following elements: the date and time the interaction was initiated; the type of interaction (voice or SMS); the length of the interaction; the number initiating the interaction; the number receiving the interaction and the location of the closest cell towers to both parties.\n\nSome networks also record the actual conversation (voice note), and depending on the type of signal band and mobile device, it is even possible to capture the exact location of both parties, accurate to within a few metres. Anyone who can get their hands on the call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s line would very quickly be able to establish whether he was in fact acting alone \u2013 which is where my source came in handy.\n\nUnderstandably, this information is meant to be impossible to access without law enforcement authorisation. With this in mind, I have taken the extra precaution of reproducing it manually via a spreadsheet, so as to protect my source by removing all possible identifying information. Over the course of several hours last week, I pored over several days worth of leaked call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s mobile provider to make sense of the situation.\n\nWhat will be presented in this story is the closest thing that exists to objective evidence that:\n\n1.) Frank Akpan is being used to take the fall for much bigger fish involved in Hiny Umoren\u2019s murder; and\n\n2.) While Frank Akpan is certainly the primary suspect and was directly involved in the murder, there are other participants in the murder still walking free, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command intentionally bungles what should be an open and shut investigation.\n\nWho is Frank Akpan?\n\nApart from a few tidbits pieced together from social media accounts about him, very little is known about Frank Akpan the primary suspect. The timeline to his arrest begins late in the afternoon on April 29, when Umoh puts out Hiny\u2019s number hoping someone will be able to track down her friend\u2019s location.\n\nThe mention of \u201cFrank Akpan\u201d as a central figure in this story begins with this tweet from Umoh which identifies the owner of the Airtel number +2348127530092 as the person who invited Hiny for the supposed interview.\n\nA quick check with Truecaller brings up the name \u201cEzekiel Akpan.\u201d Curiously, the occupation tag on this person\u2019s Truecaller profile reads \u201cPolitical.\u201d It is important to bear in mind that Truecaller fills an individual\u2019s \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018occupation\u2019 fields by pulling high quality data from several sources including Facebook profile information and analysis of the individual\u2019s Facebook friend networks \u2013 so this tiny detail will become significant later on.\n\nShortly after finding himself under instant national scrutiny following Umoh\u2019s tweet, Akpan then attempts to throw the public off the scent with the Facebook post below. In so doing, he inadvertently confirms that the telephone number in question is actually his, thereby proving that \u201cUduak Frank Akpan\u201d and \u201cEzekiel Akpan\u201d are the same person.\n\nShortly thereafter, he deactivates his Facebook profile and seemingly goes silent until the Akwa Ibom State Police Command issues a statement 3 days later, confirming his arrest and effectively pronouncing him guilty of the crime as a sole suspect.\n\nFrank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan\n\nSo far, based on the version of the story that is in official circulation, there is only Frank Akpan and the unfortunate Hiny Umoren. The police have declared him a serial rapist \u2013 and hence a single actor. Officially, the issue is over and there is nothing more to see here. It was just a horrible monster and a woman who unfortunately fell victim under the most heartbreaking circumstances.\n\nThe only counter-story so far boils down to a few unsubstantiated social media rumours that cannot stand in court, plus what would otherwise be compelling evidence from Akpan\u2019s crime scene, which unfortunately has now been contaminated and rendered all but useless for the purpose of a criminal investigation.\n\nUduak Frank Akpan specialized in luring and kidnapping job seekers, youth Corp members, students and pupils, killing them, cutting off their sensitive parts, bury them in shallow graves then exhume their bones after decaying to sell off for more rituals#JusticeForHinyUmoren pic.twitter.com/BeexbP11wf \u2014 DR.PENKING\u2122 #JusticeForHinyUmoren (@drpenking) May 7, 2021\n\nBy deliberate malfeasance or by incompetence, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has allowed key evidence from Akpan\u2019s hideout potentially pointing to a larger conspiracy, to be trampled underfoot by hundreds of curious onlookers and social media content creators. In so doing, the evidence to build a case for anything other than a standalone Frank Akpan conviction has been destroyed or rendered inadmissible.\n\nThere is however, one type of evidence that cannot be physically destroyed or tampered with in any way. This evidence has a permanent digital record which sits in cloud storage away from the incompetence or malfeasance of the Nigeria Police Force, and what it shows without a shadow of doubt is that Frank Akpan did not act alone.\n\nLeaked Network Records: The Smoking Gun\n\nTo properly understand and contextualise the data that you are about to see below, a little explainer is in order. As mentioned earlier, the 6 categories of telephone interaction data always recorded by service providers are call date and time, originating number, receiving number, type of interaction (call or SMS), length of interaction (in seconds) and the originating/receiving cell tower.\n\nEvery cell tower on earth has a unique location code written in this format: MCC (Mobile Country Code)-MNC (Mobile Network Code)-LAC (Location Area Code)-CellID. Nigeria\u2019s mobile country code is 621, and its 4 largest network providers MTN, Glo, Airtel and 9Mobile have the respective MNCs 30, 50, 20 and 60. Using this information alongside the LAC and CellID provided in the call records below, you can pinpoint the exact cell tower closest to where the call in question was made or received.\n\nFor example, if the given MCC is 621, the MNC is 20 (Airtel), the LAC is 00784, and the CellID is 20565, you can put this information into free public access cell site locators like cell2gps.com and the result will be a cell tower site in Uyo at the junction of Ikot-Ekpene road and Ikpa Road.\n\nThis is actual cell site data from a call made by Frank Akpan at 6.50PM on April 29, 2021\n\nThat being said, it is time to examine the leaked call record data and draw our conclusions. First, here is data I extracted from what my source provided, showing the significant parts of Frank Akpan\u2019s call and SMS history on the day Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nFor ease of understanding, I ran all the numbers through Truecaller and put the names in brackets next to them\n\nAround 1.17PM on April 29, Frank Akpan placed a call to Hiny Umoren, which lasted for 124 seconds. It is fair to extrapolate that this was a call where he gave directions to her regarding where she should go for the purported interview. At 1.21PM, he then placed a call to a Blessing Godwin, which lasted 147 seconds. Was he chatting up another potential victim of the same job interview snare? It is impossible to say for now.\n\nAt 3:38PM, Hiny Umoren then placed a call to Frank Akpan lasting for 106 seconds. If you compare the cell tower data here to that of his previous phone calls, it is clear that he was already at the supposed venue waiting for her because the tower location does not change. It is safe to assume that she was calling to tell him that she had arrived for her interview. Save for a 2-second WhatsApp voice note which Hiny later managed to send to Umoh, this call was probably the last time anyone ever heard Hiny Umoren alive again.\n\nAround 6.15PM, almost 3 hours after Hiny Umoren arrived at his lair, Frank Akpan then placed a call to an unknown number. The call records clearly show +2348127530092 \u2013 Frank Akpan\u2019s known public number \u2013 making repeated contact between 6.15PM and 6.50PM with +2348122386922, an unknown number which brings up no details on Truecaller or Facebook. For reference, if a mobile number pulls up no Truecaller, Facebook or social media results whatsoever, this could either mean that it is used on a non-internet-enabled feature phone (a so-called \u2018burner\u2019 phone), or that the owner is extremely intentional about having no digital footprint linked to that number.\n\nIncidentally, this was also around the time when the Twitter hashtag #FindHinyUmoren had already led Twitter sleuths to uncover Frank Akpan\u2019s identity, leading to his amateur attempt at misdirection referenced earlier. In the middle of a clear and obvious crisis moment, why was Frank Akpan repeatedly trying to establish contact with this unknown number with no digital footprint? The answer could lie in some data I extracted from a different set of call records showing Frank Akpan\u2019s contact with this number in the days and weeks before Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nThis unknown person contacted Frank Akpan no fewer than 12 times between April 4 and April 27\n\nWas this a regular buyer or facilitator of whatever gruesome trade Frank Akpan was involved in? Was Frank calling him for help after an unexpected social media campaign suddenly exposed him and put their entire business operation at risk? Why was this the first number that Frank called immediately after raping and murdering a young woman? We do not know the answers to these questions, but there is at least one person other than Frank Akpan himself who can probably tell us.\n\nThe \u201cSenior Forestry Officer\u201d\n\nIt is April 30, 2021, and Frank Akpan has become a nationwide hate figure on social media. His involvement in Hiny Umoren\u2019s disappearance is public knowledge at this point, and time is running out for him. He needs friends and allies to protect him \u2013 and fast. His name and picture are doing the rounds on social media, and in a city like Uyo, it will not be long before someone recognises him and he finds himself subjected to Nigerian street justice.\n\nBetween 10.27Am and 10.44AM, he places 3 phone calls to a Francisca Bassey Akpan \u2013 Francisca is in Calabar when she receives the calls, and she is using a smartphone in a location with high network capacity, which means the network is able to record her location while receiving Frank\u2019s calls to within a few metres of accuracy.\n\nAt 10.55AM, Francisca calls Frank back. Only they and the mobile network know what is said during this 51-second conversation. My source balked at the idea of obtaining customer voice notes because that would simply be a bridge too far, even for the sake of solving a brutal murder. Just getting this much information to me is already breaking multiple in-house rules and NCC codes, so they understandably did not want to push their luck.\n\nAt 4.32PM on April 30, Frank then makes one of the most most interesting phone calls in this entire story. Truecaller pulls up the details of the recipient of the phone call with the number +23480*****326 \u2013 one \u201cKufre Effiong.\u201d Unlike the other people Frank has been known to associate with, Kufre Effiong appears to be from a different world. He is significantly older than Frank and as his location details show, he lives in the swanky part of town. Who is this guy?\n\nTheir conversation lasts for just 31 seconds and presumably ends with Kufre hanging up. Frank\u2019s phone rings almost immediately at 4.34PM. The caller is +234803*****19 and this conversation lasts decidedly longer than the last one \u2013 almost 4 minutes. Who is the owner of this number that has so much to talk about with someone who is probably Nigeria\u2019s most wanted man at the moment? Truecaller answers once again.\n\nKufre Effiong is an older, wealthier looking man who apparently spends his time in the upscale Ewet Estate while Frank Akpan rapes and murders young women in uncompleted buildings somewhere across town.\n\nWhat could these two possibly have in common that brings them together? Interestingly, if you compare the location data from both calls, it is clear that both men have in fact met physically at a certain 58G, Ewet Housing Estate in Uyo. Frank is probably outside the building talking to this older, wiser man on the phone and hoping to get some help from him.\n\nMore on 58G, Ewet Housing Estate later.\n\nWho exactly is Kufre Effiong? I eventually found the answer after scrolling through dozens, maybe hundreds of social media profiles with that exact name. Mr Effiong as it turns out, is something of a big fish in Niger Delta civil service circles.\n\nNow back to the address where both men met. Plot 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is home to the Uyo branch office of a medical NGO called the Center for Clinical Care and Research (CCCR Nigeria).\n\nFounded in 2010 by an all-star list of accomplished Nigerian-American doctors, CCCR carries out medical outreach programs in underserved areas of Nigeria and promotes medical best practices using a fusion of global best practices and local healthcare delivery models. Or at least it used to, because as far as it is possible to tell, its social media pages have had no activity whatsoever since 2017. A scan of news stories since 2017 using the keywords \u201cCCCR Nigeria\u201d and \u201cCenter for Clinical Care and Research Nigeria\u201d turns up nothing.\n\nAnd yet, at least if Google is to be believed, its Uyo branch office at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate still opens at 8.30AM everyday and closes at 5PM. This exact address also happens to be where Kufre Effiong made and received calls from Frank Akpan, who also physically met him there 24 hours after raping and murdering Hiny Umoren.\n\nBlack market value of human organs | Source: Gizmodo\n\nDue to the convoluted house numbering system in Uyo, the property labeled as 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is also recognised on most digital maps as Plot S.9, Unit G, Ewet Housing Estate. That address is also home to Davok Suites, which is a popular upmarket hotel in Uyo favoured by high profile guests including the Cameroon national team.\n\nThis would be the ideal location for a trusted associate of a politician \u2013 say, a senior civil servant \u2013 to lay his head while running a clandestine errand for his boss.\n\nAn errand such as sourcing human parts for use in a ritual sacrifice ahead of the upcoming election season, for example. Whatever it is that happened or is happening at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate \u2013 and for whose benefit \u2013 is a question only Kufre Effiong can answer. Cavernous as this story has become, there is still one more twist.\n\nHiny Umoren\u2019s Murder \u2013 A Police Cover Up In Progress\n\nAt the outset, I referenced a press release from the Akwa Ibom State Command on May 2 patting themselves on the back for arresting Frank Akpan and solving a huge criminal conspiracy in 5 minutes by pinning everything on him. One of the names singled out for praise in the press release for his alleged role in apprehending Frank Akpan was a certain SP Samuel Ezeugo.\n\nOn April 30, at 4.40PM, Frank Akpan placed a call to someone with the number +2348034386086.\n\nSecond from bottom\n\nAt this point, I trust it will not shock you to know that when I ran this number through Truecaller, the name that came up was none other than\u2026\n\nThe one and the same.\n\nIn other words, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command is releasing statements claiming to be solving a crime by arresting a suspect, the suspect was actually making telephone calls to one of the police officers who would later \u201carrest\u201d him, and speaking to him for a minute and a half. What were they talking about? Perhaps Frank Akpan \u2013 who was still at large at the time \u2013 was giving SP Ezeugo instructions for how to apprehend him nicely?\n\nEven more conveniently, Akpan placed the call to SP Ezeugo less than a minute after receiving a text message from Kufre Effiong. While still physically located at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate.\n\nIn other words, the senior civil servant working at the Niger Delta Ministry probably sent SP Ezeugo\u2019s phone number to Akpan via SMS, with instructions to call him and let him \u201chandle\u201d it.\n\nAnd most tellingly of all, SP Ezeugo\u2019s cell tower location data indicates that while all this was happening, he was in close range of a cell tower near the entrance of Ewet Housing Estate. Presumably, on his way to meet oga.\n\nTake note of the cell tower\u2019s location next to General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nFor comparison, look at Ewet Housing Estate vis-a-vis General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nSo putting the entire picture together, we have what appears to be a well-connected criminal gang in Akwa Ibom with links to the police and the Federal Ministry of the Niger Delta, which probably specialises in sourcing human organs either for the purpose of selling to the international black market or to service local politicians who believe in ritual human sacrifice.\n\nBy the accident of targeting someone with significant social media capital, the existence of this organisation is threatened, and so the Akwa Ibom Police Command is allegedly being used to actively bungle and mishandle the case.\n\nFinding the individual who owns the telephone number +2348*******22 is central to unraveling the mystery of why Iniobong Umoren had to die, how many more like her have died in the past, and most importantly, who are the big fish behind the entire operation. Exactly what is going on at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is another key question that must be answered.\n\nIf Frank Akpan won\u2019t talk, maybe Kufre Effiong can tell us.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated in view of fresh facts.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

They\u2019ve lost four finals and now a fifth time we\u2019ve managed to do it for them.\u201d\n\nA historic week for Rodgers\u2019s men could get even better as they are on the verge of sealing a place in next season\u2019s Champions League.\n\nThe sides meet again in three days\u2019 time at Stamford Bridge in a pivotal clash to decide who secures a top-four finish in the Premier League.\n\nAnd Rodgers suggested his side were the neutrals favourites as they aim to upset the applecart of the Premier League\u2019s \u2018big six\u2019 once more.\n\nChelsea were among the clubs to sign up to the failed, quasi-closed European Super League (ESL) project last month, along with Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal.\n\n\u201cThe success of this team and club is getting to positions like this and competing. The so-called bigger clubs are expected to win but our success is competing and if we can perform like today we can go and win,\u201d added Rodgers.\n\n\u201cAfter everything that has happened this year, I\u2019m sure there were people hoping from a neutral perspective that we could go on and upset the odds.\u201d\n\nChelsea need a quick response after losing for just the fourth time in 27 games since Thomas Tuchel replaced the sacked Frank Lampard in January.\n\nThe Blues also have a Champions League final to look forward to against Manchester City in two weeks\u2019 time, but could end the campaign without silverware or a place in Europe\u2019s premier club competition next season.\n\n\u201cOf course we are disappointed but we are not angry,\u201d said Tuchel. \u201cThis performance was enough to win it, today we are simply unlucky. You need luck in this game to be able to win\u201d\n\nVAR to the rescue\n\nChelsea\u2019s success under Tuchel has come thanks to an excellent defensive record, but their struggles at the other end were again exposed as they rarely threatened until going behind.\n\nThe welcome return of noise echoing down from 6,000 fans of each side from both ends of the ground helped mask a general lack of quality on the field for the first hour.\n\nOne moment of magic proved decisive as Tielemans collected possession midway inside the Chelsea half and strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable strike into the top corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n\nTuchel flexed the strength in depth of his squad in an attempt to find an equaliser as Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz, Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic were all introduced off the bench.\n\nBut they were denied by the brilliance of Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester goal.\n\nChilwell, whose every touch was booed by the Leicester support, twice nearly came back to haunt his old club as his first effort was turned onto the post by the Dane.\n\nMason Mount then could not believe his luck as his sweetly struck shot was turned behind by a brilliant stop from Schmeichel.\n\nEven when the Leicester \u2018keeper was beaten, Chelsea were denied by a VAR review.\n\nWes Morgan\u2019s attempted clearance deflected in off Chilwell, but the England international had strayed offside in the build-up.\n\n\u201cThank you VAR! What an amazing technology,\u201d said Tielemans.\n\nLeicester players and fans celebrated the decision like a goal and were in raptures again moments later after seeing out a nervy finale.",

          "title": "Chelsea, Leicester Clash at Wembley in Mouthwatering FA Cup Final \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Coaches Thomas Tuchel and Brendan Rodgers will battle it out to try to win their first trophy in English football when Chelsea and Leicester City meet in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final at Wembley.\n\nIt\u2019s a game that will see two of the Premier League\u2019s top teams face off to win the oldest cup competition in football, with the FA Cup first contested in 1871-72.\n\nChelsea are aiming to win their ninth FA Cup (and seventh this century), which would put them clear in third on the all-time list behind Manchester United (12) and Arsenal (14). Leicester, who stunned the football world by winning the 2015-16 Premier League title, go into their first FA Cup final since 1969 looking to win it for the first time.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time since 2007, when title winners Man United lost to league runners-up Chelsea, that the final will be contested by two teams in the top four, so it promises to be an evenly balanced game with no clear favourite.\n\nLeicester are third in the Premier League, two points ahead of Chelsea, heading into the final week of the league season, and there is little to separate the two sides in recent form. Over the last 10 league games, Chelsea sit third in the form table with six wins, two draws and two defeats. Leicester are fifth having won five, drawn twice and lost three times.\n\nA 2-0 defeat at Leicester in January proved to be Frank Lampard\u2019s last league game as Chelsea manager; he was sacked less than a week later and replaced by Thomas Tuchel. Coincidentally, the two teams meet again in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge next Tuesday in a game that will be crucial for Champions League qualification.\n\nTuchel started the season in charge of Paris Saint-Germain before being sacked in December, but he could finish the campaign by guiding Chelsea to success in the FA Cup and Champions League.\n\nWhen Tuchel replaced Lampard in mid-January, Chelsea were ninth in the Premier League and losing ground on the top four, but he\u2019s overseen a dramatic transformation with 17 victories and three defeats in his 26 games in all competitions.\n\nTuchel won domestic cups in Germany and France with Borussia Dortmund and PSG, and he\u2019s elevated Chelsea, bringing defensive solidity (18 clean sheets in 26 games) and coaxing much-improved form out of expensive forwards Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, as well as restoring defenders Antonio Rudiger and Marcos Alonso to the team.\n\nUnder Tuchel, Chelsea eliminated Man City at the semifinal stage and also beat Pep Guardiola\u2019s team, whom they will also face in the Champions League final in Portugal on May 29, in the Premier League last week.\n\nLeicester were 11th in the Premier League and closer to the relegation zone than the top four when Rodgers left Celtic to replace Claude Puel in February 2019. Since then, Leicester have been on an upwards trajectory, winning 57 of Rodgers\u2019 108 games in charge. They finished fifth last season and on course to improve on that this time around.\n\nRodgers has brought stylish football to the King Power Stadium, and also turned the club into the one most likely to break up the so-called \u201cBig Six.\u201d He has revived the career of 34-year-old striker Jamie Vardy and has improved emerging stars such as James Maddison, Kelechi Iheanacho, Harvey Barnes and Youri Tielemans.\n\nThe former Liverpool manager won seven major honours in less than three years at Celtic, but he has yet to win a trophy in English football. Lifting the FA Cup would be a huge boost to his reputation and put him in contention for bigger jobs in the Premier League and Europe.\n\nHaving been overlooked consistently by Lampard, playing just nine games, Rudiger has been crucial to Chelsea\u2019s revival under Tuchel. In 19 league games without the German defender, Chelsea have conceded 26 goals, but they have shipped just seven in the 17 games he has started. Rudiger was rested for Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 defeat against Arsenal but is expected to be fit to take his place at centre-back against Leicester.\n\nFormer Leicester midfielder N\u2019Golo Kante is another key man for Chelsea, while the recent attacking form of Christian Pulisic and Havertz make them big players for Tuchel.\n\nJonny Evans is similarly important to Leicester, but the former Man United defender has a 50-50 chance to play due to a heel injury that forced him to miss the team\u2019s last two games. The 33-year-old is regarded as the glue that holds Leicester\u2019s defence together, meaning his absence would be a major blow.\n\nLeicester will need Maddison and Tielemans on form in midfield and hope that former Man City striker Iheanacho can extend a run that has seen him score 13 goals in his last 12 games.\n\nSeveral clubs have lost more finals than Leicester \u2014 Manchester United and Everton share the unenviable record of having lost eight \u2014 but those teams have all won the cup on at least once. Leicester have made it to four FA Cup finals and lost them all \u2014 in 1949, 1961, 1963 and 1969 \u2014 which gives them the distinction of most final appearances without lifting the trophy.\n\nRecent history is also against Leicester. Of the last 25 finals, only two (Portsmouth 2008, Wigan 2013) have been won by clubs outside the so-called \u201cBig Six.\u201d During that period, Arsenal (8), Chelsea (7), Man Utd (4), Man City (2) and Liverpool (2) have dominated. Tottenham, the other \u201cBig Six\u201d team, haven\u2019t won the FA Cup since 1991.\n\nA crowd of 21,000, the largest in England since COVID-19 restrictions were imposed in March 2020, will be attending. An attendance of 8,000 was allowed for the Carabao Cup final at Wembley between Man City and Tottenham last month and, with that proving a success, the crowd limit has been raised for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nSupporters will not need to have been vaccinated to gain entry, but they will have to provide a negative COVID-19 test within 36 hours of kick-off.\n\nThe game is designated as a test event by the UK government and the success, or otherwise, will influence the number of fans allowed to watch Euro 2020 games at Wembley in June and July.\n\nSource: ESPN",

But City replied with a quick double \u2013 Joao Cancelo and Torres\u2019 superb first strike firing the champions in front.\n\nBut there was more VAR drama to come in the first half. In the second minute of injury time, Nathan Ake\u2019s clumsy challenge saw Joelinton fouled in the area. Referee Kevin Friend initially turned down the penalty after Allan Saint-Maximin was adjudged to be offside in the build-up, but VAR ruled the Newcastle forward onside and the penalty was subsequently awarded. Joelinton then hammered home from the spot to level things up before the break.The second half continued in the same topsy-turvy vein.\n\nNewcastle were awarded another spot-kick just after the hour as Kyle Walker fouled Joe Willock. It was the Arsenal loanee who stepped up for the second, seeing his penalty saved by Carson but slotting home the rebound, scoring in his fifth successive Premier League game.\n\nBut Torres completed his hat-trick soon after both smart finishes, much like his first \u2013 to seal a hard-earned three points for Man City.\n\nIt was their 12th successive away win in the Premier League \u2013 the most in the top four tiers of English league football \u2013 and beat the record held by Chelsea (2008) and themselves (2017).\n\nThe victory moves City onto 83 points at the top of the table, while a spirited Newcastle remain in 16th with both teams having two league games left to play.",

          "text": "Israeli planes renewed air strikes in Gaza early on Saturday and Hamas militants responded by firing rockets into Israel as their battle entered a fifth night and US and Arab diplomats sought an end to the violence.\n\nPalestinian medics said at least 12 people were killed overnight in air strikes throughout Gaza. Health officials said a woman and her three children were among the dead after their house was hit in a refugee camp.\n\nThe Israeli military said it carried out strikes on a Hamas military intelligence facility and a number of rocket launching sites in northern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian religious affairs ministry said Israeli planes destroyed a mosque. A military spokesman said the army was checking the report.\n\nAcross the border, sirens sounded throughout much of southern Israel, sending residents running for shelter. In the cities of Beersheba and Ashdod buildings were struck by rockets. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nWith no sign of an end to the fighting, casualties spread further afield, with Palestinians reporting on Friday 11 killed in the occupied West Bank amid clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces.\n\nAt least 132 people have been killed in Gaza since Monday, including 32 children and 21 women, and 950 others wounded, Palestinian medical officials said.\n\nAmong the eight dead in Israel were a soldier patrolling the Gaza border and six civilians, including two children, Israeli authorities said.\n\nAhead of a session of the UN Security Council on Sunday to discuss the situation, Biden administration envoy Hady Amr, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Israel and Palestinian Affairs, flew in on Friday.\n\nThe US Embassy in Israel said the aim was \u201cto reinforce the need to work toward a sustainable calm.\u201d\n\nIsrael launched day-long attacks on Friday to destroy what it said were several kilometres of tunnels, launch sites and weapons manufacturing warehouses used by the militants in an effort to halt the rocket attacks.\n\nAcross central and southern Israel, from small towns bordering Gaza to metropolitan Tel Aviv and southern Beersheba, people have adjusted to sirens wailing, radio and TV broadcast interruptions and the beeps of cellphones bearing red alerts that send them rushing for cover.\n\nCross-border hostilities between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza have been accompanied by violence in mixed communities of Jews and Arabs in Israel. Synagogues have been attacked and street fights have broken out, prompting Israel\u2019s president to warn of civil war.\n\nEgypt was leading regional efforts to secure a ceasefire. Cairo was pushing for both sides to cease fire from midnight on Friday pending further negotiations, two Egyptian security sources said, with Egypt leaning on Hamas and others, including the United States, trying to reach an agreement with Israel.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan discussed efforts to end the Gaza confrontation and to prevent \u201cprovocations\u201d in Jerusalem, Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry said.\n\n\u201cThe talks have taken a real and serious path on Friday,\u201d a Palestinian official said. \u201cThe mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations are stepping up their contacts with all sides in a bid to restore calm, but a deal hasn\u2019t yet been reached.\u201d\n\nThe United Arab Emirates on Friday called for a ceasefire and negotiations while offering condolences to all victims of the fighting, citing the promise of September accords that made the UAE and Bahrain the first Arab states in a quarter century to establish formal ties with Israel.\n\nHamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, launched the rocket attacks on Monday, in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe Israeli military said more than 2,000 rockets had been fired from Gaza into Israel since the start of the conflict, around half of them intercepted by missile defence systems and 350 fell into the Gaza Strip.\n\nCivil unrest between Jews and Arabs in Israel itself dealt a strong blow to efforts by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s opponents to unseat the Israeli leader after a series of inconclusive elections, giving rise to expectations Israelis will go to the polls for an unprecedented fifth time in just over two years.",

          "title": "Parents Panic after Abductors of 16 Kaduna Varsity Students Cut Contact Eight Days Ago",
          "text": "Parents of the remaining 16 abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna State, have been thrown into further confusion, following the decision of the kidnappers to cut further communications with them.\n\nBandits invaded the school on April 18 and abducted 22 students and a staff. They initially demanded N800 million for the release of the students. However, to push their demand for ransom, they killed five of the students on two occasions, when negotiations were still ongoing.\n\nSources said the last time the kidnappers called any of the parents was on May 8, eight days ago, during which they made fresh demand of N10 million ransom on each of the 16 students and a staff of the university still being held, which comes to N170 million.\n\nPrior to this, the parents had collectively paid N60 million ransom without getting a result.\n\nThe decision of the kidnappers to cut communications for days has been causing great anxiety among the parents, with some of them afraid for the lives of their children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is happening again. We don\u2019t know what is happening to our children. They (kidnappers) are not talking to us again. You know they have been threatening to kill them if we don\u2019t pay more and suddenly we are not hearing anything again. We are so scared and praying that God will touch their hearts not to harm our children. We are anxiously waiting for them (bandits) to call and say something, so that we will know that our children are alive,\u201d remarked one of the parents yesterday.\n\nThe distraught parents are appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari to help secure the release of the students before \u201csomething sinister happens to them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna yesterday during a special prayer session for the release of the students, spokesman of the parents, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, urged Buhari to use his good offices to secure the release of their children.\n\nAccording to him, the kidnappers have demanded N10 million from each of the parents of the students, making a total of N160 million for 16 students.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about their safety. The innocent students had spent 24 days in the kidnappers\u2019 den. Even after, we the parents have collectively paid them over N60 million ransom for the release of our children, they failed to release them.\n\n\u201cWe, the parents are appealing to the federal government to assist us to pay the ransom demanded or find any other way to ensure the safe return of our children,\u201d Zarmai pleaded.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, the leader of the bandits who abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa service, on May 3, threatened to kill them if a ransom of N100 million, in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles, were not provided the following day.\n\nJalingo confirmed that the families of the abducted students had already paid N55 million, adding that money had been spent on feeding the students.\n\nOne of the students was released after his parents paid N20 million ransom to the bandits.\n\nThe Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-rufai has not helped matters by openly declaring that he would not pay ransom to kidnappers. However, he has not been able to motivate the rescue of any of the abductees since his declaration.\n\nSecurity agencies have also been lethargic in their approach to freeing the Greenfield 17. Most Nigerians still cannot comprehend why they cannot track the location of the abductees and rescue them, despite previous numerous communications between the parents and the kidnappers.\n\nThe federal government and the Kaduna State Government and security agencies have come under intense criticism for their failure to secure the adducted Greenfield University students after 28 days in the dungeon of their abductors.\n\nAfter the kidnappers killed the first three students, the leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, remarked that it was regrettable that security situation could break down so bad in a regime led by a retired army general.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt shows the extent to which security has broken down under General Muhammadu Buhari. It shows his incompetence and how far he is inefficient as a former commander. Each time we talk about him, Lai Mohammed will put up a propaganda saying everything is in order and Buhari is the best President that we have ever had. It is until they kill all of us that they will now know he should have left the place. Law and order have broken down in the country, there\u2019s no doubt about that. The earlier people persuade Buhari to get out of the place the better for all of us.\u201d\n\nMike Ozekhome, (SAN) said he wasn\u2019t disappointed at the floppy manner in which the federal government has been handling the issue of kidnappings in Nigeria, especially in the recent time.\n\nThe fiery lawyer said Nigerians ought not to be surprised at the turn of things in the country, given the failure of the government to resolve previous kidnappings. He asked, \u201cWhat were Nigerians expecting? Where is Leah Sharibu? Where are the Chibok girls abducted since April 2014? Has this government ever walked the talk in its vain glorious posturing against Boko Haram, armed banditry, herdsmen, kidnapping and other violent crimes across the board in Nigeria? Has Nigeria not been turned into a sprawling field of crimson and pouring the blood of innocent Nigerians?\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and John Shiklam in Kaduna",
