It was controversial. When I asked him what happened, did you rape the minor, he (Baba Ijesha) said \u2018Yomi, I never did. Princess brought a general to harass me.

          "title": "Save us from land grabbers, Nasarawa community begs Gov Sule",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nResidents of Zhewun-Yelwa, a village located in Karu local government area of Nasarawa State, yesterday, trooped out in their numbers to protest against what they see as an attempt by land grabbers to displace them from their ancestral homes.\n\nLocated about two kilometres away from Mararaba, the centre of commerce in the North Central state; Zhehun-Yelwa boasts of sprawling arable land and lush green vegetation. Populated largely by the Gbagyi ethnic nation, the community also houses Nigerians of other ethnic nationalities including Tiv, Idoma, Yoruba, among others.\n\nGathered in their numbers at the Yelwa Primary School for a peaceful rally, the protesters bearing various placards reading, \u201cOur fathers\u2019 graveyards are not for sale,\u201d \u201cLand grabbers, leave us alone,\u201d \u201cAllow our ancestors to rest in peace,\u201d \u201cWe are going nowhere,\u201d among others; they vowed to resist any attempt to deprive them of the only community they have known as home for years.\n\nFrom the Primary School premises, they marched to the Palace of the Village Head, Chief Bebunwa Haruna, who received them warmly and directed Emmanuel Danjuma, a youth leader, to speak on behalf of Yelwa indigenes.\n\nAmidst thunderous shouts of \u201cWe no go gree,\u201d Danjuma narrated how three men purportedly from the Nasarawa state government came to the community a little over a week ago to inform the inhabitants to prepare to quit the community on the orders of government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are here to protect our ancestral land. On the third of May, some people came here, saying they were sent by the Nasarawa state government to our chief, Mr. Bebunwa Haruna to inform us that the government has taken over our land here in Zhewun-Yelwa. We are gathered here to say no to this. This is our land and it is our heritage. Our forefathers are buried here for centuries past. We have had more than three successive chiefs in this community who have ruled us peacefully.\n\n\u201cWe are predominantly farmers. They told us that our land has been acquired and that they will bring forms for us to fill and attach our passport photographs. But we are saying the land housing the remains of our ancestors cannot be taken over from us. We will remain here as long as we live. We have nowhere else to go. Our land is not for sale.\n\n\u201cWe have been abandoned by the government. They did not tell us what they intend to use the land for. It appears they just want to take it from us with the use of force but we won\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nAlthough Lucky Itodo originally hails from neighboring Benue state, he has lived in Yelwa long enough to see himself as part of the agrarian community.\n\nHe told Saturday Vanguard that the manner the men presented themselves smacked of fraud, wondering why supposed emissary of a state government would be sent to a community for such important information as displacing a whole village, without an official letter.\n\nHis words: I am Idoma by tribe, but I was born and brought up in this community. My father lived here for years until he died. I have been here for the past 41 years. The present chief is 41 years on the throne too.\n\n\u201cThere is a process on how government, being it federal or state, can take over land being inhabited by people. That process has to be legal. The governor will have to delegate officials of his government to speak with the people, particularly the Commissioner of Land and Survey. This is not the case here as we speak.\n\n\u201cYou can see the mammoth crowd and how angry the people are at this attempt by some faceless people to take away from them their treasured heritage.\n\n\u201cThey just told us verbally. They didn\u2019t even present a written notification from the state government. They are threatening us. They said we are not educated. The state governor should listen to our cry and protect us from these people,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nLike Itodo, Mrs. Ujuaku Fairley, an Igbo lady married to a Yoruba man has been living in Yelwa for long.\n\nA graduate of International Relations, Mrs. Fairley is a subsistent farmer, having toiled in vain in search of a job in the city for years. She wants the state government to come to the aid of Yelwa residents as quickly as possible.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe know that government owns all lands but there are rules to follow because you can\u2019t just displace a community like that. We have been here for years. I have been here for 15 years.\n\n\u201cI believe these are land grabbers bent on taking advantage of people they believe have no one to help them. We are appealing to Governor Sule to come to our aid and save us from these people. They are using the governor\u2019s name to perpetrate evil. The governor should stop them.\n\n\u201cThere are no jobs and our youths are farming to make ends meet. Then, suddenly, they want to displace us. Everything you see here is a product of communal effort. We joined hands together to sink a borehole and we bought the transformer here that is powering our homes. We have primary schools and a health centre,\u201d she added.\n\nThe most touching display of emotion at the protest was the lamentation of Saratu Ezekiel, an elderly woman displaced by Boko Haram elements in Gwoza, Borno state in 2011.\n\nSpeaking in Hausa, the dark-skinned woman decried the continuous reign of injustice in various forms, saying, \u201cthey pursued us from our homes in Gwoza and we found another home here. Now, they are asking us to leave? I will wait for them to come here and do their worse. We are not moving an inch from this place,\u201d she said as the protesters applauded every word she uttered.\n\nIt is not clear if indeed the Governor Sule-led government intends to take over Yelwa. If indeed, the land is needed for some industrial or residential purposes by government; the process of informing these poor farmers should have been formal than the approach adopted by the supposed officials of the Nasarawa state government.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026As ALGON backs govs, asks LGs to commence enforcement\n\nBy Festus Ahon & Peter Duru\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State said yesterday that any Nigerian opposed to the resolve of Southern governors to ban open grazing of cattle in that part of the country has a hidden agenda.\n\nThis is even as Delta State chapter of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria, ALGON, threw its weight behind the governors\u2019 action, and asked all the local government areas in the state to commence enforcement of the ban.\n\nThe governor, who spoke during an address on the occasion of \u2018Media Week and Communications Day 2021\u2019, organised by the Catholic Diocese of Makurdi, noted that his colleagues from the South towed the right path to address insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nHe said open grazing was no longer feasible in the country due to development and population growth, hence the need to ban it.\n\n\u201dNigeria is a great country with great potential and should, ordinarily, have no business with poverty if only there is guaranteed security for lives and property and the people are allowed to remain stable in their localities to explore opportunities in farming and other ventures,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Christians and Muslims in Benue State as well as residents and citizens of the state for remaining supportive of his administration.\n\nHe also acknowledged the good reportage of government policies and programmes by the Directorate of Social Communication, Catholic Diocese of Makurdi and all the media groups in Benue, pointing out that his administration would always welcome constructive criticisms.\n\nThe governor, who dropped hint of his administration\u2019s plans to commence teaching of vernacular in schools in the next academic session, said children must be trained and supported to inculcate reading in them, even as he described communication as key in the society.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Catholic Bishop of Makurdi Diocese, Most Reverend Wilfred Anagbe, stated that social communication was meant to uplift humanity and the society, stressing that it was a positive aspect of reality of life and not the other way round.\n\nBishop Anagbe, who canvassed the teaching of history and vernacular in primary and secondary schools in the state, said \u201clanguage defines a man and so should not be allowed to go extinct.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Delta State chapter of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria, ALGON, has backed Southern governors on the ban on open grazing of cattle in the southern part of the country.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the monthly meeting of the Association in Warri South Local Government Council, ALGON Chairman in the state, who is also the chairman of Ika North East Local Government Area, Mr Victor Ebonka, said: \u201cSouthern farmers are losing hundreds of millions of naira to plundering of food crops through encroachments on farmlands and exposing the region to famine and acute food scarcity\u201d.\n\nWhile urging the governors to match their resolution with actions, Ebonka said: \u201cEnough is enough of these criminal herdsmen who have been terrorizing our people.\n\n\u201cWe are tired and sick of the activities of these killer herdsmen. Our farmers now find it difficult to go to farm for fear of being raped, killed or kidnapped. Our rural dwellers can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of being attacked by these rampaging armed herdsmen.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, resolved in our meeting to enforce the ban on open grazing in our various local government areas. We have asked our council chairmen to liaise with relevant authorities and ensure the immediate enforcement of the ban.\n\n\u201cOpen grazing is no longer acceptable to us as a people. Those who trade in cows should device a better and modern method of keeping their cattle. We shall no longer tolerate open grazing in our communities.\n\n\u201cWe also back our governors on the call for a national dialogue, restructuring, respect for federal character among other resolutions reached by our governors.\u201d\n\nRecall that the Southern governors had at a meeting in Asaba, Delta State capital, on Tuesday, banned open grazing in the region as part of effort to address herders-farmers clashes and senseless kidnapping as well as killings of Nigerian citizens of southern extraction.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan has cautioned States\u2019 Governors and other elected leaders against joining the agitations for secession or calling for restructuring of the country.\n\nLawan, who stated this while fielding questions from State House correspondents in Abuja on Thursday, said he was not against those calling for restructuring but elected officials must not be among those advocating for such calls.\n\nAccording to him, state governors must ensure that they restructure their respective states first before calling for restructuring at the federal level.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe call for secession or the call for restructuring, many are genuine calls even though I never believe that someone who is calling for secession means well or is a misguided person.\n\n\u201cBut I believe that when somebody calls for improving the structure that we have is a genuine call.\n\n\u201cBut I want to advice here, I believe that as leaders those of us who were elected must not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing because even if you are a governor you are supposed to be working hard in your state to ensure that this restructuring you are calling for at the federal level you have done it in your state as well.\n\n\u201cThis is because what you may accuse the federal government of whatever it is, you may also be accused of the same thing in your state.\n\n\u201cSo, we are supposed to ensure that we have a complete and total way of ensuring that our systems at the federal, state and even local government work for the people, and that we allow people to participate in governance so that whoever feels that he has something to offer to make Nigeria better does so freely without any hindrance.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe senate president said Nigerians must come together regardless of their religious, ethnic or political persuasions to find lasting solutions to the nation challenges.\n\nHe, therefore, called on all elected leaders across the three tiers of government to always avoid primordial sentiments capable of creating division and social discontent among Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe should avoid partisanship, we should avoid regionalism. We are all leaders and we are in this together. The solution must come from us regardless of what level of government we are \u2013 whether at the federal, state or even at the local government level,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nLawan also frowned at the way and manner local government system was relegated to the background in the country, saying for the nation to address its security challenges the local government system must be functional and efficient.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity also to say that we have diminished the local government system. I think we can attribute some of the security issues to the lack of functional local government system.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the time has come for us to take up the challenge to ensure that the local government system functions. This is in keeping with looking for ways, for means, for solutions to the security challenges that we face. We must never neglect the local government system.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is one system that had worked even though in a different name. When it was Native Authority it was very effective, very efficient.\n\n\u201cSo, we must go back to our local government to ensure that the local government continues to be autonomous, continues to be functional in order to compliment whatever the States and the Federal Government would be doing.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who also spoke to the correspondents, called for a national spirit of oneness, saying that \u201cIf truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame for what\u2019s happening today.\n\n\u201cWhatever challenges we have, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve these issues we\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cWe must imbibe that spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity and love that would take us through this.\u201d\n\nHe enjoined Nigerians to always be their brothers\u2019 keepers and avoid acts capable of creating social unrest.",

          "text": "Samuel Chukwueze has been listed by UEFA as a player to watch , describing the Nigerian youngster as a \u201cprecocious winger with UEFA Europa League experience. The Super Eagles winger who will be 22 on May 22 is looking forward to lift the Europa League trophy with Villarreal when the La Liga side battle Manchester United in the final on Wednesday, May 26 at the Stadion Energa Gda\u0144sk in Poland. In a virtual interaction orchestrated by LiveScore.com through their partnership with La Liga Santander, Chukwueze spoke on several issues relating to his career.\n\nSamuel Chukwueze grew through the rank at Villarreal to become an integral member of coach Unai Emery team that worked their way into the final of the Europa League.\n\nDespite doubt over his involvement in the final for Villarreal, Chukwueze cannot wait to cuddle the trophy being his first title with the Submarine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like you to tell me that I am going to win the UEFA Europa League, just tell me that! I want to win the UEFA Europa League,\u201d enthused Chukwueze.\n\nRecalling his childhood experience, he said: \u201cFor me it was about street football, street tournaments when I was growing up. I can remember when I was eight years old, I used to play with the older kids who would choose me for their team. When I used to dribble past two or three people, they used to knock me on the head, so those are the memories I have from when I was growing up.\u201d\n\nFor him, the thought of professional football was birthed when he was 14. \u201cI think that was when I was 14 years old, when I went to the Iber Cup that the thought of professional football was ignited. I won the highest goal scorer at the tournament, playing against young players from European teams Sevilla FC and RCD Espanyol, that was when I realised, I can take this football thing seriously.\u201d\n\nAn admirer of Okocha and Kanu Nwankwo, Chukwueze has an honourable list of European admirers too: \u201cWhen I was young in Nigeria, I remember I loved watching Jay-Jay Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu. Every kid in Nigeria was watching them and these two were two of my idols growing up.\n\nI\u2019m going to choose Zinedine Zidane for the football brain, Cristiano Ronaldo for strength and Lionel Messi for the feet,\u201d Chukwueze said.\n\nThe former NFF Youth Player of the Year described his call-up to the Super Eagles as a proud moment of his life.\n\n\u201cThe day I heard from somebody, \u2018you are invited to the national team of Nigeria\u2019, I didn\u2019t believe it the first time. I called my mum and told her \u2018Mum, I\u2019ve been invited to the national team\u2019, and she was so proud. I called my brother, and he was so happy too. It was a great moment, it was a dream come true for me. I had only just broken into the first team at Villarreal CF and they invited me, I couldn\u2019t believe it. It was just amazing,\u201d he admitted.\n\nAn indigene of Umuahia, the capital city of Abia State in South Eastern part of Nigeria has been a blessing.\n\n\u201cAll of my heart is in Umuahia; I think that Umuahia is in the Bible. This state is in the Bible because God blessed this place, he blessed Umuahia, that is why it is amazing and great people come from that place.\u201d\n\nSince 2018, when he made his senior debut for Villarreal, Chukwueze said his game continues to improve with each game.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think my game has changed so much, coming from Nigeria to come and play in Europe at Villarreal CF. Before I saw football as entertainment just to play how I want, attack and dribble to entertain the fans.\n\n\u201cNow I think I understand what it means to be tactically disciplined, knowing when to attack, when to defend. I think my overall understanding of the game has changed a huge amount.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most talented player I have played with during your time at Villarreal has to be Santi Cazorla, he is a fantastic player who can play so well with both feet; he is special and very talented.\n\nFor him, C\u00e1diz CF and Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid are the two teams that have surprised him this season in La Liga.\n\n\u201cC\u00e1diz CF and Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid are two teams I have been surprised by this year. C\u00e1diz CF in particular, they have some really good players. They won at the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano against Real Madrid C.F. and they also won against FC Barcelona, two teams that it is great to win against. I think they are actually very good both tactically and also how they play.\n\nWith several talents in La Liga, but Chukwueze has a huge respect for other youngsters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere are so many good players in La Liga,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou have Bryan Gil, Ansu Fati, and Yeremi Pino at Villarreal.\n\n\u201cFor me I would choose Yeremi \u2013 he\u2019s a fantastic player. He\u2019s a young lad, he has the speed and the talent, and importantly he is working very hard.\u201d\n\nHowever, he picked teammate Gerard Moreno as the most impressive player this season in La Liga\u201d \u201cFor me I am going to say my teammate Gerard Moreno. He has been amazing since LaLiga re-started. He has scored so many goals and always plays very well.\u201d\n\nFor upcoming players, he counselled: \u201cThe only advice I should give young players is work and be disciplined, both on the field and off it. That is the most important thing, to focus on where they are heading. They should forget about wanting to get money and instead focus on wanting to work hard. If they do this, everything else will follow.\u201d",

          "text": "By Bassey Anthony, Uyo\n\nAn independent investigative journalist, David Hundeyin, has warned Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, not to threaten him with a lawsuit over his findings and publication on the killing of Miss Iniubong Umoren.\n\nHundeyin had made series of tweets and other online publications suggesting Akpabio and his wife played a part in the rape and eventual death of the 26-year- old Iniuobong Umoren.\n\nHundeyin further said Davok hotel located at 58, G Unit also recognised as plot S9,Unit G, Ewet Housing, Estate, Uyo which was used by the suspect(s) for their nefarious activities is owned by Akpabio\u2019s wife.\n\nAkpabio in his reaction through his lawyer, Otobong Inyang Esq, wrote to Hundeyin, demanding retraction of a news publication and an apology within 14 days failing which he would take legal action.\n\nRather than apologise, Hundeyin has asked for authorisation to Airtel and MTN to release the voice note of the conversation between the alleged suspects instead of threatening him with lawsuits, saying such will end up the matter.\n\nIn his handle @DavidHundeyin, he tweeted: \u201cInstead of sending old policemen to fight with me on TV or threatening me with lawsuits, just authorise Airtel and MTN to release the voice note of the conversation between Frank Akpan and Kufre Effiong. Very simple and will end this controversy. No need for plenty talk.\u201d\n\nAkpabio, a former Senate Minority leader, made the demands in a letter he addressed to the author of the articles via BusinessDay Media organisation.\n\nThe letter signed by the Minister\u2019s lawyer, Otobong Inyang Esq, dated Wednesday 12 May, 2021, was in response to series of tweets and other online publications by the author linking him (Akpabio) and his wife, Unoma Akpabio to have played a part in the rape and eventual death of Umoren.\n\nIn the letter Akpabio claimed the author had made statements suggesting the hotel located at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate, is also recognised as plot S9,Unit G, Ewet Housing, Estate, Uyo, which the suspect(s) used for their activities, is owned by his wife, which was not true.\n\nAccording to Akpabio, the author\u2019s publications give impression he and his wife were not only complicit in the death of Umoren but were also members of a syndicate specialising in the procurement, sale and/or use of human body parts for ritual among others.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201d Reporter, Columnist and Writer and in the said capacity, you issued a purported investigative report regarding the alleged abduction, rape and murder of one Iniobong Umoren, the late University of Uyo graduate.\n\n\u201cIn the said Report which you published on Your Twitter handle @DavidHundeyin, Facebook Page/Timeline and on several online news channels/platforms such as NewsWireNGR of 1l/5/2021, e.t.c., you alleged that a certain Kufre Effiong was complicit in the alleged murder and also attempted to portray our clients as being members of an alleged syndicate responsible for perpetuating the dastardly act.\n\n\u201cIn a paragraph in your said report, you made the statement thus: \u201cWho exactly is Kufre Effiong? I eventually found the answer after scrolling through dozens, maybe hundreds of social media profiles with that name. Mr. Effiong as it turns out, is something of a big fish in Niger Delta civil service circles.\n\n\u201cAfter having alleged that subsequent to the abduction, rape and murder of the deceased, Uduak Akpan met with Kufre Effiong, you went on to state in another paragraph of your report thus:\n\n\u201cThe second possibility is more prosaic, but no less horrific. Due to the convoluted house numbering system in Uyo, the property labeled as 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is also recognized on most digital maps as Plot S9, Unit G, Ewet Housing Estate.\n\n\u201cThat address is also home to Davok Suites, which is a popular upmarket hotel in Uyo favoured by high profile guests including the Cameroon national team. This would be the ideal location for a trusted associate of a politician \u2013 say, a senior civil servant \u2013 to lay his head while running a clandestine errand for his boss.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAn errand such as sourcing human parts for use in a ritual sacrifice ahead of the upcoming election season, for example.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is that happened or is happening at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate \u2013 and for whose benefit \u2013 is a question only Kufre Effiong can answer\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIn one of your Tweets via Twitter handle @DavidHundeyin of 11th May\u2019 2021, you published the following statement to the entire world:\n\n\u201cIt has just come to my attention that Davok Suites, the hotel at the centre of the 58 Unit G/S. 9, Unit G, Ewet Housing Estate nexus involving Kufre Effiong and Frank uduak is owned by none other than Ekaette Akpabio, wife of Godswill Akpabio.\u201d\n\nThe Minister demanded the retractions and public apology be published in NewswireNGR, the author\u2019s Twitter Handle, Facebook Page/Timeline and all other online news/media platforms and channels he used to publish the publications.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, blamed the delay in supply of military hardware by manufactures for the handicap the administration is facing in fighting Boko Haram, bandits and other violent crimes in the country.\n\nHe stated this shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast at Aso Villa, Abuja, yesterday, while calling for understanding by Nigerians.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said: \u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order for weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers to ship them, and when brought here, eventually, they are taken to training institutions, where we train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process. I expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at time and available resources.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we came in, in the North East, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest, and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nHe, however, vowed to use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits, to ensure that they do not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming farming season.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement coming after nearly six years in power is, however, seen by many as contradicting his 2015 election promise of ridding the country of all forms of terrorism and insurgency within the shortest possible time. Under his reign, violent crimes have been on the increase, spreading from the North East to North West and, lately, South east and South South where Fulani herdsmen and bandits have invaded communities, farmlands and schools, killing and kidnapping hundreds for ransom.\n\nThe president, while expressing the hope for a good rainy season this year, said \u201cthe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land, so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today, both on security and the economy, and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for its support, saying emphatically that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has thanked God for enabling them witness the end of Ramadan.\n\nShe appealed to Nigerian women to take responsibility of their children by guarding and protecting them against abuse and other vices.\n\n\u2022Young farmers urge emergency plan to forestall food crisis\n\nThe Nigeria Young Farmers Network has said an emergency national food security plan, that would actively engage the private sector, is critical to forestall the nation\u2019s imminent food crisis.\n\nThe Director General (DG) of the network, Mr Promise Amahah, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAmahah spoke against the backdrop of the relentless increase in prices of food and agricultural produce in Nigerian markets, which he warned might lead to a national food crisis very soon.\n\nHe said that government alone could not achieve reasonable progress in this regard, adding that more intensive action was required to address the challenge.\n\nAmahah said the Federal Government needed to provide the enabling environment for companies and startups providing solutions like storage facilities, logistics, payments, among others.\n\n\u2022Onyewuchi harps on justice, fairness\n\nThe Senator representing Imo East Senatorial District, Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi, has commended the Southern Governors Forum for what he described as their principled and patriotic position on various issues bedeviling Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Chiaka Alozie, the senator insisted that in line with the position of the governors, only justice and fairness can guarantee the unity and progress of the country.\n\nOnyewuchi bemoaned the hardship faced by millions of Nigerians, adding that there is an urgent need to address the rising insecurity, economic downturn and increasing agitations by different ethnic nationalities, for the restructuring of the country.\n\nHe said that Nigerians yearn for a country that works for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic and religious backgrounds, while taking into consideration the sensitivity of the diversity of the country.\n\nHe urged the southern governors to continue to work with other stakeholders to ensure that the dream for a better Nigeria is realised.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nPresident Muhammadu\u2248 Buhari, yesterday, joined other Nigerians to mourn former Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Lt.

At certain level, people will be talking, but we only know the beginning of a war, not the end. Nobody will remember how the war in Syria started and it is still on for years. And everything they built is being destroyed. So, I think we have to do it softly. We have started democracy. We are not happy with the way it is going.\n\n\u201cBut even Quran says there will be time when God will give you good leaders; there will be time when the leaders that you are given by God are not as good because He wants you people to see the difference. We should assume that this too will pass. It started six years ago. In another two years, it will go.\n\n\u201cIf you are saying because of that you want to go or you don\u2019t want to go, who even tells you that the North is not even getting ready to go? Let us look at it, people in the South are talking too much, and people up North are acting too much.\n\n\u201cIn Yorubaland, we talk too much. The North is also preparing to leave and they are working at it. Do you think it is a mistake that they are constructing railway to Niger Republic when we have not built railway from Ibadan to Kano, not even Abuja, and they said it is the first place we are going to spend our money?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the refinery in Kaduna be repaired? Why are they saying they would build another refinery in Daura (Katsina State)? And they would be bringing crude oil from Niger Republic to the place. Don\u2019t let us deceive ourselves, maybe a time will come when all of us will sit down together and separate peacefully.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022President pleads for more understanding, says time needed to take delivery of weapons\n\n\u2022Vows to resist bandits\u2019 threat to food security\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari and state governors to address the security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nThe Sultan spoke yesterday as the president pleaded for more elite understanding on raging strife in the country, explaining that time is needed for equipment procured, to fight agents of violence to submission, to be delivered.\n\nAbubakar in his Sallah message in Sokoto yesterday said the security challenges had continued to remain a great concern to all.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on President Muhammadu Buhari and all the state governors to, as a matter of urgency, bring to an end the insecurity across the country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAs our leaders, you should continue to remain resolute and more committed to your various responsibilities of protecting the society.\u201d\n\nThe monarch cum spiritual leader said the president and the governors should enhance their commitment toward the restoration of the peaceful nature that the country was long known for.\n\nHe called on Muslims to pray more for their leaders to cope with their responsibilities.\n\nHe urged Muslims to continue to sustain the spirit of charity, generosity, hospitality and brotherhood that Eid-el-Fitr symbolises.\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for all of us to celebrate, show love, support and relate with one another, as such we should sustain the commitment for our best desire,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sultan urged the residents of Sokoto State to strictly adhere to the COVID-19 protocols and guidelines throughout the Sallah celebration.\n\nPresident Pleads for More Understanding\n\nBuhari, however, called for more understanding by Nigerians, especially the elite, as his administration battles to end the siege on the nation by non-state actors behind banditry, insurgency and kidnapping.\n\nHe stated that the elite should understand the military operation as it takes time for equipment procured to tackle insecurity to arrive in the country.\n\nHe expressed the readiness of his administration to resist the threat by bandits to disrupt national food production in the coming growing season.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen yesterday after observing the Eid prayer to end the Ramadan fast at the State House, Abuja, the president pledged that his administration will use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits to ensure that they did not create havoc against access to farms and food production.\n\nHe assured Nigerians that the menace of bandits and kidnappers will be addressed to ensure that the nation\u2019s food security is not threatened.\n\nThe president, who hoped for a good rainy season this year, said: \u201cThe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nCommenting on ongoing efforts by his administration to tackle the security crisis, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying part of the resolutions reached at the meetings had been made public by the National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), and the others kept secret.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nHe commended the National Assembly for its support, saying: \u201cThe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nBuhari appealed to the elite to show a better appreciation of the problems facing the country.\n\n\u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers (to produce them). It takes time to ship them and when brought here eventually, they are taken to training institutions, train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process,\u201d the president stated.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians for more understanding of the current situation in the country.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources.\n\nFor example, when we came in, in the North-east, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States, and the South-south, in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment are what is happening in the North-west and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nBuhari and members of his family were joined for the Eid at the forecourt of the Presidential Villa by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; the Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, cabinet members and the heads of security and intelligence agencies.\n\nBuhari, Aisha Step out Together First Time in Months\n\nFor the first time in months, Buhari yesterday stepped out with his wife, Aisha, to celebrate this year\u2019s Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nBuhari shared many photos on social media where he and his wife were surrounded by their children and their spouses.\n\nIn some of the photos, Buhari was also seen with his grandchildren.\n\nIn a string of tweets, the president congratulated all Muslims on the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid festival and prayed that it will bring with it peace, safety, security, brotherhood and love amongst others.\n\nHe sought \u201cunity and solidarity among all citizens, Muslims and Christians,\u201d adding that these virtues are imperative \u201cespecially at a time when our country is faced with multiple challenges which are surmountable only when we come together as one.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Cartel records lowest quota compliance in 12 months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry growth declined by 19.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to data from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOPEC, in a country-by-country analysis of developments within its member countries in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), said the previous month, it fell by 13.9 per cent, although the non-oil sector grew by 1.7 per cent.\n\nThe report showed that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.1 per cent year-on-year in Q4, 2020, following a 3.6 per cent contraction in Q3, 2020, which was the first positive quarterly growth in the last three quarters amid the gradual return of economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil sector expanded 1.7 per cent, recovering from a 2.5 per cent decline in 3Q,2020, mainly driven by growth in the telecommunications and information services sectors.\n\n\u201cOther important contributions came from the agricultural sector, which expanded by 3.4 per cent y-o-y in 4Q, 2020. Meanwhile, the oil sector dropped by 19.8 per cent y-o-y after a 13.9 per cent y-o-y contraction in 3Q, 2020,\u201d the report for May stated.\n\nIt stated that in 2020, the economy contracted 1.9 per cent y-o-y, following a 2.3 per cent y-o-y expansion in 2019, while inflation was still structurally high in the first quarter of this year, with the annual inflation rate jumping to 18.17 per cent in March 2021, the highest rate since January 2017 amid the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has also weakened the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, a surge in oil output by Russia and Oman in April lowered the compliance rate to the OPEC+ production cuts, with the nine non-OPEC countries that participate in the cuts overproducing by 347,000 barrels per day, equating to a compliance rate of 85 per cent, the lowest level for the 12 months that the pact had been in force.\n\nCompliance among the 10 participating OPEC countries, by contrast, was 123 per cent, thanks largely to the Saudis\u2019 additional voluntary reduction of one million bpd in February-April, which came on top of its official OPEC+ cut of 1.88 million bpd.\n\nThe average compliance rate for the entire OPEC+ group fell to 110 per cent in April from a record high of 113 per cent in March.\n\nThe non-OPEC partners\u2019 poor performance is certain to aggravate the Saudis and other Mideast and African producers, which have hit their targets in recent months which could create a tense atmosphere during future negotiations about opening the taps in the second half of the year.\n\nSaudi Arabia is looking to unwind its voluntary cut of one million bpd in May-July, which will necessitate winning back market share that it ceded in Asia when the voluntary cut was enacted in February.\n\nAlso, oil prices dropped by almost three per cent yesterday and were set for the biggest percentage drop since early April, after the restart of Colonial Pipeline, eased some of the concerns about petrol shortages in the U.S. East.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, West Texas International crude was falling by 2.94 per cent at $64.14 while Brent Crude was down by 2.64 per cent at $67.49.\n\nOil prices snapped the winning streak from earlier this week when reports from both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reiterated the view that global oil demand would rebound strongly in the second half of the year with more economies reopening and increased travel amid higher vaccination rates.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s bullish outlook on demand, coupled with a similar view from OPEC from Tuesday, sent oil prices to an eight-week high on Wednesday, almost hitting $70.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Daramola Joseph, CAN prayed that the aftermath of this year\u2019s Ramadan would usher in peace and unity into the country.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe are not unaware that your fasting was in obedience to the divine directive: \u2018O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous\u2019 \u2014 Surat Al-Baqarah 2:183.\n\n\u201cMay God answer all your godly prayers offered throughout the month.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the leadership of NSCIA to continue to advise and caution the extremists who are not well-grounded in the faith and whose wicked and ungodly actions are giving bad names to Islam.\n\n\u201cIt is trite to know that no godly person will engage in the promotion of violence, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism or identify with the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nCAN said it recognised and appreciated the \u2018efforts\u2019 being made by the police and other security agencies towards ensuring peaceful celebrations.\n\nIt said it would not relent in promoting religious tolerance, peace and unity in collaboration with NSCIA.\n\nAccording to it, \u201cWe remain partners in peace-making.

          "title": "Boko Haram Scare: Law School DG Insensitive, Says NBA Chairman",
          "text": "Eromosele Abiodun and Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikeja Branch, Mr. Bath Aguegbodo, has accused the Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Professor Isa Ciroma (SAN), of being insensitive to the danger students billed to write their examination next week at the Bwari campus of the school would be exposed to due to the scare of bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\nHe said the students should be allowed to write the examinations scheduled to start from Monday at other campuses due to the reported security scare in the Bwari area.\n\nAguegbodo stated this yesterday when he appeared on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a breakfast programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think it would be out of insensitivity on the part of the director-general to continue to insist that the exams would be taken. If you look at the Chibok issue, there was intelligence information to both the security agencies and the management of the school that they were open to attack and they ignored it. I think it is important for everybody to apply pressure on the DG to see reasons.\u201d\n\nThe examination, he stated, must not take place in the Bwari, adding that there are other campuses where security concerns are not as serious as they are in Bwari.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit sad looking at things the way it is panning out; the security of students writing exams in Bwari should be paramount. I have listened to comments credited to the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, and the guarantees are given that security will be provided for students who will write the exams in Bwari.\n\n\u201cBut the question on my mind in the issue is security from where? Just last week, we heard there were attempts in the Villa. The Niger State governor had also said on two occasions that there were some communities in Niger State, which is less than two hours from where the law school is located, that has been taken over by the Boko Haram people,\u201d he said.\n\nAguegbodo added that the argument that JAMB is located at Bwari and some other universities that are located there have not shut down does not hold water.\n\nAccording to him, the psychological state of the students writing the exams must be considered.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat would be the mind of students writing exams when they have fears that they may be kidnapped?\n\n\u201cThe essence of the exams is to assess students as to their preparedness on what they have been taught. I do not see how a fair assessment would be done when a student is writing exams knowing fully well that the bandits are just about two hours away from them.\n\n\u201cThe unsettled mind would definitely reflect in the final result, which would not bring a fair assessment of what the exams are meant to achieve at the end of the day. If they could take their lecture in their various campuses, it would be the necessary thing for the government to look at it, that it is the safety of citizens first before the exams.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Council of Legal Education, attorney-general and the director-general of Nigerian Law school is that the safety of the students must be put into place if the examination is to be a fair assessment of what they have learned.\u201c\n\nHe also canvassed the postponement of the examination by one or two weeks.\n\nSpeaking on who should bear the cost, if the students were to be relocated to other campuses, he said it was the duty of the government to provide a conducive environment for the examinations to hold, adding that if the environment is not conducive, the government would have to bear the cost.\n\nParents of students at the Bwari campus had called on the management of the school to relocate the students to its other campuses owing to reported security scare in the area.\n\nThe worried parents, who insisted that the safety of their wards should be the priority, stated that they did not want to go through the same harrowing experience of parents of the Greenfield University students abducted by bandits in Kaduna recently.\n\nBoko Haram scare has created panic among the residents of the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in recent weeks.\n\nBwari town, an outskirt of Abuja shares a boundary with Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INVESTIGATION: How Rivers State Revenue Officers Divert Millions Of Government Funds Into Private Bank Accounts",
          "text": "In this three-month investigation, this reporter used a pseudonym name, Rose John, poses as a Diploma Student in Ken Polytechnic and paid a total sum of N195,000 to get a tax clearance certificate from two separate staff of Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue offices in Port Harcourt. However, out of the N195,000 paid, only N30,300 went into the coffers of the Rivers State Government. TCC office at the headquarters also collaborates with branch tax officers to cheat the Rivers Government. The reporter had disguised herself to look like the ignorant Nigerian which the tax officers took advantage of.\n\nThe Rivers State Government has several times warned tax officers to stop collecting cash from taxpayers. Rather, they should direct any payment to the Government designated bank, but the tax officers are illegally charging residents and then failing to remit to the government. This, they do in connivance with some bank officials.\n\nBetween August and September 2020, the Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike borrowed over N24billion to accelerate development which included construction of flyover, dualisation of road and compensation to families of demolished buildings among others. Nyesom said the fund will be repaid from the Internally Generated Revenue. What this means is that, with the constant IGR being diverted into an individual account, the Governor might not pay the loan on time. And this will affect development in the state.\n\nInside the Rivers State Secretariat, close to the Podium Block, there is a branch office of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office. Immediately the reporter got close to the entrance of the tax office, she was accosted by a dark female security lady, in blue and black trousers.\n\nThe security officer requested to know the office the reporter was heading to, and when the reporter told her she wanted to get a Tax Clearance Certificate, she was directed to a then pregnant lady called IB, chocolate in complexion.\n\nThe Discussion with IB\n\nThe reporter told IB that she wants to get a tax clearance for herself and her sister who is also a student, and it is part of a requirement to apply for a scholarship abroad. IB told her each TCC will cost N150,000 each, even when the reporter pleads that they want to use it to apply for a scholarship and they are yet to know their fate whether they will be chosen or not.\n\nThe reporter had earlier visited the state revenue branch at Aggrey Road, a fair in complexion officer told her Tax Clearance Certificate for students is free, and all she needed is to submit the school admission letter and payment of school fees receipt.\n\nBut, this is different from what the tax officer(IB) inside the state secretariat told the reporter.\n\n\u201cI will bring the price down to N100,000 each since it's for both\u201d, IB said. The reporter pleaded for the money to be reduced yet it wasn't. IB told the reporter that the amount mentioned, she will still go and discuss with her boss and plead with him to accept the amount.\n\nAfter much argument, the reporter requested IB to give her the state government's bank account number to make payment. IB bluntly told the reporter that she can't pay to the bank because they don't know her, rather she(IB) is the one the reporter needs to pay to the bank. This is contrary to what the Rivers State Government jingles says. The state government has severally said it has no agent representing the government in collection of taxes. The government has warned tax officers not to collect cash rather they should direct the payer to the bank.\n\nIB wanted cash but the reporter intentionally requested her bank account details.Happily, IB, gave the reporter her personal Guaranty Trust bank account details; Diri Ibieri Tonye. IB for short, came from Ibieri, our report understands. The reporter made a transaction of N80,000 on September 17,2020, and to also document cash received, this reporter called IB and informed her that she couldn't make the transfer again if she could bring cash immediately. Same day, the balance of N20,000.00 was given to Ibieri. This was also captured on camera.\n\nTax clearance certificate collected from IB without TIN.\n\nEvery taxpayer is expected to use their Rivers Tax Identification Number to pay their taxes. The reporter was hoping IB would request for RIVTIN but she didn't. Neither did she ask for a document to prove that the reporter\u2019s sister was a student.\n\nAlthough the reporter went with a computerised and edited scanned document as an Admission letter and an edited passport picked from the internet, IB failed to confirm if really the reporter is fake with intention to cheat the government. This act has been perpetrated by several scammers who cheat the government and most times in connivance with the staff of the Rivers Internal Revenue Board\n\nSurprisingly, two days after, IB called this reporter to come pick her tax-clearance certificate that it was ready. Ibieri persuaded the reporter to come to do the second TCC since the previous was ready. The reporter had told IB that once the TCC was ready, she would come to the second TCC for herself.\n\nThe reporter visited IB and she gave the reporter the Tax Clearance Certificate of 3years, starting from 2017, a hundred thousand Naira (N100,000) receipts from Internal Revenue Revenue, and also an stamped Access bank teller to prove to the reporter that she paid the money to the government designated bank as said earlier.\n\nTracking the Stamped Access Bank Teller\n\nThe location of the bank teller states Bank Road. Bank road is close to the state secretariat opposite the Rivers State Judiciary complex.\n\nThe reporter went into the bank to find out the authenticity of the bank teller. The first customer care she met was close to the entrance of the bank, a fair complexioned lady told the reporter, the bank teller is authentic.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see our stamp on it? said the Access bank customer care personnel, without confirming the authenticity of the receipt from the computer.\n\nBut the reporter insisted that she check the system before assuming the bank teller is authentic. The bank official reluctantly told the reporter to move to the extreme of the counter to meet the cashier for confirmation. And this reporter did.\n\n\u201cWhere did you pay this money? The receipt can't be found, said the bank cashier whom the reporter had handed over the bank teller given by the revenue officer, Ibieri. The reporter told her the revenue officer gave her the teller that the money was paid in this branch.\n\nThe reporter insisted the bank cashier should check using the name on the teller, the number and the stamp yet the bank cashier insisted that all had been done yet she could not see any of the names used in payment and the teller number was not recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, Diri Ibieri Tonye used Rose John as given by the reporter to pay the money. What this means is that the N100,000 the reporter paid for Tax Clearance was not paid to the government's bank account; rather, it was paid to the Tax officer of Rivers State Internal revenue board.\n\nThe bank teller and computer printout given to the reporter by IB were also fake, and this can be possible with the help of a bank official.\n\nOn a separate day, the reporter visited the Rumuogba board of Internal Revenue close to Mini-okoro police station. Immediately she entered the reception by the right is an office occupied by two tax officers, a man and a fair woman.\n\nThe reporter moved to the first person, a dark man and told him she wanted to get a tax clearance and he pointed to the other lady, fair in complexion, who identified herself as Legbosi.\n\nLegbosi was attending to a customer, immediately the reporter met her and told her she wanted TCC for herself and her sister, and they are students. This reporter made her aware of the urgency of the TCC to enable her to apply for a scholarship abroad. Immediately, Legbosi brought out a pen, wrote down her telephone contact and told the reporter to go home and call her at 4pm. Earlier, Legbosi had told the reporter to get the school admission letter, ID card and receipt. The reporter, knowing she can't easily get the school ID card, she quickly told Legbosi that she is yet to be given an ID card from the school since 2018.\n\nThis reporter was disguised and looked unkempt when she visited Legbosi's office and pretended to be among the ignorant Nigerians. So, Legbosi, a senior tax officer, decided to take advantage of her looks to cheat her.\n\nIn the evening, this reporter called Legbosi who told her to pay N150,000 after much pleading, the reporter stood her ground on N95,000 and the tax officer, Legbosi agreed. It took over two months before Legbosi agreed for N95,000. This was when the reporter suddenly visited the tax office and told her what they agreed on the phone was N95,000. Legbosi could not remember how much she had told the reporter.\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the reporter visited the tax office, hoping that the state government account would be given to make payment. Legbosi requested cash. The reporter told her to give the state account to make payment but Legbosi said the money was to be paid to her while she would pay to the bank. Just like her colleague Ibiere at the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office inside the state secretariat.\n\nThe reporter requested her bank account and she refused and told the reporter to go across the office and do a withdrawal. Outside the office is the police microfinance bank. The reporter went outside and withdrew the N90,000 and intentionally left N5,000 to be transferred into Legbosi bank to have proof.\n\nTCC collected from Legbosi with TIN\n\nImmediately, the reporter brought out the cash to give Legbosi, she brought out an envelope and requested the cash to be put inside. Our reporter put the cash inside and handed over the money to Legbosi, and told her the ATM failed to transfer the remaining N5,000 if she can share her account details for the balance to be paid. And she did it on a sheet and this reporter transferred the N5,000 balance.\n\nThe Rivers Board of Internal Revenue has also announced that acquiring a Tax Identification number is free, and it is also stated on her facebook page. Legbos asked the reporter to pay two Thousand to get RIVTIN before payment of the Tax payment to get a TCC.\n\nUnfortunately for Legbosi, the reporter had visited the Head office of the State revenue Board as regards TIN and it was done free. The reporter told Legbosi that her sister has a TIN. Legbosi shockingly looked at the reporter but she still couldn't understand the naive lady in front of her. The reporter gave her the TIN\n\nUnfortunately, the reporter didn't notice the money was short of N10,000 and Legbosi called the reporter and informed her. The reporter checked the bag where she brought out the money and saw the extra N10,000. The reporter again requested the tax officer to text her bank details to transfer extra N10,000.\n\nLegbosi sent a text of her Savings First bank account details; Legbosi Ikpabie. This reporter paid and she confirmed seeing the money via text message.\n\nUnlike IB who did not ask for a document to prove that the reporter's relative was a student; Legbosi asked. And the reporter gave her a fake Admission letter, school fees receipt all picked from the internet and edited, and a fake home address.\n\nGetting TCC at Rumuogba\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Legbosi texted the reporter that the TCC is ready. Days after, the reporter visited Legbosi at the tax office and collected the TCC. Only N30,300 was reflected on the receipt given.\n\nEarlier, Legbosi called and told the reporter that out of the N95,000 paid, N50,000 had no receipt, claiming the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office does not give receipt for penalty. She claimed the N50,000 was for penalty for failure to pay tax. Meanwhile, Legbosi never told the reporter that N50,000 would be used for the penalty. She lied again. All monies paid for any purpose in the state had a receipt especially when it was said to be paid into the bank.\n\nThe bank teller brought by Legbosi only reflected N30,300 not the N95,000 as claimed earlier.\n\nThe reporter through her TIN checked the amount paid by Legbosi online, only N30,300 was reflected, and the N50,000 penalty was never stated\n\nRIVERS STATE BOARD OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RSB\n\nRIRS Head Office\n\nRSBIR on her facebook page said it is committed to being the credible Tax Administrator and helping the good people of Rivers State understand and become responsible TAX PAYERS.\n\nThe State Government has made several efforts to ensure residents and businesses owners pay their taxes into the right bank. However, this is done through jingles in various media outlets but there are some ignorant people who would still go to the board office and seek direction to confirm the amount needed to be paid. Rather than the Revenue officers to give direction on the right payment, some officers like Legbosi and IB will still deceive and illegally charge residents yet fail to remit to the government.\n\nThe official website of the RIvers State Board rolled out banks where taxpayers can make payment. The reporter visited the headquarters of the State Revenue board at Trans-Amai to speak with the Executive Chairman, Adoage Norteh to inform her findings. The secretary to the Chairman, an advanced woman denied the report access.\n\nWhen the reporter visited State Revenue headquarters on Friday 27, October, 2020, about 1pm, some security officers told the reporter that the Chairman was in his office. The reporter introduced herself and told the secretary that she has information for the chairman. And the secretary asked the reporter if she was on appointment, the reporter said, No, and the Chairman\u2019s secretary replied, \u201cThen, you can\u2019t see him\u201d. The reporter told her she had important information to inform the chairman, the secretary said the chairman was not around.\n\nHow Headquarters collaborates with branches to defraud citizens and the Government\n\nThe reporter also put a call across to the numbers displayed on the facebook page of RSBIR identified as Joseph Iyeuma, a lady picked. This reporter asked the lady if students are to pay for TCC, and she said No with the submission of a school document. This confirms that Legbosi and Ibiere cheated taxpayers and converted taxpayers\u2019 monies to individual pockets.\n\nAgain, the reporter requested the method to dictate the authentic TCC document, and the Tax officer told the reporter to visit the TCC office at the Board headquarters, and this reporter revisited on Monday November 4, 2020.\n\nImmediately the reporter entered the reception, she asked one of the tax officers seated, the way to the TCC office, and the fair in complexion lady asked the reporter the reason for the visit. When the reporter told the officer she wanted to inquire about the authenticity of the TCC received, she was directed to the first floor.\n\nThis reporter also climbed the first floor, and the security lady on the first floor showed her the TCC office and she entered and walked straight to a young man seated close to the wall by the right, immediately you entered the TCC office. She told the tax officer that she wanted to confirm the authenticity of TCC she had gotten from other branches. \u201cMeet my boss\u201d, the tax officer said, pointing to a man at the extreme of the office.\n\nAnd, the reporter walked to the man who later identified himself as Leyiri. The reporter told Mr. Leyiri she wanted to confirm the authenticity of the TCC, he requested for the copy, and the reporter gave him the TCC she had collected from Ibiere Tonye at the revenue office at State Secretariat. He started typing a code from the TCC into his computer, afterwhich, he told the reporter to officially write to the Chairman that he is not in the position to confirm the authenticity.\n\nHaving seen several TCC on Leyiri's desk, this reporter asked him if all the TCC comes from his office. He said all TCC comes from his office after heads of the branches have done and confirmed all the process but \u201cthat is after the Chairman has approved\u201d, he said.\n\nHe told the reporter that the TCC is original. \u201cAre you scared, it is okay? Dont waste time going through the process of writing to the chairman\u201d, Leyiri said, discouraging the reporter with a smiling face. He lied. The TCC from IB is fake as it has no TIN on it. The documents including the bank receipts from Ibiere are fake. The reporter also confirmed from the bank that the teller is fake. Leyiri is also covering up the crime from tax officers cheating the government.\n\nHowever, if the TCC from Ibiere Tonye is authentic as claimed by Leyiri, that means tax officers at the Head of the Revenue Board collaborate with officers at various branches to defraud ignorant Nigerians and divert public funds into personal accounts against the government's directive thereby causing the government to lose billions.\n\nThis reporter also did not identify herself as a journalist when she revisited the Headquarters of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office to avoid harassment.\n\nDocuments: IB Fake Bank Receipt by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nDOCUMENTS: RBIR LEGBARA by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThis report is supported by HEDA Resource Agenda in collaboration with the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.",

          "title": "INVESTIGATION: How Rivers State Revenue Officers Divert Millions Of Government Funds Into Private Bank Accounts",
          "text": "In this three-month investigation, this reporter used a pseudonym name, Rose John, poses as a Diploma Student in Ken Polytechnic and paid a total sum of N195,000 to get a tax clearance certificate from two separate staff of Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue offices in Port Harcourt. However, out of the N195,000 paid, only N30,300 went into the coffers of the Rivers State Government. TCC office at the headquarters also collaborates with branch tax officers to cheat the Rivers Government. The reporter had disguised herself to look like the ignorant Nigerian which the tax officers took advantage of.\n\nThe Rivers State Government has several times warned tax officers to stop collecting cash from taxpayers. Rather, they should direct any payment to the Government designated bank, but the tax officers are illegally charging residents and then failing to remit to the government. This, they do in connivance with some bank officials.\n\nBetween August and September 2020, the Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike borrowed over N24billion to accelerate development which included construction of flyover, dualisation of road and compensation to families of demolished buildings among others. Nyesom said the fund will be repaid from the Internally Generated Revenue. What this means is that, with the constant IGR being diverted into an individual account, the Governor might not pay the loan on time. And this will affect development in the state.\n\nInside the Rivers State Secretariat, close to the Podium Block, there is a branch office of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office. Immediately the reporter got close to the entrance of the tax office, she was accosted by a dark female security lady, in blue and black trousers.\n\nThe security officer requested to know the office the reporter was heading to, and when the reporter told her she wanted to get a Tax Clearance Certificate, she was directed to a then pregnant lady called IB, chocolate in complexion.\n\nThe Discussion with IB\n\nThe reporter told IB that she wants to get a tax clearance for herself and her sister who is also a student, and it is part of a requirement to apply for a scholarship abroad. IB told her each TCC will cost N150,000 each, even when the reporter pleads that they want to use it to apply for a scholarship and they are yet to know their fate whether they will be chosen or not.\n\nThe reporter had earlier visited the state revenue branch at Aggrey Road, a fair in complexion officer told her Tax Clearance Certificate for students is free, and all she needed is to submit the school admission letter and payment of school fees receipt.\n\nBut, this is different from what the tax officer(IB) inside the state secretariat told the reporter.\n\n\u201cI will bring the price down to N100,000 each since it's for both\u201d, IB said. The reporter pleaded for the money to be reduced yet it wasn't. IB told the reporter that the amount mentioned, she will still go and discuss with her boss and plead with him to accept the amount.\n\nAfter much argument, the reporter requested IB to give her the state government's bank account number to make payment. IB bluntly told the reporter that she can't pay to the bank because they don't know her, rather she(IB) is the one the reporter needs to pay to the bank. This is contrary to what the Rivers State Government jingles says. The state government has severally said it has no agent representing the government in collection of taxes. The government has warned tax officers not to collect cash rather they should direct the payer to the bank.\n\nIB wanted cash but the reporter intentionally requested her bank account details.Happily, IB, gave the reporter her personal Guaranty Trust bank account details; Diri Ibieri Tonye. IB for short, came from Ibieri, our report understands. The reporter made a transaction of N80,000 on September 17,2020, and to also document cash received, this reporter called IB and informed her that she couldn't make the transfer again if she could bring cash immediately. Same day, the balance of N20,000.00 was given to Ibieri. This was also captured on camera.\n\nTax clearance certificate collected from IB without TIN.\n\nEvery taxpayer is expected to use their Rivers Tax Identification Number to pay their taxes. The reporter was hoping IB would request for RIVTIN but she didn't. Neither did she ask for a document to prove that the reporter\u2019s sister was a student.\n\nAlthough the reporter went with a computerised and edited scanned document as an Admission letter and an edited passport picked from the internet, IB failed to confirm if really the reporter is fake with intention to cheat the government. This act has been perpetrated by several scammers who cheat the government and most times in connivance with the staff of the Rivers Internal Revenue Board\n\nSurprisingly, two days after, IB called this reporter to come pick her tax-clearance certificate that it was ready. Ibieri persuaded the reporter to come to do the second TCC since the previous was ready. The reporter had told IB that once the TCC was ready, she would come to the second TCC for herself.\n\nThe reporter visited IB and she gave the reporter the Tax Clearance Certificate of 3years, starting from 2017, a hundred thousand Naira (N100,000) receipts from Internal Revenue Revenue, and also an stamped Access bank teller to prove to the reporter that she paid the money to the government designated bank as said earlier.\n\nTracking the Stamped Access Bank Teller\n\nThe location of the bank teller states Bank Road. Bank road is close to the state secretariat opposite the Rivers State Judiciary complex.\n\nThe reporter went into the bank to find out the authenticity of the bank teller. The first customer care she met was close to the entrance of the bank, a fair complexioned lady told the reporter, the bank teller is authentic.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see our stamp on it? said the Access bank customer care personnel, without confirming the authenticity of the receipt from the computer.\n\nBut the reporter insisted that she check the system before assuming the bank teller is authentic. The bank official reluctantly told the reporter to move to the extreme of the counter to meet the cashier for confirmation. And this reporter did.\n\n\u201cWhere did you pay this money? The receipt can't be found, said the bank cashier whom the reporter had handed over the bank teller given by the revenue officer, Ibieri. The reporter told her the revenue officer gave her the teller that the money was paid in this branch.\n\nThe reporter insisted the bank cashier should check using the name on the teller, the number and the stamp yet the bank cashier insisted that all had been done yet she could not see any of the names used in payment and the teller number was not recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, Diri Ibieri Tonye used Rose John as given by the reporter to pay the money. What this means is that the N100,000 the reporter paid for Tax Clearance was not paid to the government's bank account; rather, it was paid to the Tax officer of Rivers State Internal revenue board.\n\nThe bank teller and computer printout given to the reporter by IB were also fake, and this can be possible with the help of a bank official.\n\nOn a separate day, the reporter visited the Rumuogba board of Internal Revenue close to Mini-okoro police station. Immediately she entered the reception by the right is an office occupied by two tax officers, a man and a fair woman.\n\nThe reporter moved to the first person, a dark man and told him she wanted to get a tax clearance and he pointed to the other lady, fair in complexion, who identified herself as Legbosi.\n\nLegbosi was attending to a customer, immediately the reporter met her and told her she wanted TCC for herself and her sister, and they are students. This reporter made her aware of the urgency of the TCC to enable her to apply for a scholarship abroad. Immediately, Legbosi brought out a pen, wrote down her telephone contact and told the reporter to go home and call her at 4pm. Earlier, Legbosi had told the reporter to get the school admission letter, ID card and receipt. The reporter, knowing she can't easily get the school ID card, she quickly told Legbosi that she is yet to be given an ID card from the school since 2018.\n\nThis reporter was disguised and looked unkempt when she visited Legbosi's office and pretended to be among the ignorant Nigerians. So, Legbosi, a senior tax officer, decided to take advantage of her looks to cheat her.\n\nIn the evening, this reporter called Legbosi who told her to pay N150,000 after much pleading, the reporter stood her ground on N95,000 and the tax officer, Legbosi agreed. It took over two months before Legbosi agreed for N95,000. This was when the reporter suddenly visited the tax office and told her what they agreed on the phone was N95,000. Legbosi could not remember how much she had told the reporter.\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the reporter visited the tax office, hoping that the state government account would be given to make payment. Legbosi requested cash. The reporter told her to give the state account to make payment but Legbosi said the money was to be paid to her while she would pay to the bank. Just like her colleague Ibiere at the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office inside the state secretariat.\n\nThe reporter requested her bank account and she refused and told the reporter to go across the office and do a withdrawal. Outside the office is the police microfinance bank. The reporter went outside and withdrew the N90,000 and intentionally left N5,000 to be transferred into Legbosi bank to have proof.\n\nTCC collected from Legbosi with TIN\n\nImmediately, the reporter brought out the cash to give Legbosi, she brought out an envelope and requested the cash to be put inside. Our reporter put the cash inside and handed over the money to Legbosi, and told her the ATM failed to transfer the remaining N5,000 if she can share her account details for the balance to be paid. And she did it on a sheet and this reporter transferred the N5,000 balance.\n\nThe Rivers Board of Internal Revenue has also announced that acquiring a Tax Identification number is free, and it is also stated on her facebook page. Legbos asked the reporter to pay two Thousand to get RIVTIN before payment of the Tax payment to get a TCC.\n\nUnfortunately for Legbosi, the reporter had visited the Head office of the State revenue Board as regards TIN and it was done free. The reporter told Legbosi that her sister has a TIN. Legbosi shockingly looked at the reporter but she still couldn't understand the naive lady in front of her. The reporter gave her the TIN\n\nUnfortunately, the reporter didn't notice the money was short of N10,000 and Legbosi called the reporter and informed her. The reporter checked the bag where she brought out the money and saw the extra N10,000. The reporter again requested the tax officer to text her bank details to transfer extra N10,000.\n\nLegbosi sent a text of her Savings First bank account details; Legbosi Ikpabie. This reporter paid and she confirmed seeing the money via text message.\n\nUnlike IB who did not ask for a document to prove that the reporter's relative was a student; Legbosi asked. And the reporter gave her a fake Admission letter, school fees receipt all picked from the internet and edited, and a fake home address.\n\nGetting TCC at Rumuogba\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Legbosi texted the reporter that the TCC is ready. Days after, the reporter visited Legbosi at the tax office and collected the TCC. Only N30,300 was reflected on the receipt given.\n\nEarlier, Legbosi called and told the reporter that out of the N95,000 paid, N50,000 had no receipt, claiming the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office does not give receipt for penalty. She claimed the N50,000 was for penalty for failure to pay tax. Meanwhile, Legbosi never told the reporter that N50,000 would be used for the penalty. She lied again. All monies paid for any purpose in the state had a receipt especially when it was said to be paid into the bank.\n\nThe bank teller brought by Legbosi only reflected N30,300 not the N95,000 as claimed earlier.\n\nThe reporter through her TIN checked the amount paid by Legbosi online, only N30,300 was reflected, and the N50,000 penalty was never stated\n\nRIVERS STATE BOARD OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RSB\n\nRIRS Head Office\n\nRSBIR on her facebook page said it is committed to being the credible Tax Administrator and helping the good people of Rivers State understand and become responsible TAX PAYERS.\n\nThe State Government has made several efforts to ensure residents and businesses owners pay their taxes into the right bank. However, this is done through jingles in various media outlets but there are some ignorant people who would still go to the board office and seek direction to confirm the amount needed to be paid. Rather than the Revenue officers to give direction on the right payment, some officers like Legbosi and IB will still deceive and illegally charge residents yet fail to remit to the government.\n\nThe official website of the RIvers State Board rolled out banks where taxpayers can make payment. The reporter visited the headquarters of the State Revenue board at Trans-Amai to speak with the Executive Chairman, Adoage Norteh to inform her findings. The secretary to the Chairman, an advanced woman denied the report access.\n\nWhen the reporter visited State Revenue headquarters on Friday 27, October, 2020, about 1pm, some security officers told the reporter that the Chairman was in his office. The reporter introduced herself and told the secretary that she has information for the chairman. And the secretary asked the reporter if she was on appointment, the reporter said, No, and the Chairman\u2019s secretary replied, \u201cThen, you can\u2019t see him\u201d. The reporter told her she had important information to inform the chairman, the secretary said the chairman was not around.\n\nHow Headquarters collaborates with branches to defraud citizens and the Government\n\nThe reporter also put a call across to the numbers displayed on the facebook page of RSBIR identified as Joseph Iyeuma, a lady picked. This reporter asked the lady if students are to pay for TCC, and she said No with the submission of a school document. This confirms that Legbosi and Ibiere cheated taxpayers and converted taxpayers\u2019 monies to individual pockets.\n\nAgain, the reporter requested the method to dictate the authentic TCC document, and the Tax officer told the reporter to visit the TCC office at the Board headquarters, and this reporter revisited on Monday November 4, 2020.\n\nImmediately the reporter entered the reception, she asked one of the tax officers seated, the way to the TCC office, and the fair in complexion lady asked the reporter the reason for the visit. When the reporter told the officer she wanted to inquire about the authenticity of the TCC received, she was directed to the first floor.\n\nThis reporter also climbed the first floor, and the security lady on the first floor showed her the TCC office and she entered and walked straight to a young man seated close to the wall by the right, immediately you entered the TCC office. She told the tax officer that she wanted to confirm the authenticity of TCC she had gotten from other branches. \u201cMeet my boss\u201d, the tax officer said, pointing to a man at the extreme of the office.\n\nAnd, the reporter walked to the man who later identified himself as Leyiri. The reporter told Mr. Leyiri she wanted to confirm the authenticity of the TCC, he requested for the copy, and the reporter gave him the TCC she had collected from Ibiere Tonye at the revenue office at State Secretariat. He started typing a code from the TCC into his computer, afterwhich, he told the reporter to officially write to the Chairman that he is not in the position to confirm the authenticity.\n\nHaving seen several TCC on Leyiri's desk, this reporter asked him if all the TCC comes from his office. He said all TCC comes from his office after heads of the branches have done and confirmed all the process but \u201cthat is after the Chairman has approved\u201d, he said.\n\nHe told the reporter that the TCC is original. \u201cAre you scared, it is okay? Dont waste time going through the process of writing to the chairman\u201d, Leyiri said, discouraging the reporter with a smiling face. He lied. The TCC from IB is fake as it has no TIN on it. The documents including the bank receipts from Ibiere are fake. The reporter also confirmed from the bank that the teller is fake. Leyiri is also covering up the crime from tax officers cheating the government.\n\nHowever, if the TCC from Ibiere Tonye is authentic as claimed by Leyiri, that means tax officers at the Head of the Revenue Board collaborate with officers at various branches to defraud ignorant Nigerians and divert public funds into personal accounts against the government's directive thereby causing the government to lose billions.\n\nThis reporter also did not identify herself as a journalist when she revisited the Headquarters of the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue office to avoid harassment.\n\nDocuments: IB Fake Bank Receipt by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nDOCUMENTS: RBIR LEGBARA by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nThis report is supported by HEDA Resource Agenda in collaboration with the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism.",

          "title": "Helping Nigeria overcome the medical tourism malady",
          "text": "BY ADEOLUWA OGUNRINDE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former colleague, on the advice of his family doctor, decided to seek medical care in the US for his wife preparing to deliver their first baby. The medic had warned them of a potentially high-risk life-threatening complication. Nigeria\u2019s healthcare system was parlous then; public hospitals were termed \u2018consulting centres\u2019.\n\nThe high-cost trip forced the young man to sell off assets: land, car and home appliances. Though the wife delivered successfully, he has yet to recover from the expenses incurred years after.\n\nMedical tourism, a term used to describe people travelling abroad to obtain medical treatment, has become a key reference point in Nigeria\u2019s under-development trajectory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal ministry of health and experts like Prof. Ibraheem Adeoti Katibi, Dean, College of Health Sciences, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), and a PriceWaterhouseCoopers report disclosed that an average of 500 Nigerians travel abroad monthly to seek medical treatment while the country loses about $1.3 billion annually in terms of foreign exchange.\n\nOver the years, the number of Nigerians travelling to the US, UK, India, China, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and other developed countries for the treatment of cancer, kidney or liver transplant, heart or cardiac surgeries, neurosurgeries, cosmetic surgeries, routine check-up and baby deliveries, has been on the rise.\n\nThere is nothing morally wrong in seeking medicare abroad for certain critical ailments that can be better handled elsewhere due to the dearth of facilities and specialists locally, though. The penchant for medical tourism by Nigerians, has somewhat, assumed a worrisome dimension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are many downsides of medical tourism in our nation: these include lack of/inadequate investment in our hospitals and health infrastructure resulting in poor service delivery at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels.\n\nPeople from low socio-economic backgrounds who require foreign medical treatment for critical health conditions, often face hardship in raising the huge financial cost associated with such trips.\n\nNigeria also loses huge foreign exchange that could have been deployed to revamp our ageing hospitals and create jobs.\n\nMedical tourism also leads to the migration of medical and health professionals abroad with at least 8,178 medical doctors of Nigerian origin working in the UK, according to the UK General Medical Council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProf. Katibi while decrying medical tourism said, Nigeria was blessed with competent and well-trained experts, and that over $1 billion spent annually on medical care abroad could provide better healthcare services in Nigeria if invested locally.\n\n\u201cWe have to rise up to the challenge and tackle the problem of medical tourism,\u201d he noted.\n\nA transplant surgeon, Dr Nadey Hakim, also advocated improving national healthcare facilities, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see why any Nigerian patients should go outside Nigeria to have a transplant when we can do it for them in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nMotivated by patriotism, some Nigerians recently took practical steps to stem the age-long malaise with the launch and opening of Marcelle Ruth Cancer Centre and Specialist Hospital in Lagos, supported by Polaris Bank, which provided the platform for the partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMRCC is the first-of-kind, world-class, multipurpose-built and one-stop centre for the comprehensive treatment of specific cancers namely: breast, gynaecological, prostate, colorectal, and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which are the most common cancers in Nigeria.\n\nMRCC boasts qualified specialists with local and international experiences and offers specialist services including urology, sickle cell research, and stem cell transplant, which are largely unavailable in Nigeria.\n\nIt houses an imaging centre with CT, mammogram, ultrasound, x-ray machines, modern laboratory services, two operating theatres, an eight-bed chemotherapy suite, a radiotherapy centre with a linear accelerator and brachytherapy, 15 private en-suite rooms for in-patients, pharmacy and counselling service.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who was the special guest of honour, applauded the noble initiative as a big step towards reversing medical tourism malaise in Nigeria. He acknowledged the need for collaboration to institutionalise a viable and robust health sector for the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe described MRCC as a story of courage, resilience, forthrightness, tenacity and the willingness not to give up.\n\nIn a demonstration of the state government\u2019s commitment to quality healthcare delivery for the people, Sanwo-Olu announced that a specialist cancer centre would be established by the government within the next 12 months to complement MRCC and the oncology centre in LUTH.\n\n\u2018\u2018Looking at the statistics, we need ten more of Specialist Cancer Centre just to scratch the surface based on the number of cancer patients we are seeing. This is part of the medical infrastructure transformation project we are working on which cuts across all the disciplines of health \u2013 primary, secondary and tertiary,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nChairman of MRCC, Mr Bolaji Odunsi, commended Polaris Bank and other partners in both the public and private sectors for their strategic role in making the vision of the hospital, a reality.\n\nAcknowledging the contribution of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Polaris Bank, he said, \u201cWe have been beneficiaries of the Covid-related healthcare intervention fund, and in particular we want to mention the support of Polaris Bank that helped us navigate the process. Without them, things would have been a lot more difficult.\u201d\n\nThe visioner and Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. (Mrs.) Modupe Elebute-Odunsi, thanked those that have been part of the journey over the 30 years, describing Marcelle Ruth Cancer Centre and Specialist Hospital as a hospital aiming to achieve international gold standards.\n\nShe re-echoed Governor Sanwo-Olu\u2019s vision of reversing medical tourism saying, \u201cMr Governor, I must say that we share your vision and your passion to reverse medical tourism in Nigeria. We need to do it together, between the private and public sectors because this is the time.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe launch of MRCC drew top dignitaries from all walks of life including foremost industrialist, Aliko Dangote; Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; First Lady of Lagos State, Dr. (Mrs.) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, and her Kebbi & Ondo state counterparts Dr. (Mrs.) Zainab Bagudu and Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu respectively, and Mrs Toyin Saraki, wife of the immediate past Senate President.\n\nOgunrinde, a journalist, data & research analyst, is a post-graduate student of mass communication, University of Lagos",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",
          "summary": "In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem.\nNupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa.\nThe Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering).\nThe startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation.",

          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I learned two things about the man. He wants more people to have access to financial services regardless of what form of financing they currently have.\n\nAnd he really loves to swim.\n\nWhen we talked about swimming, I asked if it was something he considered doing professionally.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at swimming, it\u2019s something I do to relax \u2013 for fun. Basketball was what I thought I was going to go pro in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three years since he last played basketball. But in that time he\u2019s been hard at work building Seerbit, a payment platform focused on the underserved segments of the African market.\n\nRecently, Seerbit entered into a partnership with Wix, the platform helping people build websites without needing coding experience. This partnership means that payments on Wix websites in Africa pass through Seerbit.\n\nAs Co-founder/CEO of Seerbit, this is one of many ways he is trying to help businesses across Africa reach as many people as they can \u2013 from easy website creation to a myriad of payment options for customers.\n\nHis name is Omoniyi Kolade and this is his life in tech.\n\nWhen he knew\u2026\n\nEveryone talks about the moment they knew what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\nFor some people this moment comes very early \u2013 an engineer may tell you it was the first time she ever saw LEGO bricks as a kid. For some others, it comes at the cusp of adulthood, just as adolescence starts to fade.\n\nThe former is where Omoniyi falls. His realisation came sometime during his penultimate year in the university.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Ilorin, a city in Western Nigeria, founded in 1450. Of his parents\u2019 four children, he was the only one who pursued his higher education in Nigeria.\n\nBefore he went on to study Computer with Electronics at Lead City University, Omoniyi had a friend who had been taking courses on the Microsoft Office suite and would return each day to tell him about what they learned. Soon he also decided to apply to a cyber cafe offering computer lessons in networking.\n\nThis, he says, \u201cis where the curiosity started from.\u201d\n\nBut curiosity is only good for killing cats; knowing that a path is yours to take is a different ball game.\n\nThis \u201cknowing\u201d happened during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) program \u2013 which is basically compulsory work experience in the year before your final year at university in Nigeria.\n\nDuring this time he worked with a startup that helped set up networks for former banking giant Oceanic Bank. During his time there, he discovered interesting telecom solutions that only available or provided by foreign companies. He wanted to replicate those solutions for the Nigerian market.\n\nHe told his friends about his cool idea and they tried to get it off the ground but were unable to get much traction.\n\nSoon SIWES came to an end and it was back to school for Omoniyi and his friends. But something had changed.\n\n\u201cWhile trying to analyse the dynamics of the market, it really shifted my mindset. It wasn\u2019t clear what direction I wanted to offer services in, but I knew I wanted to offer a technology solution.\u201d\n\nPay attention to the people\n\nWhen he was done obtaining his first degree, Omoniyi returned to the world of tech determined to make it work this time. The area he chose to conquer? Customer Relations.\n\nTogether with some friends, he set up a company that was focused on providing CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solutions to financial institutions. He\u2019d noticed that there was a gap that wasn\u2019t being addressed: banks were creating products for consumers they knew next to nothing about.\n\nThis was a problem that cut across several sectors so Omoniyi and his partners knew that the terrain was theirs to conquer. His company provided solutions from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and also built custom solutions to help these companies keep track of their customers.\n\nAround this time, mobile money started to gain some popularity across the country and his team decided it was time to work with companies who had acquired a license for mobile money.\n\nTo these companies, Omoniyi\u2019s value proposition was simple; they\u2019d been working in the CRM space for a while and for mobile money to flourish it was important for these organisations to know their customers and how they live.\n\nWhen he tells me the story of this period, I find that his involvement in the early mobile money era didn\u2019t stop with trying to provide CRM solutions \u2013 he was also actively involved in helping set up agency networks across the country \u2013 dressed to the nines in his joggers and trainers.\n\nProviding solutions for customer relations began the journey but in working closely with financial institutions, Omoniyi found a gap he could fill with Seerbit. He wanted to facilitate payment without boundaries \u2013 a way for people to pay however they were able to.\n\nI now pronounce you online and offline\n\nToday, Seerbit is active in eight African countries and for Omoniyi the key is to help businesses receive payments from their customers in various forms \u2013 both online and offline.\n\nWhen I ask him about what the business means to him, he tells me \u201cIt\u2019s all about the impact of what we are doing. Seeing pain points removed from merchants on our platform.\u201d\n\nSeerbit\u2019s merchants can receive payments through online payments, mobile money, USSD, cards and of course, cash.\n\nAs his goal is to not disenfranchise anyone, Omoniyi has made it a point to allow customers to pay for products in the way that they are most used to \u2013 he believes this is how true financial inclusion will be achieved. Not by throwing people into new waters but by meeting them in the places that they are and opening them up to all the many possibilities.\n\nWith Seerbit, Omoniyi could present an avenue for merchants to meet their customers in new ways.",

          "text": "The e-commerce giant, Jumia saw its share prices nosedive to $21.15 ahead of the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2021. It is the company\u2019s lowest share price this year after a market rally saw it hit an all-time high of $65.51.\n\nThe market reacted negatively to the results and it points to the possibility of a share price nosedive after Jumia\u2019s Q1 2021 results showed revenue of $33 million, down 6.4% from $35 million in Q1 2020. Despite this, by the company\u2019s estimation, \u201cOur first-quarter results reflect solid progress towards profitability.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s Q1 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which measures all the goods sold on the platform, was $200 million, which is down 13% from the same period last year. Despite this reduction, it is not a big worry because Jumia has repositioned its business and now primarily sells household products that cost a lot less money than high-ticket items.\n\nIt means that no matter how many items the company sells, as long as they are household items that are cheaper than laptops and phones, its GMV will be small compared to earlier years.\n\nThe bright spots\n\nThere are a few bright spots in the company\u2019s report, such as an increase in its gross profit after fulfilment. The gross profit after fulfilment shows that the company is making money each time it makes a delivery, which is a vast improvement.\n\nFulfilment expense decreased by 11% in the first quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis. This was down to a change in the delivery pricing model from cost per package to cost per stop, which was implemented from the second quarter of 2020.\n\nFor years, Jumia made a loss on each delivery it made because of inefficiencies and a first-party marketplace where it bought and sold goods directly to customers.\n\nThanks to a third-party marketplace model that is now the more significant part of its business, vendors list their products, sell them, and Jumia collects a commission. Those commissions are now up to $9.2 million, increasing 8.8% from the same period last year.\n\nOther bright spots include an increase in the number of annual active customers to 6.9 million, increasing from 6.4 million customers from the same period last year.\n\nBut the most crucial positive in the Q1 report is the reduction in the company\u2019s operating losses. For Q1, losses stood at $41 million, down from $53.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nThere are other aspects of Jumia\u2019s business where it sees some improvement, such as Jumia Food and Jumia Pay.\n\nJumiaPay remains popular and now offers personal loans\n\nIn 2019, Nasdaq said, \u201cJumiaPay, the company\u2019s payment processing solution, presents a huge opportunity.\u201d Since then, observers have kept an eye on JumiaPay\u2019s Total Payments Volume (TPV).\n\nTPV increased by 21% from $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $52.2 million in Q1 2021. JumiaPay was created to help solve the inefficiencies created by customers often opting to want to pay cash.\n\nOverall, 36.7% of orders placed on the Jumia platform in the first quarter of 2021 were completed using JumiaPay, compared to 35.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Those 2.4 million transactions mean that Jumia has quite a bit of data.\n\nIt has used that data to offer loans to merchants, a solution which it talked up in the media. Yet, its newer personal loan offering has gone under the radar, with a company official declining to answer questions about it from TechCabal. The personal loan offering looks to be in partnership with the digital lender QuickCheck.\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a logical next step for JumiaPay to give loans as it continues its ambitions to become some type of fintech play that\u2019s independent of the Jumia marketplace.",

          "text": "Merchants such as StarTimes, Ethiopia Airlines, Kenya Airways are collecting payments digitally in Nigeria using Tingg- Cellulant\u2019s digital payments platform.\n\nMore than 70% of businesses in Africa are small or medium businesses and, 90% of these businesses collect payments in cash and lack digital payment options that cater to their customers. For example, in Nigeria, small and medium enterprises contribute roughly 48% of GDP, yet many lack digital tools for transactions.\n\nWhile the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on African economies, this crisis has also become the single most significant catalyst for a digital transformation. For all businesses \u2013 small, medium, large- digitising has moved from a good to have to a game-changer in what has become the new norm.\n\nTingg- Digital Payment Platform Powering Businesses to Sell More\n\nCellulant has simplified their product, unifying their offering into Tingg- a digital payments platform enabling businesses to seamlessly accept payments from their customers. Tingg makes it easy for businesses to conveniently and affordably accept payments with fewer hoops. For merchants using Tingg, their customers can make payments for goods and services using locally relevant payment options.\n\nA single integrated solution, Tingg addresses the complex needs of managing payments for a business by making it easy to collect and make payments with the best customer experience.\n\nTingg aims to boost growth for businesses by standardising the payment experience for the end-user and simplifies the tools and processes for a merchant to manage their collections.\n\nSolving for Payment Fragmentation\n\nMobile money adoption has increased rapidly over recent years, especially in markets where most of the population remains unbanked. According to Statista, in 2020, 10% of digital payments in Nigeria were transacted through e-wallets. In addition, NIBBSS recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators processed over 655 million Point-of-Sale (POS) transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion) in 2020. This presents a 50% increase from the previous year.\n\nNigerian consumers have different payment options, including card, mobile money, bank transfer and cash- with volatile currency fluctuations and no single settlement framework. Furthermore, the demand for digital payments continues to increase. Today, roughly 50% of retail customers request to pay for their purchases using digital payment options. However, this demand presents several challenges for most merchants who might not always support the customer\u2019s preferred payment method, resulting in merchants having to enable multiple solutions to support multiple wallets. In addition, multiple payment methods mean having to manage various merchant tools, accounts, and varying processes for settlement and reversals for a merchant.\n\nTingg solves this fragmentation challenge by focusing on delivering a graceful user experience for the merchant and their customer and provide;-\n\nOne solution to accept all digital payment methods (Bank Transfers, USSD payments & Mobile Money)\n\nOne portal to view payments received from multiple payment methods\n\nA single settlement from multiple payment sources that is automated\n\nA simplified reconciliation and dispute management tools\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy won\u2019t bounce back or grow until both small and large businesses across all industries are able to recover and thrive from the impact of Covid and overall market fluctuations. Therefore, as the customers continue to demand for better payment experiences, businesses need all the support that payment providers such a Cellulant can offer to promote sustainable economic growth.\n\nwww.tingg.Africa",

We are all leaders and we are in this together. The solution must come from us regardless of what level of government we are \u2013 whether at the federal, state or even at the local government level,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nLawan also frowned at the way and manner local government system was relegated to the background in the country, saying for the nation to address its security challenges the local government system must be functional and efficient.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity also to say that we have diminished the local government system. I think we can attribute some of the security issues to the lack of functional local government system.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the time has come for us to take up the challenge to ensure that the local government system functions. This is in keeping with looking for ways, for means, for solutions to the security challenges that we face. We must never neglect the local government system.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is one system that had worked even though in a different name. When it was Native Authority it was very effective, very efficient.\n\n\u201cSo, we must go back to our local government to ensure that the local government continues to be autonomous, continues to be functional in order to compliment whatever the States and the Federal Government would be doing.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who also spoke to the correspondents, called for a national spirit of oneness, saying that \u201cIf truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame for what\u2019s happening today.\n\n\u201cWhatever challenges we have, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve these issues we\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cWe must imbibe that spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity and love that would take us through this.\u201d\n\nHe enjoined Nigerians to always be their brothers\u2019 keepers and avoid acts capable of creating social unrest.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City, Nigeria\u2026Over 30 Nigerian Civil Society organisations have opposed the Archbishop of Canterbury support for Shell Carbon Energy Plan, and have requested the Archbishop to withdraw such support for a favourable Church of England position.\n\nIn a letter of 10th May 2021 signed by over 30 civil society organisations, convener of the groups, the Rev David Ugolor ANEEJ said that even though the organisation agree with the Archbishop that \u2018we all have moral and financial responsibility to address the climate emergency\u2019, they are \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 and \u2018concerned\u2019 that the Church of England\u2019s Pension Board is lending its moral and financial authority to Shell, and plans to vote for Shell\u2019s climate and energy plan at its 2021 Annual Meeting.\n\n\u2018Nigeria has deep experience with Shell, and as representatives of Nigerian citizens\u2019 groups we wish to tell you that we feel that the company is the opposite of accountable to most Nigerians, and has a track record of making misleading statements and commitments. Shell should not be rewarded for setting a long-term ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nWe need urgent action now, starting this year. It is not acceptable for the Church to sign off on a Shell plan for this decade that makes no absolute carbon emission reduction pledges, includes huge increases in gas production, and relies on improbably large amounts of tree-planting. Indeed, Shell\u2019s rush to find land for \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 might well lead to further carbon colonialism, slavery and human rights violations in the global south. Aiming for net-zero carbon emissions has become another effort by polluting entities like Shell to avoid cutting emissions but rather continue in the harmful practices that drive global warming.\n\nNet zero is not zero emissions. It simply means polluting and assuming the equivalent amount of carbon is absorbed by trees or is mechanically captured and stored by an assortment of risky and unregulated geo-engineering proposals. Endorsing Shell\u2019s plan is akin to handing the corporation a right to toy with planetary systems while the poor and vulnerable continue to fight a losing battle against global warming\u2019, the CSO letter to The Most Revd. Justin Welby read.\n\nThe groups said that they strongly disagree with the Church of England position that the Shell goal on Carbon Emissions is \u2018clear and unambiguous, and Shell is accountable for delivering that target\u201d.\n\nThe letter to Archbishop Justin Welby said that because the Church of England has an important voice in the world on many topics, it must take responsibility to lead engagement with the company on behalf of the Climate Action 100+, an initiative involving over 500 investors worth $54 trillion.\n\n\u2018With the effects of climate change more visible every year, the future of our children is at stake, in Nigeria, Africa and around the world. We hope that you hear our call, and take urgent steps to ensure that the church reconsiders its position on Shell. Endorsing the cynical climate plan offered by Shell would mean believing that Earth systems operate according to the principles of calculus and negates the truth that the Earth is a wonderfully created system of interdependent and complex systems that no man can control by mechanical contraptions or imaginations for the sole aim of meeting shareholder\u2019s pleasure. We urge you to use all the tools available to you to encourage all parts of the Church of England to challenge Shell, rather than champion the corporation\u2019s climate and energy plan.\n\nWe pray you to continue to support our demands for ecological justice and the protection of our environment and will be happy to continue the dialogue with you as we look forward to a positive response\u2019, the letter to Archbishop Welby stated.\n\nCivil Society organisations that signed the petition against the Church of England support for Shell Climate Reduction Plan include:\n\n1.

It is hoped that at the end of first phase of the project, 4250 indigenes of Edo State will be empowered. The LIFE-ND is aimed at enhancing the income, food security and job creation for youths and women in rural areas of the Niger Delta,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr. Peter Aikhuomobhogbe said \u201cThe project is geared towards supporting women and youths in agricultural enterprises.

          "text": "By John Kokome\n\nThis is a clarion call to all Nigerians irrespective of age, gender, tribe, religion, political affiliation; it is time for us to come together to make this country work again. We may not always agree on all issues, but for ones let us agree to make Nigeria work.\n\nAlthough tribes and tongues may differ in brotherhood we stand as one, in order to lead the way for other African countries to follow suit. The only hope Africa as a continent has is that, Nigeria will one day lead the way for the liberation of the continent economically and politically. Our country is indeed a force to be reckoned with not just in Africa but the world. Therefore, we must change the ugly narrative of disunity among our people to be able to provide the much-expected leadership for the continent. However, we must set our house in order; charity they say begins at home.\n\nTherefore, we must put our differences aside, and focus on the bigger picture which is to building a heterogeneous society; where the oppressed will no longer be oppressed, where there will be equal right, fairness and justice for all, where no one will be discriminated against based on his or her tongue, where the majority and the minority will both have their say on how the country is governed, where as citizens we will be able to live freely in any part of the without any fear of threat to life and property.\n\nHowever, it is reassuring to see leaders rising up to speak on the need to chart a new course for the country. I am particularly, impressed by the resolution reached by the Southern Governors during their recent meeting in Asaba, Delta State to lend their voices on the way forward for the country. We hope this will not be a mere talk, but marched with the required action plan for us to see the result. The Governors must endeavor to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d for them to be taken seriously.\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, I look forward to seeing their counter-parts from the North to do the same in the interest of the country. This is a collective responsibility we all owe the country. No matter your political, economic, religious or social status, you and I have a role to play in rebuilding our country to a more peaceful and prosperous nation to the delight of our people, the African continent and indeed, the international community. Nigeria is currently bleeding but we have a duty to as a people to stop the bleeding by our actions and inactions. This is our home; we have no choice than to make it work again.\n\nThere is only one solution to the multifaceted problems beleaguering this country and once the solution is applied, every other thing will naturally fall in place. Restructure! Restructure!! Restructure!!!\n\nLet the restructuring process begin in earnest. I leave us with the famous song by Chief Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye aka King Sunny Ade:\n\nCome make we lift am o!\n\nLift make I lift\n\nCome, make we lift Nigeria up\n\nLift, make I lift\n\nThis Nigeria na we own\n\nMake e no pafuka\n\nNo place wey be like our home\n\nHome, sweet home\n\nMake we join hands and think alike\n\nLift make I lift\u2026!\n\nJohn Kokome\n\nA Communications Strategist & Public Affairs Analyst writes from Lagos\n\n[email protected]",

          "text": "Data from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has shown that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry growth declined by 19.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.\n\nThe organisation in a country-by-country analysis of developments within its member countries in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), said the previous month, it fell by 13.9 per cent, although the non-oil sector grew by 1.7 per cent.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria\u2019s real GDP grew by 0.1 per cent year-on-year in Q4, 2020, following a 3.6 per cent contraction in Q3, 2020, which was the first positive quarterly growth in the last three quarters amid the gradual return of economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil sector expanded 1.7 per cent, recovering from a 2.5 per cent decline in 3Q,2020, mainly driven by growth in the telecommunications and information services sectors,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cOther important contributions came from the agricultural sector, which expanded by 3.4 per cent y-o-y in 4Q, 2020. Meanwhile, the oil sector dropped by 19.8 per cent y-o-y after a 13.9 per cent y-o-y contraction in 3Q, 2020,\u201d the report for May stated.\n\nThe report noted that in 2020, the economy contracted 1.9 per cent y-o-y, following a 2.3 per cent y-o-y expansion in 2019, while inflation was still structurally high in the first quarter of this year, with the annual inflation rate jumping to 18.17 per cent in March 2021, the highest rate since January 2017 amid the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has also weakened the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, a surge in oil output by Russia and Oman in April lowered the compliance rate to the OPEC+ production cuts, with the nine non-OPEC countries that participate in the cuts overproducing by 347,000 barrels per day, equating to a compliance rate of 85 per cent, the lowest level for the 12 months that the pact had been in force, according to ThisDay report.\n\nCompliance among the 10 participating OPEC countries, by contrast, was 123 per cent, thanks largely to the Saudis\u2019 additional voluntary reduction of one million bpd in February-April, which came on top of its official OPEC+ cut of 1.88 million bpd.\n\nThe average compliance rate for the entire OPEC+ group fell to 110 per cent in April from a record high of 113 per cent in March.\n\nThe non-OPEC partners\u2019 poor performance is certain to aggravate the Saudis and other Mideast and African producers, which have hit their targets in recent months which could create a tense atmosphere during future negotiations about opening the taps in the second half of the year.\n\nSaudi Arabia is looking to unwind its voluntary cut of one million bpd in May-July, which will necessitate winning back market share that it ceded in Asia when the voluntary cut was enacted in February.\n\nAlso, oil prices dropped by almost three per cent yesterday and were set for the biggest percentage drop since early April, after the restart of Colonial Pipeline, eased some of the concerns about petrol shortages in the U.S. East.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, West Texas International crude was falling by 2.94 per cent at $64.14 while Brent Crude was down by 2.64 per cent at $67.49.\n\nOil prices snapped the winning streak from earlier this week when reports from both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reiterated the view that global oil demand would rebound strongly in the second half of the year with more economies reopening and increased travel amid higher vaccination rates.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s bullish outlook on demand, coupled with a similar view from OPEC from Tuesday, sent oil prices to an eight-week high on Wednesday, almost hitting $70.",

Each governor pledged and swore to an oath and they emphasised loyalty to the sovereignty of this country. They pledged their loyalty to the President of the country.\n\nThat\u2019s their oath of office.\n\n\u201cWhile we accept the fact that we have various forms of association and freedom of expression as citizens, they have failed to express their views through the right channel.\n\nThey are members of the National Council of State. Every governor is a member of the NCS.\n\nIt also included former presidents who are still living. There is no better forum at their level to take a joint decision than such forum.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they have taking a decision as a divisive move, does not speak well of their intention. I feel it is a betrayal of trust. I think they are just playing to gallery. What they are saying is not new.\n\nThey are like broken record, saying the same thing over and over again. Why can\u2019t they come to the appropriate body which is the National Assembly to project their ideas?.\n\n\u201cThey have members in the National Assembly who are representing them, if they have an issue that is so important as that, which borders on the constitution of the country, they should go there and express their grievances.\n\nWe would sit, debate it and see how best we can come out of it. There can\u2019t be Nigeria if everyone wants to have things happen in his or her own way.\n\n\u201cThere is a constitution and there is a framework that we are supposed to operate as governors. To go outside it is a betrayal of their oath of office.\n\nEach of them talking there, if you take a look at what is happening in their individual states, they cannot in all honesty and good conscience, challenge Buhari.\n\n\u201cJust take them one by one and see what they are doing in their states and what the people who voted for them are undergoing, is it Buhari that caused it?\n\nDid Buhari withhold their federation account allocation? Did Buhari collect their internal revenue? It is just enough of this nonsense.\n\n\u201cI respect my colleagues, when we talk either in the Senate or House of Representatives, we listen to one another.\n\nAnybody who wants restructuring should bring his proposal to the National Assembly as a private member bill. They have members who would bring it up.\n\nI wonder why educated people, some of whom are lawyers, would just want to make noise to divert attention.\n\nOur eyes are on the ball and they would remain on the ball. They can go on talking, Nigeria will remain a united country.\u201d\n\nThe senator also expressed disappointment in groups and ethnic nationalities making secessionist move, stressing that such agitation is uncalled for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed in those subversive elements calling for separation from Nigeria at a time when everybody should bow before their creator and pray for peace to reign in our land.\n\n\u201cThose clamouring for separation and secession in this country will fail by the grace of God because they do know as a matter of reality that their peace and prosperity is dependent on the stability and continued existence of Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t succeed as smaller nations. We have to find a way of understanding ourselves as citizens so that we can work together,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, criticized Nigerians for the failing insecurity across Nigeria and the widespread bad governance the citizens complain about.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s media aide Femi Adesina shifted the blame for the country\u2019s woes from the Peoples Democratic Party to evil forces sitting on Mr Buhari\u2019s matter.\n\nBut Mr Gbajabiamila, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, put the blame on Nigerians for their current dilemma.\n\n\u201cIf truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame for what\u2019s happening today,\u201d said Mr Gbajabiamila.\n\nImplying that Nigerians are divided under Mr Buhari\u2019s regime, he urged, \u201cWhatever challenges we have, we must all come together to make sure that we settle these issues we\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cWe must imbibe that spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity, and love that would take us through this.\u201d\n\nPutting the blame on \u2018aiye\u2019 for the hazardous state of the country, Mr Adesina stated, \u201cWhen you are high-flying, the centrifugal forces will come against you, and it would only take the grace of God for you to attain.\n\n\u201cYoruba people call those forces Aiye. When Aiye is on your case, as it was against Man City, and it is against the Buhari government, you need God, and God alone.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing his point, Mr Buhari\u2019s aide added, \u201cAiye (meaning \u2018the world,\u2019 if freely translated) is the negative part of mankind. The pernicious, baleful, sly, and scheming part of humanity.

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Alkasim Abdulkadir provides rare insight into the fight against insurgency, nation building and why Nigerian youths must chase money",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: How special needs students are struggling against the Nigerian educational system",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 5\n\nBy: Olatunji Olaigbe\n\nOn the 20th of March, 2021, Jamiu Jibril, a visually impaired student sat to write his Master\u2019s entrance examination at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ilorin. He had an aid who read out the questions and wrote down his answers for him, and like the non-special needs student sitting for the exam, he was given two and half hours.\n\nThroughout Jibril\u2019s academic journey, he has had to depend on the goodwill of other students and his extra-thrust for knowledge to go through school. The University of Ilorin, the same tertiary institution he got his graduate degree from, never provided him with special needs resources.\n\nHe remembers going to the university\u2019s center for special students one day and being told \u201cthe center was for deaf students, and not the blind. Everything I did, every assistance I got, was on me,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nLike Jibril, special needs students in Nigerian tertiary institutions struggle against myriads of problems in the quest for education.\n\nIn a research by Abubakar Ahmed, Zakaria Al-Cheikh Mahmoud Awad, and Mastura Adam; Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and Kano University of Science and Technology (KUST) were scored 26.7% and 13.3% respectively in their accessibility to the mobility impaired, noting: \u201cOnly 272 special schools, homes, centers, and integrated school cater for the education of Special needs children in Nigeria; a country whose Persons living With Disability (PWD) population was put at 19 million. Only 10% of the over 19 million disabled are receiving education in Nigerian educational environment.\u201d\n\nThe 272 represents a totality of both special needs institutions, built specifically for special needs students, and seemingly \u201cinclusive\u201d institutions \u2013 meaning they provide education for non-special needs and special needs students. But how true is the statement?\n\nIn the University of Ibadan, the department of special education is a two-storey building with no ramps or supportive devices for special students other than the auditorily impaired. This makes it hard for students with other forms of disability to move around the building, getting education.\n\nTola Alli, NewsWire.\n\n\u201cMobility impaired students have to stick to the lower floors and in unavoidable cases, they have to find someone who can assist them up the stairs\u201d, says Nimi, a student of the department. \u201cEven non-disabled students have issues getting education in the University, imagine what it\u2019s like having a disability with that.\u201d\n\nThe presence of PWDs in an institution does not directly translate into true inclusivity. Most institutions lack resources and infrastructure for special needs students. For Jibril, who has visited several institutions while representing his faculty, the University of Jos is the most special needs-friendly institution he\u2019s seen, scoring 50% by his own discretion. \u201cThe University of Lagos could be scoring 80%, because they have a lot of resources and infrastructure, but they lack the motive to use these resources.\u201d\n\nA special needs-friendly institution for an auditorily impaired student can still be non-friendly to a mobility impaired, or a visually impaired student.\n\nIn the university of Benue, Akin, an auditorily-impaired student struggles in comprehending what is being taught because the university has no audio-to-sign language interpreter.\n\nAt the University of Ilorin, Victor, another auditorily impaired student of Computer Science Education faces a different shade of the same problem. The University of Ilorin provides interpreters, \u201cbut there are not enough,\u201d says Victor. Citing that this places a lot of stress on the available interpreters. He added, \u201csometimes, the available interpreter is not familiar with me or the course being taught, [and then] misinterpretations happen.\u201d For him, just as it is for every other student, getting what is being taught right is the tiny margin between a hardworking student and an intelligent one.\n\nQuoting the answers to research questions by Education Data, Research, and Evaluation Nigeria (EDOREN):\n\nThe schools have facilities that meet the needs of all learners, such as separate toilets for girls, ramps (not stairs) for learners with physical disabilities and tactile floor guide: NO\n\n\u201cTeachers have high expectations for ALL children, believe they all can learn and encourage them to complete school: NO\n\nTeachers know about the conditions that cause physical, emotional, and learning disabilities; and can help learners to get proper care: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nLearners are involved to actively participate and develop guidelines/rules in the school to improve inclusion, reduce discrimination, violence and abuse: NO\u201d.\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nIn place of the margin between literate and non-literate PWDs in Nigeria, the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) implemented a policy encouraging institutions to make 10% of their population PWDs, \u201cbut I can assure you that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria introduced the National Policy on Special Needs Education, its first document fully dedicated to the interests of people with special needs.\n\nIn 2016, it also introduced the National Policy on Inclusive Education, which aimed to provide education to everyone. Promising to \u201coffer a quality education for all while respecting diversity\u201d. The policy defined itself as \u201cabout removing barriers to learning and involving all learners who otherwise would have been excluded through marginalization and segregation.\u201d\n\nOn 17th, January 2019, President Muhammed Buhari signed the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act \u2013 even promising the conversion of existing building structures into inclusive ones.\n\nBut most of these policies are lost in transition, not being translated into actions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for more inclusivity policies, but more need for the enforcing of already existing policies. There\u2019s a need for institutions to improve on their inclusivity.\u201d says Dr. Azubike Onuora-Oguno, a Teaching Research Fellow on Human Rights Law and Society at the International Institute of Social Sciences, Netherlands. And a senior project manager of the Disability Law Advocacy Project \u2013 an Open Society Initiative of West Africa (OSIWA) project aimed to make academic curriculums in Nigerian Universities special needs friendly.\n\nThe majority of problems come from the government, but the public has a part to play too. \u201cWe all have an obligation to accommodate PWDs, but this can\u2019t happen until we understand the concept. Parents, people have to understand that PWDs are humans, meant to be acknowledged as such,\u201d says Dr. Azuibike. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s a need for deep-seated sensitization that will make us act reasonably towards PWDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need understanding, EMPATHY, not SYMPATHY,\u201d types Abiola Dada, a special needs student at the University of Ilorin.\n\nJibril is a broadcaster at Royal FM, Ilorin, and when Jibril isn\u2019t busy with work or academics, he tutors other students in his Faculty. \u201cOn most days, the university is crowded. There\u2019s the bus fight, students literally gnawing their way through the queue. What happens to me? Do I sleep in school?\u201d Asks Jibril.",

          "title": "Murder in Uyo: Who Killed Hiny Umoren?",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 15\n\nOn Friday April 29, a 26 year-old lady set out around 1PM to attend a job interview in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Having recently completed her university program despite losing both parents, she was looking for a way to support herself before being called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) program.\n\nInstead of a job interview and hope for the future however, what she would actually encounter on that day would become one of the most shocking stories to ever emerge from Nigeria.\n\nY'all my friend @HinyHumoren is in trouble and she needs our help.\n\nI'm currently in Lagos and I can't help than to put this out there.\n\nEarlier today she told me she was going for a job interview at airport road which is quite far from her house. pic.twitter.com/X1YBLUPO7d \u2014 Happiness Activist #justiceforHinyUmoren (@UmohUduak1) April 29, 2021\n\nIniobong \u201cHiny\u201d Umoren became the subject of a desperate nationwide search led by Nigerian Twitter users after her friend Umoh Uduak put out an urgent appeal. She was eventually found, but unfortunately the worst had already happened. The police would later confirm that she was found dead, having been raped, murdered and then buried in a shallow grave.\n\nIn the wake of a crowdsourced social media sleuthing campaign which uncovered his identity, a primary suspect Frank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan was also arrested.\n\nIn a manner completely uncharacteristic of Nigeria\u2019s elephant-paced justice system, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command rapidly announced that it had extracted a confession from Akpan, and even identified his motive \u2013 he was a serial rapist and serial killer acting alone. End of story and job done.\n\nNaturally, this neat explanation did not satisfy many, who felt that Akpan could not have acted alone, and that the police might be involved in some kind of a cover up to protect powerful people potentially implicated. Rumours also began swirling about Hiny\u2019s family receiving death threats, and the suspect allegedly boasting about being well-connected.\n\nBeyond the whispers however, there has been precious little to substantiate the idea that stringing up Frank Akpan alone would not represent any kind of justice for Hiny Umoren. Sources willing to speak up and provide information about this case have generally not been forthcoming.\n\nUntil now.\n\nGame Changing Information\n\nEvery telephone conversation made via a GSM telephone line has a permanent record with the mobile service provider, which by law cannot be tampered with or erased. The information captured can vary, but it always includes the following elements: the date and time the interaction was initiated; the type of interaction (voice or SMS); the length of the interaction; the number initiating the interaction; the number receiving the interaction and the location of the closest cell towers to both parties.\n\nSome networks also record the actual conversation (voice note), and depending on the type of signal band and mobile device, it is even possible to capture the exact location of both parties, accurate to within a few metres. Anyone who can get their hands on the call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s line would very quickly be able to establish whether he was in fact acting alone \u2013 which is where my source came in handy.\n\nUnderstandably, this information is meant to be impossible to access without law enforcement authorisation. With this in mind, I have taken the extra precaution of reproducing it manually via a spreadsheet, so as to protect my source by removing all possible identifying information. Over the course of several hours last week, I pored over several days worth of leaked call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s mobile provider to make sense of the situation.\n\nWhat will be presented in this story is the closest thing that exists to objective evidence that:\n\n1.) Frank Akpan is being used to take the fall for much bigger fish involved in Hiny Umoren\u2019s murder; and\n\n2.) While Frank Akpan is certainly the primary suspect and was directly involved in the murder, there are other participants in the murder still walking free, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command intentionally bungles what should be an open and shut investigation.\n\nWho is Frank Akpan?\n\nApart from a few tidbits pieced together from social media accounts about him, very little is known about Frank Akpan the primary suspect. The timeline to his arrest begins late in the afternoon on April 29, when Umoh puts out Hiny\u2019s number hoping someone will be able to track down her friend\u2019s location.\n\nThe mention of \u201cFrank Akpan\u201d as a central figure in this story begins with this tweet from Umoh which identifies the owner of the Airtel number +2348127530092 as the person who invited Hiny for the supposed interview.\n\nA quick check with Truecaller brings up the name \u201cEzekiel Akpan.\u201d Curiously, the occupation tag on this person\u2019s Truecaller profile reads \u201cPolitical.\u201d It is important to bear in mind that Truecaller fills an individual\u2019s \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018occupation\u2019 fields by pulling high quality data from several sources including Facebook profile information and analysis of the individual\u2019s Facebook friend networks \u2013 so this tiny detail will become significant later on.\n\nShortly after finding himself under instant national scrutiny following Umoh\u2019s tweet, Akpan then attempts to throw the public off the scent with the Facebook post below. In so doing, he inadvertently confirms that the telephone number in question is actually his, thereby proving that \u201cUduak Frank Akpan\u201d and \u201cEzekiel Akpan\u201d are the same person.\n\nShortly thereafter, he deactivates his Facebook profile and seemingly goes silent until the Akwa Ibom State Police Command issues a statement 3 days later, confirming his arrest and effectively pronouncing him guilty of the crime as a sole suspect.\n\nFrank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan\n\nSo far, based on the version of the story that is in official circulation, there is only Frank Akpan and the unfortunate Hiny Umoren. The police have declared him a serial rapist \u2013 and hence a single actor. Officially, the issue is over and there is nothing more to see here. It was just a horrible monster and a woman who unfortunately fell victim under the most heartbreaking circumstances.\n\nThe only counter-story so far boils down to a few unsubstantiated social media rumours that cannot stand in court, plus what would otherwise be compelling evidence from Akpan\u2019s crime scene, which unfortunately has now been contaminated and rendered all but useless for the purpose of a criminal investigation.\n\nUduak Frank Akpan specialized in luring and kidnapping job seekers, youth Corp members, students and pupils, killing them, cutting off their sensitive parts, bury them in shallow graves then exhume their bones after decaying to sell off for more rituals#JusticeForHinyUmoren pic.twitter.com/BeexbP11wf \u2014 DR.PENKING\u2122 #JusticeForHinyUmoren (@drpenking) May 7, 2021\n\nBy deliberate malfeasance or by incompetence, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has allowed key evidence from Akpan\u2019s hideout potentially pointing to a larger conspiracy, to be trampled underfoot by hundreds of curious onlookers and social media content creators. In so doing, the evidence to build a case for anything other than a standalone Frank Akpan conviction has been destroyed or rendered inadmissible.\n\nThere is however, one type of evidence that cannot be physically destroyed or tampered with in any way. This evidence has a permanent digital record which sits in cloud storage away from the incompetence or malfeasance of the Nigeria Police Force, and what it shows without a shadow of doubt is that Frank Akpan did not act alone.\n\nOrgan trafficking to feed the international donor organ black market? Ritual killings on behalf of politicians involved in occultic practices?\n\nLet\u2019s find out.\n\nLeaked Network Records: The Smoking Gun\n\nTo properly understand and contextualise the data that you are about to see below, a little explainer is in order. As mentioned earlier, the 6 categories of telephone interaction data always recorded by service providers are call date and time, originating number, receiving number, type of interaction (call or SMS), length of interaction (in seconds) and the originating/receiving cell tower.\n\nEvery cell tower on earth has a unique location code written in this format: MCC (Mobile Country Code)-MNC (Mobile Network Code)-LAC (Location Area Code)-CellID. Nigeria\u2019s mobile country code is 621, and its 4 largest network providers MTN, Glo, Airtel and 9Mobile have the respective MNCs 30, 50, 20 and 60. Using this information alongside the LAC and CellID provided in the call records below, you can pinpoint the exact cell tower closest to where the call in question was made or received.\n\nFor example, if the given MCC is 621, the MNC is 20 (Airtel), the LAC is 00784, and the CellID is 20565, you can put this information into free public access cell site locators like cell2gps.com and the result will be a cell tower site in Uyo at the junction of Ikot-Ekpene road and Ikpa Road.\n\nThis is actual cell site data from a call made by Frank Akpan at 6.50PM on April 29, 2021\n\nThat being said, it is time to examine the leaked call record data and draw our conclusions. First, here is data I extracted from what my source provided, showing the significant parts of Frank Akpan\u2019s call and SMS history on the day Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nFor ease of understanding, I ran all the numbers through Truecaller and put the names in brackets next to them\n\nAround 1.17PM on April 29, Frank Akpan placed a call to Hiny Umoren, which lasted for 124 seconds. It is fair to extrapolate that this was a call where he gave directions to her regarding where she should go for the purported interview. At 1.21PM, he then placed a call to a Blessing Godwin, which lasted 147 seconds. Was he chatting up another potential victim of the same job interview snare? It is impossible to say for now.\n\nAt 3:38PM, Hiny Umoren then placed a call to Frank Akpan lasting for 106 seconds. If you compare the cell tower data here to that of his previous phone calls, it is clear that he was already at the supposed venue waiting for her because the tower location does not change. It is safe to assume that she was calling to tell him that she had arrived for her interview. Save for a 2-second WhatsApp voice note which Hiny later managed to send to Umoh, this call was probably the last time anyone ever heard Hiny Umoren alive again.\n\nAround 6.15PM, almost 3 hours after Hiny Umoren arrived at his lair, Frank Akpan then placed a call to an unknown number. The call records clearly show +2348127530092 \u2013 Frank Akpan\u2019s known public number \u2013 making repeated contact between 6.15PM and 6.50PM with +2348122386922, an unknown number which brings up no details on Truecaller or Facebook. For reference, if a mobile number pulls up no Truecaller, Facebook or social media results whatsoever, this could either mean that it is used on a non-internet-enabled feature phone (a so-called \u2018burner\u2019 phone), or that the owner is extremely intentional about having no digital footprint linked to that number.\n\nIncidentally, this was also around the time when the Twitter hashtag #FindHinyUmoren had already led Twitter sleuths to uncover Frank Akpan\u2019s identity, leading to his amateur attempt at misdirection referenced earlier. In the middle of a clear and obvious crisis moment, why was Frank Akpan repeatedly trying to establish contact with this unknown number with no digital footprint? The answer could lie in some data I extracted from a different set of call records showing Frank Akpan\u2019s contact with this number in the days and weeks before Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nThis unknown person contacted Frank Akpan no fewer than 12 times between April 4 and April 27\n\nWas this a regular buyer or facilitator of whatever gruesome trade Frank Akpan was involved in? Was Frank calling him for help after an unexpected social media campaign suddenly exposed him and put their entire business operation at risk? Why was this the first number that Frank called immediately after raping and murdering a young woman? We do not know the answers to these questions, but there is at least one person other than Frank Akpan himself who can probably tell us.\n\nThe \u201cSenior Forestry Officer\u201d\n\nIt is April 30, 2021, and Frank Akpan has become a nationwide hate figure on social media. His involvement in Hiny Umoren\u2019s disappearance is public knowledge at this point, and time is running out for him. He needs friends and allies to protect him \u2013 and fast. His name and picture are doing the rounds on social media, and in a city like Uyo, it will not be long before someone recognises him and he finds himself subjected to Nigerian street justice.\n\nBetween 10.27Am and 10.44AM, he places 3 phone calls to a Francisca Bassey Akpan \u2013 Francisca is in Calabar when she receives the calls, and she is using a smartphone in a location with high network capacity, which means the network is able to record her location while receiving Frank\u2019s calls to within a few metres of accuracy.\n\nAt 10.55AM, Francisca calls Frank back. Only they and the mobile network know what is said during this 51-second conversation. My source balked at the idea of obtaining customer voice notes because that would simply be a bridge too far, even for the sake of solving a brutal murder. Just getting this much information to me is already breaking multiple in-house rules and NCC codes, so they understandably did not want to push their luck.\n\nAt 4.32PM on April 30, Frank then makes one of the most most interesting phone calls in this entire story. Truecaller pulls up the details of the recipient of the phone call with the number +23480*****326 \u2013 one \u201cKufre Effiong.\u201d Unlike the other people Frank has been known to associate with, Kufre Effiong appears to be from a different world. He is significantly older than Frank and as his location details show, he lives in the swanky part of town. Who is this guy?\n\nTheir conversation lasts for just 31 seconds and presumably ends with Kufre hanging up. Frank\u2019s phone rings almost immediately at 4.34PM. The caller is +234803*****19 and this conversation lasts decidedly longer than the last one \u2013 almost 4 minutes. Who is the owner of this number that has so much to talk about with someone who is probably Nigeria\u2019s most wanted man at the moment? Truecaller answers once again.\n\nKufre Effiong is an older, wealthier looking man who apparently spends his time in the upscale Ewet Estate while Frank Akpan rapes and murders young women in uncompleted buildings somewhere across town.\n\nWhat could these two possibly have in common that brings them together? Interestingly, if you compare the location data from both calls, it is clear that both men have in fact met physically at a certain 58G, Ewet Housing Estate in Uyo. Frank is probably outside the building talking to this older, wiser man on the phone and hoping to get some help from him.\n\nMore on 58G, Ewet Housing Estate later.\n\nWho exactly is Kufre Effiong? I eventually found the answer after scrolling through dozens, maybe hundreds of social media profiles with that exact name. Mr Effiong as it turns out, is something of a big fish in Niger Delta civil service circles.\n\nNow back to the address where both men met. Plot 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is home to the Uyo branch office of a medical NGO called the Center for Clinical Care and Research (CCCR Nigeria).\n\nFounded in 2010 by an all-star list of accomplished Nigerian-American doctors, CCCR carries out medical outreach programs in underserved areas of Nigeria and promotes medical best practices using a fusion of global best practices and local healthcare delivery models. Or at least it used to, because as far as it is possible to tell, its social media pages have had no activity whatsoever since 2017. A scan of news stories since 2017 using the keywords \u201cCCCR Nigeria\u201d and \u201cCenter for Clinical Care and Research Nigeria\u201d turns up nothing.\n\nAnd yet, at least if Google is to be believed, its Uyo branch office at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate still opens at 8.30AM everyday and closes at 5PM. This exact address also happens to be where Kufre Effiong made and received calls from Frank Akpan, who also physically met him there 24 hours after raping and murdering Hiny Umoren. This leaves open two possibilities.\n\nThe first is that the Uyo Branch office of an organisation which specifically offers \u201csupply chain management of health commodities\u201d may have been commandeered by an illegal organ trafficking ring to feed the booming global black market organ trade. At the lower end of the operation would be Frank Akpan who would specialise in rape and murder of defenceless women so as to harvest their organs for onward delivery to those in charge of the operation.\n\nBlack market value of human organs | Source: Gizmodo\n\nThe second possibility is more prosaic, but no less horrific. Due to the convoluted house numbering system in Uyo, the property labeled as 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is also recognised on most digital maps as Plot S.9, Unit G, Ewet Housing Estate. That address is also home to Davok Suites, which is a popular upmarket hotel in Uyo favoured by high profile guests including the Cameroon national team.\n\nThis would be the ideal location for a trusted associate of a politician \u2013 say, a senior civil servant \u2013 to lay his head while running a clandestine errand for his boss. An errand such as sourcing human parts for use in a ritual sacrifice ahead of the upcoming election season, for example. Whatever it is that happened or is happening at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate \u2013 and for whose benefit \u2013 is a question only Kufre Effiong can answer. Cavernous as this story has become, there is still one more twist.\n\nHiny Umoren\u2019s Murder \u2013 A Police Cover Up In Progress\n\nAt the outset, I referenced a press release from the Akwa Ibom State Command on May 2 patting themselves on the back for arresting Frank Akpan and solving a huge criminal conspiracy in 5 minutes by pinning everything on him. One of the names singled out for praise in the press release for his alleged role in apprehending Frank Akpan was a certain SP Samuel Ezeugo.\n\nOn April 30, at 4.40PM, Frank Akpan placed a call to someone with the number +2348034386086.\n\nSecond from bottom\n\nAt this point, I trust it will not shock you to know that when I ran this number through Truecaller, the name that came up was none other than\u2026\n\nThe one and the same.\n\nIn other words, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command is releasing statements claiming to be solving a crime by arresting a suspect, the suspect was actually making telephone calls to one of the police officers who would later \u201carrest\u201d him, and speaking to him for a minute and a half. What were they talking about? Perhaps Frank Akpan \u2013 who was still at large at the time \u2013 was giving SP Ezeugo instructions for how to apprehend him nicely?\n\nEven more conveniently, Akpan placed the call to SP Ezeugo less than a minute after receiving a text message from Kufre Effiong. While still physically located at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate.\n\nIn other words, the senior civil servant working at the Niger Delta Ministry probably sent SP Ezeugo\u2019s phone number to Akpan via SMS, with instructions to call him and let him \u201chandle\u201d it.\n\nAnd most tellingly of all, SP Ezeugo\u2019s cell tower location data indicates that while all this was happening, he was in close range of a cell tower near the entrance of Ewet Housing Estate. Presumably, on his way to meet oga.\n\nTake note of the cell tower\u2019s location next to General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nFor comparison, look at Ewet Housing Estate vis-a-vis General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nSo putting the entire picture together, we have what appears to be a well-connected criminal gang in Akwa Ibom with links to the police and the Federal Ministry of the Niger Delta, which probably specialises in sourcing human organs either for the purpose of selling to the international black market or to service local politicians who believe in ritual human sacrifice.\n\nBy the accident of targeting someone with significant social media capital, the existence of this organisation is threatened, and so the Akwa Ibom Police Command is allegedly being used to actively bungle and mishandle the case.\n\nFinding the individual who owns the telephone number +2348*******22 is central to unraveling the mystery of why Iniobong Umoren had to die, how many more like her have died in the past, and most importantly, who are the big fish behind the entire operation. Exactly what is going on at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is another key question that must be answered.\n\nIf Frank Akpan won\u2019t talk, maybe Kufre Effiong can tell us.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated in view of fresh facts.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "title": "Isa Ali Pantami \u2013 The Inside Story of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications & Digital Economy",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

          "text": "The possibility of shifting the date for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) is very high, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said.\n\nJAMB Registrar, Professor Ishaq Oloyede, explained that this was because of the inability of at least 600,000 candidates who have indicated interest to participate, to register for the examination scheduled to hold between June 5 and 19.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual meeting with 2021 UTME committee members on Friday, he disclosed that 1.1 million candidates have so far registered for the 2021 UTME, and the board anticipated approximately 1.9 million registrations at the end of the exercise.\n\nThe JAMB boss noted that while 50 per cent of the candidates have already registered without problem, there was a need to carry everyone along.\n\nHe stated that at the end of the meeting with the stakeholders, they would decide on whether to shift the exam forward or not.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of shifting the exam forward is still high, but that will be determined after our meeting with stakeholders,\u201d said Professor Oloyede.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is because about 600,000 candidates who have indicated interest in the exam are yet to register. There is a need to give everyone the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe examination body, which is responsible for the conduct of the entrance examination into the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions, had directed candidates to provide two pictures in the exam script \u2013 that of who register for the exam and of persons who register for the National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nThe NIN, which is a unique number that identifies individuals, is issued by the country\u2019s National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) upon enrolment.\n\nThe JAMB registrar apologised for the new initiatives introduced in the 2021 UTME, noting that it was not to punish candidates but to expose candidates who engage in the habit of indulging in various forms of malpractices.\n\nWhile calling on the candidates to take note of the process, Professor Oloyede clarified that the essence was to dictate any disparity in the process.\n\n\u201cWe apologise for putting you through some hardship in the registration. The government directed that anyone participating in JAMB must have their NIN. This is beyond our control. Those who are yet to register should do so.\n\n\u201cThe MOCK exam is bill to come up on Thursday. It is an exam meant to test out capability. As you all know, the main exam is coming up on June 5 and 19, 2021,\u201d he told the meeting.\n\nThe JAMB boss added, \u201cWe are meeting with stakeholders today to discuss the issues and on whether we will shift the exam date forward or not. We will brief the media on the outcome of the meeting tomorrow.\n\n\u201cShifting the exam date is not the solution; at the meeting, we will discuss how some of the problems encountered by candidates would be resolved. It is important that we carry everyone along.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that JAMB has secured about 802 exam centres across the country and 104 centres in towns.",

Fueled by anguish, desperation and distrust of the government, rumors and hoaxes are spreading by word of mouth and on social media in India, compounding the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\n\n\u201cWidespread panic has led to a plethora of misinformation,\u201d said Rahul Namboori, co-founder of Fact Crescendo, an independent fact-checking organization in India.\n\nWhile treatments such as a few drops of lemon juice in the nose may sound harmless, such claims can have deadly consequences if they lead people to skip vaccinations or ignore other guidelines.\n\nIn January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that India had \u201csaved humanity from a big disaster by containing corona effectively.\u201d Life began to resume, and so did attendance at cricket matches, religious pilgrimages and political rallies for Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist party.\n\nFour months later, cases and deaths have exploded, the country\u2019s vaccine rollout has faltered and public anger and mistrust have grown.\n\n\u201cAll of the propaganda, misinformation and conspiracy theories that I\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks has been very, very political,\u201d said Sumitra Badrinathan, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who studies misinformation in India. \u201cSome people are using it to criticize the government, while others are using it to support it.\u201d\n\nDistrust of Western vaccines and health care is also driving misinformation about sham treatments as well as claims about traditional remedies.\n\nIndia has also experienced the same types of misinformation about vaccines and vaccine side effects seen around the world.\n\nLast month, the popular Tamil actor Vivek died two days after receiving his COVID-19 vaccination. The hospital where he died said Vivek had advanced heart disease, but his death has been seized on by vaccine opponents as evidence that the government is hiding side effects.\n\nMuch of the misinformation travels on WhatsApp, which has more than 400 million users in India. Unlike more open sites like Facebook or Twitter, WhatsApp \u2014 which is owned by Facebook \u2014 is an encrypted platform that allows users to exchange messages privately.\n\nWhatsApp said in a statement that it works hard to limit misleading or dangerous content by working with public health bodies like the World Health Organization and fact-checking organizations. The platform has also added safeguards restricting the spread of chain messages and directing users to accurate online information.\n\nThe service is also making it easier for users in India and other nations to use its service to find information about vaccinations.\n\n\u201cFalse claims can discourage people from getting vaccines, seeking the doctor\u2019s help, or taking the virus seriously,\u201d Fact Crescendo\u2019s Namboori said. \u201cThe stakes have never been so high.\u201d",
