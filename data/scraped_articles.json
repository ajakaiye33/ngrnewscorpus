          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n.Urges advocates of state police to seek parliamentary nod\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nABUJA- National chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Alhaji Salihu Mustapha has warned against inciting comments capable of plunging the country into another civil war and instead seek peaceful means of resolving conflicts.\n\nThis is as Mustapha argued that only peaceful Nigeria will make possible the conduct of the 2023 general elections to birth a new government.\n\nREAD ALSO: Bayelsa opens partnership negotiations with IbomAir over commmercial flights\n\nHe disclosed this yesterday in a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the ex-deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, CPC; Nigerians regardless of their political affiliations must realize that they have no other country other than Nigeria and must therefore avoid the path that would quicken her balkanization.\n\n\u201cI condemn the attempt by some groups and persons to politicize our security challenges. As Nigerians, we should learn from the ethnic crisis in Rwanda and elsewhere. Violence has never solved any country\u2019s problems,\u201d he counselled.\n\nThe APC chieftain further called on Nigerians to reflect on Vice President Yemi Oshibajo\u2019s remarks of the evil of war when he sighted a Justice of the Supreme Court of Rwanda queuing for food ration in a refugee camp.\n\n\u201cWar or violence does not recognize religion or tribe.\n\nIt is a consuming fire. It is not respecter of any body \u2013 the poor or rich; old or young,\u201d he added.\n\nHe continued: \u201cUnfortunate as the level of insecurity may be, politicians, persons and groups should be careful not to overheat the system. We should bear in mind that no nation survives a civil war twice. Let\u2019s join hands with the present administration to find a lasting solution to the problems which predate this administration\n\n\u201cNigerians who were born after the Civil war should learn lessons from Rwanda in 1994. War is bad, war is evil. Let us be properly guided.He that rushes to war or advocates war, should know that war brings death and destruction,\u201d he further stressed.\n\nThe APC boss also enjoined fellow citizens to always canvass and preach peace and a united Nigeria, adding that \u201cthis is the time for all lovers of peace and continued existence of Nigeria to speak out.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the chairman of the National Peace Committee and former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd) alongside other elder statesmen to speak up and calm fray nerves.\n\n\u201cI am calling on the General Abdulsalami Abubakar-led peace committee to rally senior citizens to talk and foster peace. 2023 would be an illusion without peace and a united Nigeria\u201d, he stated, even as he noted that the challenges bedeviling the country today were inherited by incumbent administration.\n\n\u201cThis insecurity challenge occasioned by the Boko Haram insurgency is an inherited crisis and therefore should be tackled with all sense of responsibility by all Nigerians\u201d, he explained.\n\n\u201cWe should support our Armed Forces for the sacrifices that they are making for the nation. They are laying their lives for unity of Nigeria. Terrorism is a global affair and therefore all hands must be on deck to address it,\u201d he added.\n\nMustapha advised advocates of State Police to take advantage of the ongoing constitution amendment exercise at the National Assembly to drum support for their position.\n\n\u201cAdvocates of state police should take their advocacy to the National Assembly, especially now that there is an on going constitutional amendment committee.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a democracy and therefore Nigerians should not behave as we are in a military government. Due process must always take its due place in all we do,\u201d he maintained.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

So, we want to see how we can conclude with you and start operations.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to choose Ibom Air because those who stay near each other have the tendency of exchanging pleasantries and other good things.\n\n\u201cAnd so, we decided that instead of going to meet commercial airlines like Orleans and AirPeace and then even the New United airlines, we agreed to start with Akwa Ibom our neighbours to set the ball rolling.\n\n\u201cOur intention is to do two flights for now; a trip to and from Abuja as well as a trip to and from Lagos.

          "title": "Why I featured Bobrisky in my movie \u2013Tayo Sobola, actress",
          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nPretty actress, Tayo Sobola popularly known as Sotayo Gaga by fans and colleagues in the movie industry has opened up on reasons she had a secret wedding and why she won\u2019t reveal her husband\u2019s identity.\n\nPictures of you wearing a wedding gown went viral recently, are you truly married?\n\nYes, I am married, but the truth is that it\u2019s not recent; I just decided to post the pictures on social media.\n\nHow come you didn\u2019t reveal your husband\u2019s identity?\n\nIt\u2019s because I wanted to keep my marriage and husband private. I am the star and one who\u2019s popularly known in the movie industry, not my husband. He\u2019s a private person, so there is no point exposing him to the public.\n\nNow that you are married, what should we expect from you?\n\nWell, nothing is changing about me. It\u2019s just that I have decided to spread out a little. I just opened my clothing line, Clean Stitches, but a lot of people still don\u2019t believe I own it; some think I just modeled for the brand. Now, we have opened a new branch in Abuja.\n\nWhy Abuja, is that where marriage has taken you?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not really because of marriage. I have a home here in Lagos; I also have a house in Abuja. And I have always been traversing Lagos and Abuja, and now that it is time to expand my business tentacles, I then thought of Abuja. Aside the fact that we have our clients all over the world, Abuja people patronise us a lot. If you notice my signature, you will realise that I deal with lots of boubou, and iro and buba, which are mostly rocked by classy or funky women. And trust me, Abuja has them plenty. So, I did my research and came to the conclusion that since I have a landed property there, and my shop too, I will have good sales. So, I made up my mind to open another branch in Abuja.\n\nAre you now fully into fashion and no more acting for Sotayo?\n\nNo. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am known in the industry already, so I can always go off and on and remain as if I never left. In life, there\u2019s always time and season\u2026there were times we were after fame, now we are after money.\n\nAre you saying that movies are no longer paying your bills?\n\nNot really, but for now, I want to concentrate on my business. There are some doors that being an actress will open that money might not open. So, both acting and business are paying.\n\nOf recent, one of your colleagues came out to say that she makes millions from acting, that they pay her up to N5 million per role. Could that be true?\n\nAbsolutely yes! Why not? Some (producers) can pay you as much as N10 million to feature in a movie, whereas another producer can pay you as low as N200, 000 for the same role. It all depends on your relationship and how you can sell their movie, and how much they have on ground for the production.\n\nFrom the productions you have done in the past, did you make such money?\n\nSo, you think I will invest in a project that will not profit me? Never! Let me tell you a clear truth, I have never produced a movie without making money in return. I am a businesswoman. How can I put my money down and not make profit from it?\n\nThere was a time you featured popular cross dresser, Bobrisky, in one of your movies, what informed that decision?\n\nIf you know me well, you will know that I don\u2019t discriminate. I have known Bobrisky since he was Idris, and if you watch that movie very well, you will see that I used it to pass a message whereby his \u2018younger sister\u2019 was manhandled because of the way he was trying to attract men to himself, and at end of it all, he gave up on that particular habit.\n\nHow and where did you meet your husband?\n\nOne thing people don\u2019t know is that I have been with my husband for over seven to eight years now.\n\nSo, you have been married that long?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get me wrong. We have only been married for a couple of months.\n\nWhere did both of you meet?\n\nLet me give you that as an assignment to find out. Thank you.\n\nBetween compact disc and Netflix, which one do you think brings more profit to the industry?\n\nBoth have their advantages and disadvantages. For the elite, who hardly watch television and can easily access any movie of their choice on their smart phones, they will go for Netflix, YouTube and the rest. For the typical trader, who hardly uses smartphones, they can\u2019t ever rule out compact disc or DVD as we may call it. If I should reason as a business owner, I will go for DVD, but civilization is timeless\u2026everyday we move with new trends.\n\nWould you say your clothing line has changed your dress sense to wearing boubou, iro and buba and abaya kind of clothes?\n\nI can slay iro and buba to the White House. I am someone who likes my comfort, although my mood most times dictates my dressing. But I will choose boubou and iro and buba over any other outfits anytime.\n\nRecently, the Nigerian music industry witnessed a turnaround when Wizkid and Burna Boy won the Grammys, do you think Nollywood movies too can win Oscar?\n\nWhy not? There\u2019s nothing that can never happen. You know, the way white people think is not the way we reason. Recently, Davido featured in Hollywood film, Coming To America 2, so who knows what the next move could be.\n\nWhat do you have to say about Yoruba movies shot with low budget and English movies with high budget and their production quality?\n\nTruly speaking, that\u2019s not the yardstick to determine a low or high budget movie. I can shoot with millions of naira and still have a very bad quality production, while some shoot with hundreds of thousands and get a very good quality job. And I can spend a month on location and still not come up with something good, while some people will spend few days or weeks and come out with a good job. So, all those things don\u2019t determine a good job at all.\n\nSo, no more movie roles for Tayo; it\u2019s all about Clean Stitches now?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get it twisted; you might see me in politics anytime soon.",

          "title": "2023: Why Nigerians should shun APC, PDP \u2013 Sani, ADP chairman",
          "text": "From Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nNational Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Dr Yagbaji Sani, has said that rotational presidency, otherwise known as zoning, has not provided the needed economic development for the country, rather it has broadened the gap of division and nepotism.\n\nHe, therefore, suggested in this interview that political parties should always throw the contest open so that those with the needed administrative acumen would not be disenfranchised because of where they come from.\n\nThe former presidential candidate also joined the clamour for the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, sequel to his utterances on insurgency in the past.\n\nHe maintained that the spate of killings and kidnapping perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents is a by-products of Pantami\u2019s teachings.\n\nHe, however, backed the Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Mahmud Gumi, for facilitating negotiations with bandits and parents of kidnapped children, adding that he has not done anything wrong.\n\nHe also encouraged political leaders to judiciously utilise resources in their possession to create employment, build schools, hospitals and roads, in order to keep the youth busy. Except:\n\nWhat is your take on the spate of insecurity in the country?\n\nIf truth must be told, I believe it is the consequences of leadership failure. Because when there is leadership failure, definitely, you will see that even the most basic things that should be taken care of will not be addressed properly. Because when you look at democracy or any form of government at all, in fact, even in constitution, the two fundamental responsibilities of the government is the issue of security and the welfare of the people. That is what the constitution says. Any government that cannot provide the two things for its citizens has no moral rights to expect respect from the citizens. And if care is not taken it might even get to a revolt; the people may rebel against you because you have not been able to take care of the basic requirements. So, I believe that why what is happening is happening is because we have leadership failure. Period.\n\nWhile the PDP is pushing for a summit to discuss the way forward on insecurity, the APC is not seeing the need for such a meeting. How do we address the problem?\n\nBoth the APC and PDP are one and the same. It is six and half a dozen. That is what it is. You see, when you look at APC and you throw back your attention and recollect what happened during the PDP era, it is just a re-enactment of what happened during the PDP era only that this time around it is more endemic. There seems to be a total collapse of the situation today. We are just afraid that the whole thing will collapse under the PDP. But PDP was not better than what we are seeing under APC. Under PDP, Boko Haram insurgents were even coming to Abuja attacking people, and exploding everywhere. People were afraid just like what we have now. People were not free to move around. But the case we have today is worse; which means that the situation has been degrading from the PDP time till now. So, it is like a case of a kettle calling the pot black. There is nothing that the PDP is accusing the APC today that it did not do. There was leadership failure under the PDP too. And what we are running away is for Nigeria to run away from the situation we have found ourselves today. So, the issue is that Nigerians must start to think and look away from these two parties. Nigeria is bigger than PDP and APC because we transcend those parties. Nigeria does not start and end with APC and PDP. And, when you look at it, the same people that were in PDP in which we were having the problem are the same people today that are in APC. So, it is not as if outside these people you do not have Nigerians that can take care of this country. The situation we have in this country is that Nigerians do not want to rise to the occasion themselves. We must begin to see the futility of continuing to support these two parties in government because they do not have what Nigeria needs. And what Nigeria needs today are people who have this country at heart and have the competence and capability to deliver this 21st Century economy that we have which is a promise of greatness. There is nothing that we need in this economy to make it great that is not there. What is lacking is leadership. What is lacking is the fact that our process of the recruitment of leadership is still at that stage of people manipulating the levers of power and rigging elections to bring in people that cannot deliver. So, if you have your process of recruitment of leadership as corrupt as it is, there is no way you can dream of having people that would live up to expectations or be ready to give this country the kind of leadership that it deserves. So, this is why we are just in a vicious cycle. And both the APC and PDP, believing in me, everybody in this country knows that they are one and the same. It is the same bad dream that we had during the last administration that we are having today. Nigerians never thought that we will be where we are in this country today. Why because we have competent people. We have the resources. We have the statute as a nation which is respected across the globe. That is why anywhere you go Nigerians are respected because they know what you are worth; in terms of resources, leadership and capacity. So, when you talk about PDP or APC, believing in me, it is those that what you can call failure of our circumstances. We just found ourselves in almost a failed state. Look at what happened during Jonathan, the international community had come to rescue Nigeria. It is because Nigeria was almost failing as a nation. Today, we are in a worse situation that we need to be rescued that is why some people are saying that we should look for foreign assistance. It is because Nigeria was almost failing. The political class you have today that are in charge of the affairs of this country have failed. The truth is that they do not have what Nigeria needs so they cannot give that leadership. That is why people should look at the direction of ADP. God knows why he put parties like ours in this country today. It is to rescue this country. There is nothing we will do today that will give this country the kind of progress, peace and unity that are required under another APC or PDP government. It will never happen. Because when they come in instead of concentrating on building the nation they will just be talking about things that are not relevant. The issue is that we have come to the stage where another set of people should be allowed to run the affairs of this country. We can do it. It has been proven that things cannot change unless we the followership change. And change is an option. If it is a situation where we do not have an option that would be a different thing entirely. So, the blame game is all because we do not want to change. So, the press has a lot to do here. The press can make this country work by ensuring that it changes the narrative. It should not be about PDP and APC. Nigerians should begin to understand that there is an option or alternative that is more credible that can give this country a leadership that would provide new path to progress, prosperity, unity and pragmatic leadership that will unleash this huge potential that we have as a country. Everybody knows that we are a country that is of promise of greatness by everything that we need to have. Look at the leadership we have today that is not even engaged with the people. As bad as the situation is you should have a kind of interaction with your people. But that is not happening. Money is given out and nobody is accounting for it even for the insecurity you are talking about. Billions of naira have been given to this people, nobody is telling us what happened to those monies, how it was spent. If it was their own money, none of them would allow things like this to happen; that you spent billions and there is nothing to show for it. There is evidence of arms purchased, no money in the account and to the extent that they are even asking for more money. They want to be given more budget to fight this war as if we are people that have saw-dust in our brains. We need to break from this rigmarole and the narrative of PDP and APC. We still have two years to go. It can be done. The press can lead. Every country where meaningful change happened, it is the press that leads the way.\n\nDo you also subscribe to the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, following his utterances on insurgency?\n\nI have told you about leadership failure. Where you have leadership, government will not wait for this thing to happen whether wrong of right. The man is not denying what he said or didn\u2019t say. He did. So, the issue is that government, particularly the president, should realise the fact that he was elected by the people of this country and he swore by the Quran that he was going to protect the interest of this country; that he was going to exert fear or favour. So, when you have discovered that in one reason or the other you have a minister in your cabinet that has been accused of most of the things that are happening today in terms of insecurity, whether remotely or anyhow you want to look it, at least, to demonstrate to the nation that he is representing them and that he is living up to his responsibility, this man should be eased out because he did not deny it. Why are we having the problem we are having today? It is because of people that had, or still have those kind of mentality, and their ideology is not in tune with the modern way of doing things. He said he did, but he is recanting that he is not in that kind of belief anymore. But, we are suffering from the by-products. That is what snowballed into what we are having today. It is those people that you taught, those radical thinking that are still in the bush. Even though you have now said that you have renowned that ideology, we are still suffering from the damage in this country. Because that is why we still have the likes of Boko Haram people that are thinking differently. Yes, he has apologised. If the country wants, it can forgive him or allow the law to take its course. But, the right thing to be done is for the government to relief him of his duties and responsibilities, and then let him understand that what he did, the country is still suffering from it. In other climes, if you are in government of a high school, and they discovered that you raped a girl or smoked marijuana, you would be in trouble. There was a judge of a Supreme Court that was supposed to be appointed in America, you can see the extent they went because a woman came out and said the man took advantage of her in a high school. It became an issue. So, it is not enough to come out and apologise. He should not be allowed to continue in office in all fairness given the circumstances we are in today, and given the fact that we cannot divorce those radical ideologies we are having today. So, he is responsible.\n\nAre you comfortable with the role being played by Sheikh Gumi in negotiating with bandits?\n\nUnder this circumstance or the situation we are in, it is the right thing to do. Do you know why? The government has denied people money they are supposed to use to build hospitals, schools and roads. They come to Abuja, collect the money, sit down in a room and divide the money among themselves, thinking that the people are stupid or they do not know what is happening. If they are using the billions collected from the federation account to build schools, hospitals and good roads you would not have bandits. If some have jobs and leave their houses at 8:00a.m to go to work, would they have time to go into the bush? That is why they are taking it by force. So, under this scenario, it is right. Let them sit up. Let them stop stealing. Let them use the money to create employment and not to buy houses in Dubai or Europe and always going for vacation. They have exhausted all the civil ways of doing things, that is why they are in the bush. Gumi is right. When Buhari came to power he said 70 per cent of the budget is being stolen. But what did he do about it? And you want the people to just fold their hands and be watching you?\n\nThough we still have two years to the next general election, there has been this agitation for the Southeast to produce the next president. What is your take?\n\nI do not like to indulge in what I call a very high intelligent way of looking at issues in the country. The problem we have in this country transcends zoning. They are more serious than where the president of Nigeria should come from. Why are we where we are today? It is because of the issue of zoning. You can take it from the Jonathan\u2019s time to now. It is just because they did not allow the best material to emerge as the president of this country; it was always handpicked. It has always taken religious dimension as if when it comes to the issues of the country the person can do better. We should wake up and begin to think about this country as a serious business. If in your private business you start bringing in sentiments like employing your brothers even when they are not competent, what would happen to the business? Definitely, it will fail. For God sake, let us be serious. The position of the president requires more than what we are attributing to it. I look at it as lazy and people who are not serious in their way of thinking. In social club you can do that, but when it comes to the issue of president, we should have a checklist as a nation. We should look at track records and performances that will matter. This is doable. The leaders of thoughts are there to do it. The press is there. It can set the agenda and change the narrative. Look at where we are today. We are a laughing stock simply because there is a leadership failure and because we did not do the right thing. If zoning is working, why are people in Katsina being killed like chicken? Why is the whole North on fire? The business of running the country is a very serious business. It is not about this man is a Yoruba man, or Hausa man or an Igbo man. Let us begin to look at tract records. If you look at countries that have gone passed us like Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, most of them jettisoned the idea of where a person is coming from. Because when you do that you have completely disjointed the whole issue of running the country from what it should be to what has no relevance in the governance itself. And that is why we are always failing.\n\nWhat is the prospect of ADP in the next general election?\n\nIt is very bright. Do not mind the ballooning of membership they are telling people. Believe me, by the time the two parties will explode you will see what will happen. We believe that the ADP has a very unique opportunity in 2023 because Nigerians will wake up. And sane people who have the country at heart will look for a party like ADP to begin to build Nigeria and not themselves or tribes because that is what we represent. We are the Noah\u2019s Ark that will take the country to the Promised Land.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nDetermined in stopping bandits from infiltrating Abuja, security forces have commenced massive deployment of personnel and equipment to all entry and exit points of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThis is coming barely 24 hours after Daily Sun exclusively reported that the military high command had approved a massive deployment of special forces to fringe towns and villages where bandits are believed to be taking refuge.\n\nSunday Sun investigation revealed that security operatives have also commenced raid on major spots in Kogi, Niger and Nasarawa states just as they have commenced demolition and raids on all known criminal hideouts within and around the FCT.\n\nThe security agencies made up of a joint task force are also said to be raiding major motor parks, uncompleted buildings, markets, mechanic workshops and villages, where criminals and bandits are believed to be hiding.\n\nIt was gathered that following the alarm raised by residents of Bwari, a satellite town in the FCT, the military in conjunction with security agencies swung into action.\n\nThe military, Sunday Sun gathered, is on red alert to counter any terrorists invasion. The Forward Operation Bases (FOB) is also combing the forests within Keffi, Niger and Kogi states, where some of the terrorists were said to have set up their camps. The camps have been demolished.\n\nA security source who does not want to be mentioned told Sunday Sun that the security agencies are also clamping down on illegal drug sellers, especially the hawkers, as it has been discovered that they have direct contacts with the criminals.\n\nThe source identified Maraba, Masaka, Nyanya Motor park, Kugbo, Kubwa, Dutse, Apo, Gwagwalada, Gwagwa, Mpape, Asokoro village, Garki village, Jabi motor park, Utako market, Nyanya market, Zuba, Suleja, Abuja/Keffi road, Lugbe, Kuje, Orozo, Kado, among others as some of the identified spots in Abuja.\n\nThe Guards Brigade, which is saddled with the primary assignment of providing security for the president, his immediate family, VIPs, the FCT and the surrounding states, has deployed enough manpower and equipment to give any criminal group that may want to cause trouble heat, it was gathered.\n\nThe Army Headquarters Garrison is also said to have deployed its men, especially in plain clothes, to some of these places to checkmate activities of criminals.\n\nThe source told Sunday Sun that the military cannot afford to allow criminals, especially bandits and terrorists, into the FCT.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI can tell you that we are on red alert. We know there is tension over terrorists\u2019 invasion of the FCT after the Niger State governor raised the alarm that the terrorists would soon come here. We know they would come and we are ready for them. Already, our men are all over the place to battle these men. Abuja is the last place we will allow them to come and carry out their atrocities.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that prior to the alarm raised by the Niger State governor, over possible invasion of the FCT, bandits had taken over some FCT villages, kidnapping innocent villagers, including traditional rulers, security operatives on a regular basis and collecting ransom from their relatives.\n\nRecently, bandits invaded an orphanage home and abducted over eight orphans. The police said they were carrying out a covert operation to rescue the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, following social media reports that kidnappers had infiltrated the nation\u2019s capital, the FCT Police Commissioner, Bala Ciroma, in a statement assured that the FCT was not under attack by terrorists, urging the residents not to panic, as the police have put all security measures in place to protect lives and property.\n\nBut despite the assurances, activities of criminals have continued to thrive in the FCT.\n\nCiroma in a statement signed by the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, said: \u201cThe attention of the FCT Joint Security Team has been drawn to a viral publication in the social media purporting that the \u2018Federal Capital Territory is under the attack of Boko Haram terrorists\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Security Team of the FCT wishes to refute the mischievous publication targeted at creating palpable tension amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT. Contrary to the speculation, the Heads of Security Agencies (HOSA) in the Federal Capital Territory in the bid to address security concerns within the FCT, held a strategic meeting on Thursday 29th April, 2021, where the team resolved to deploy alternative proactive crime-fighting measures within the FCT particularly in areas with challenging terrain including aggressive motorized/foot patrols.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, more schools have shutdown in Abuja, following threats by bandits to attack and abduct students. The mass closure of schools kicked off on Wednesday. On Thursday and Friday, more schools sent their students home.\n\nGovernment schools are not left out, despite repeated assurances by the FCT administration that the schools were safe. The worst hit areas are Bwari, Kuje, Kwali and Abaji.",

The apex court then held that the tenure of the sacked council chairmen, elected in 2018 had expired, and ordered the state government to pay all salaries and allowances of the sacked chairmen from May 2019 to March 2022, apart from awarding a cost of N20million against the government as damages.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe could not be part of the preparation for that election at the initial stage because we felt the dissolution of democratically-elected chairmen and councillors was illegal. Now that we have been vindicated, it is thus right for the government to give a level playing field in order for us to test our popularity.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, the former ALGON chairman, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye, who was a former chairman of Oluyole local government, expressed appreciation to all those who contributed to the victory at the apex court. He dedicated the victory to the memory of immediate past two-term governor of the state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, who was instrumental to the victory based on the support he gave.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt, Joe Effiong, Uyo\n\nIt was a bloody Saturday, yesterday, as gunmen overran various police formations in Rivers and Akwa Ibom states, killing a total of 12 policemen and a woman.\n\nThis is further to the orgy of deadly attacks on security operatives that has continued to rip through the South East and South South regions in the recent weeks.\n\nIn Rivers State, gunmen reportedly shot dead at least seven policemen in an unexpected invasion of communities in the State. Similarly, gunmen reportedly overran another police station in Akwa Ibom, gunning down five policemen, and a woman.\n\nThe Rivers incident happened late last Friday night on the East-West Road between Choba Bridge and Rumuji community. Sunday Sun gathered that the gunmen first attacked the C4i police formation at Emohua community and killed two people. They also attacked a stop-and-search police point at Ogbakiri Junction before moving to Rumuji where they killed three policemen.\n\nIt was further learnt that the hoodlums also attacked Elimgbu Police station in Obio/Akpor LGA and killed two men in what seemed like a coordinated operation.\n\nThe youth president of Elimgbu community, Uche Morgan, told newsmen that the incident took place about 10pm on Friday night.\n\nMorgan disclosed that the moment he heard it, he mobilised his fellow youths to the station ad were there till Saturday morning.

Regrettably, a total of five assault rifles were lost in the incident.\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom attack which came barely one week after two police officers were gunned down in Ika local government area of Akwa Ibom State, saw the killing another five policemen and a woman in Ini Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe policemen and the woman said to be a wife of one of the police officers were allegedly gunned down by hoodlums at a police divisional headquarter situated at Odoro Ikpe.\n\nSunday Sun learned that the hoodlums were said to have stormed the police station in two buses in the early hours of Saturday. They also set some vehicles and the police station ablaze, injuring some other policemen who scampered for safety.\n\nConfirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Odiko MacDon (SP), who was at the scene of the attack for on-the-spot assessment, said: \u201cThere was an attack at the Divisional Police headquarters, Odoro Ikpe in Ini Local Government Area. Six persons including five officers and a wife of an officer were killed.\u201d\n\nRecall that police stations and other security posts in Akwa Ibom State have in recent months experienced cases of early-morning attack, leading to the death of officers and destruction of facilities, including utility vehicles and infrastructures.\n\nAn online statement purportedly issues by the office of the chairman, Ini Local Government Area, Mr Isreal Idaisin, alleged that the invasion was carried out by members of Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe gunmen who came in two buses and a Sienna car filled with armed men numbering more than 40, arrived Ini Local Government Area with sophisticated weapons and broke into the police facility at precisely 2:45am, killing five policemen on duty, burning vehicles while inflicting injuries on others.\n\n\u201cSome police officers who attempted to repel the gunmen were overrun.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the council boss commended the youths of the area for raising the alarm which helped to reduce the number of casualties.\n\n\u201cI urge the good people of Ini LGA to stay calm as we are working with relevant security agencies and the Government of Akwa Ibom State to ensure that the situation is contained and necessary modalities are being put in place to forestall a recurrence. There is no cause for fear as the culprits will be brought to book in no distant time,\u201d the statement read\n\nSunday Sun could not however confirm the authenticity of the statement as it was signed neither by the chairman nor any of his media aides.

          "text": "\u2022Debates frequent students\u2019 abductions, boko haram attacks\n\nBayo Akinloye\n\nWorried about the nation\u2019s unceasing insecurity, the United Kingdom\u2019s parliament, the House of Commons, has held consistent debates between April 12 and 22 over the continued abductions of students and the sustained attacks by Boko Haream\u2019s insurgents.\n\nThe lawmakers debate, THISDAY understood, centred around understanding the situation in Nigeriaand subsequently providing assistance to her government.\n\nFor example, on April 12, lawmaker Jim Shannon, the Democratic Unionist Party MP for Strangford, sought to find out what discussions the UK government had had with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration on helping to prevent the kidnap of children from schools.\n\nIn response, James Duddridge, the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, said, \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the kidnapping and continued captivity of schoolchildren by Boko Haram (BH) and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in North-East Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe British High Commission continues to raise these cases with the Nigerian government, most recently in March 2021. We are also concerned by the recent attacks on schools in Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, and Katsina states, conducted by criminal groups.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cI publicly condemned these attacks and stressed the importance of all children being able to access an education without fear. The UK Deputy National Security Advisor discussed the abduction of Nigerian schoolboys in Kankara in Katsina State with the president\u2019s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, on December 15, 2020.\n\n\u201cOur High Commissioner in Abuja spoke to the Inspector General of the Nigerian Police on improving school safety and addressing kidnapping in March 2021.\u201d\n\nDuddridge explained that the UK provided mentoring and capacity building for units of the Nigerian Police Force to improve their anti-kidnap capacity and response to organised crime groups in Nigeria.\n\nThe following week, on April 19, another UK lawmaker, Stephen Doughty, the Labour (Co-op) MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, demanded from the British government an assessment of the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East following recent attacks and the displacement of people in the Damasak area.\n\nDuddgride explained that the UK government was concerned by the security and humanitarian situation in the North-East, where terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa, continue to attack local communities.\n\nShedding more light on his assessment, he noted, \u201cRecent attacks on Damasak in Borno State, in which civilians, humanitarian workers, and facilities were targeted, have led to a worsening humanitarian situation, and the displacement of local residents and internally displaced people to Niger or other areas of north-east Nigeria. As the UK government has repeatedly made clear, humanitarian workers should never be a target.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated to the House of Commons that the UK remained \u201ccommitted to helping Nigeria tackle the threat posed by the terrorist groups\u201d in the North-East, adding, \u201cWe are providing significant humanitarian and stabilisation assistance to support affected communities, including those who have been displaced.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s findings also showed that 60 to 69 UK-based staff were posted by the then Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development and currently Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office to all posts in Nigeria as of March 31, 2021.\n\nOn April 20, another legislator Hilary Benn, the Labour MP for Leeds Central, asked specifically about the threat to Christians amid killings in Nigeria.\n\nIn response, Duddridge stated that the UK condemned all violence against civilians in Nigeria, irrespective of religion. He pointed out that in the North-East, terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISWA, \u201ccontinue to cause immense suffering to both Muslim and Christian\u201d communities.\n\n\u201cThese groups seek to undermine the right to freedom of religion or belief by indiscriminately attacking those of all faiths, who do not subscribe to their extremist views,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further told the House of Commons that intercommunal violence across multiple states also \u201chas a devastating impact\u201d on Christian and Muslim communities and disclosed that the \u201cunderlying drivers of violence are complex, and frequently relate to competition over resources and increasing criminality.\u201d\n\nOn April 26 and 27 April, the UK minister disclosed that he met with \u201ca range of Nigerian interlocutors, including governors\u201d from some northern states and Nigerian government representatives, including the foreign affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama.\n\n\u201cI raised the need for all communities to be protected amidst increasing insecurity\u2026We will continue to encourage the Nigerian government to take urgent action to protect all communities and to implement long-term solutions that address the root causes of violence,\u201d he told the parliament.\n\nThe UK envoy also told the House of Commons about the issues of LGBT in Nigeria, noting that the UK government is worried about the criminalisation of homosexuality, recognising that there is a long way to go before all LGBT people can live free and equal lives in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking of the country and others in Africa, Duddridge explained, \u201cWe make regular representations to governments around the world on this issue, including in Uganda, Ghana, Namibia and Nigeria. We work through our Embassies and High Commissions, as well as international organisations, including the UN, Council of Europe, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Commonwealth, to promote non-discrimination towards LGBT people, and to address discriminatory laws.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe directly challenge governments that criminalise homosexuality at the highest political levels.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, el-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating E-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his State several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Eyes N30 billion in second quarter\n\nObinna Chima\n\nDespite the decline in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) last year due mainly to the effects of COVID-19, Ogun State Government raked in N21 billion in the first quarter of this year. Governor Dapo Abiodun disclosed this in a statement on Friday, saying the state has perfected plans to generate over N100 billion in 2021.\n\nAbiodun spoke at a special Iftar (breaking of fast) with members of the House of Representatives, House of Assembly, State Executive Council, and the Body of Permanent Secretaries. He stressed that his administration was committed to putting the state on a strong financial and economic footing through creative governance.\n\nThe governor said the dip in the state\u2019s IGR in 2020 was due to drop in earnings from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE), tax incentives given to industries in the state, and lack of revenue from the education sector.\n\nHe said the target for the second quarter of 2021 was N30 billion.\n\nAbiodun stated, \u201cOur IGR dipped in 2020 and there are some reasons for that \u2013 there was no Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for us during the COVID-19 period, we gave incentives to industries because they couldn\u2019t work during that period, and because we are the education capital of the country, a lot of our IGR was coming from the tertiary institutions and because there were no students in schools, the revenue did not come in.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what the good news is, the good news is that first quarter of 2021, we already got N21 billion.\n\n\u201cLast year, we did N58 billion, so we\u2019ve already gotten half of what we got last year in one quarter. This present quarter, we will do at least N30 billion, and by the end of this year, by the grace of God, we will do over N100 billion in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration discovered that Land Use Charge was not being paid in the state, stressing that it inherited a database of 14,000 people from the previous administration. He said the discovery led his administration to put in place mechanisms, which had helped the state to realise a database of Land Use Charge for over 1.5 million people. \u201cThis will translate into a lot for our administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nAbiodun stated that his administration would soon launch Ogun State Land Administration and Management System (OLAS) to help residents of the state who had built on government property to come and regularise their papers.\n\n\u201cThat system using ICT, we are going to ensure that all those that have built, we are starting with government owned property alone, all those that have built on government property will have to come and regularise their papers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are not talking about those that built on any other land, we are talking of government land alone, so we bring them in to regularise their papers.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the state of the nation and the intended reversal of the new minimum wage by some states, the governor said his administration, being one of the first to sign the minimum wage into law, was committed to the continuous payment of the new wage to its workforce.\n\nHe stated, \u201cNot only did we implement it, my colleagues are now reversing the minimum wage because they can\u2019t pay it. Some of my colleagues have even asked me if I am sure I can keep on paying the minimum wage, I told them that Ogun State is not like other states, that in Ogun State, we have to keep on paying the wage.\n\n\u201cSo, I am committing to the very excellent public service that I have that I will continue to pay the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nAbiodun urged members of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), to democratically put their best candidates forward at the forthcoming local government elections in the state. He assured that everything would be done in consonance with the principles of democracy.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the deputy governor, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, commended the governor for his quality leadership, saying this is behind the giant strides of his administration in the last two years.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Any changes to the US dollar\u2019s status are likely to emerge in the long run, the survey noted.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had on April 27, 2018, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria signed a Currency Swap Agreement with the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) on behalf of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe swap deal, an agreement with a three-year tenor, allows both the CBN and PBoC to swap a maximum amount of 15 billion Renminbi/Chinese Yuan (CNY 15 billion) for N720 billion.\n\nThis amount is equivalent to $2.5 billion using the prevailing exchange rate of N305:$1 at the time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Suspended Nigeria Ports Authority Manager, Hadiza Bala, was involved in a clandestine ploy to shortchange a company in favour of Africa\u2019s richest, Aliko Dangote, documents obtained by SaharaReporters have revealed.\n\nLast year, some coastline terminals, formerly operated by Integrated Logistics Services\u2019 (INTELs) in Onne ports complex, Rivers State, were confiscated and subsequently awarded to Dangote through a proxy company, International Container Terminal Services (ICTS) Nigeria limited.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nOnne Port Complex is one of the largest Oil and Gas Free Zone in Africa, where major industry players from the exploration up to the completion phases operate.\n\nThe complex has two major terminals: the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) and Federal Lighter Terminal (FLT).\n\nFor over a decade, INTELs Nigeria, partly owned by former Vice president, Atiku Abubakar, operated some berths at the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) of the complex, providing logistics services until 2020.\n\nThe three berths of FOT numbered 9, 10 and were taken over by the NPA in a controversial manner, which many thought was a move by President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration move to witch-hunt Abubakar, his opponent in the 2019 election and break the company\u2019s monopoly.\n\nThe NPA, in September 2020, issued a notice announcing that the service operation handled by the Integrated Logistics Services (Intels) Nigeria had been terminated.\n\nIt further states that all Service Boats Owners and Operators are to do transactions directly in each of the Port Complex of the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, a memo released to the press, seen by SaharaReporters, showed that Usman had transferred the berths confiscated from INTELs to ICTSI, a proxy company traced to Dangote, five months earlier.\n\nThe leaked memo, dated May 13, was signed by Yusuf Ahmed, NPA\u2019s Director of Lands & Asset Admin, on behalf of Usman.\n\n\u201cPlease refer to the lease of land and berths 9, 10 and 11 granted to you at FOT Onne and find attached herewith the draft Lease Agreement for a review of its possible contents before the final copy is produced for execution,\u201d the letter addressed to the managing director of ICTSI read. See Also Sahara Reporters EXPOSED: How NPA Director, Hadiza Usman, Was Removed Over Dubious Lebanese Contract Involving Lawan, Amaechi, Malami\n\nAhmed urged the company to send their comments for consideration.\n\n\u201cA registered surveyor will be appointed to produce the survey plan of the property to incorporation in the Lease Agreement and you will be required to see the surveyors fees,\u201d it further read.\n\nThis was not Usman\u2019s first time dealing with Dangote as money transfers between the duo dates back to 2015.\n\nA Nigerian newspaper, Peoples Gazette, had previously reported how Dangote transferred N200 million to a bank account run by Usman during the build-up of the 2015 general election.\n\nThe transactions were sent in two tranches from two different bank accounts of Africa\u2019s richest man to Ms Bala Usman\u2019s account with Access Bank, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cMs. Bala Usman received the first N100 million transfer on February 6, 2015, while the second N100 million came through three days later on February 9. The transfers carried ambiguous descriptions that made it difficult to conclude their purpose.\u201d\n\nMs Bala was recently instructed to step aside for an independent investigation into a series of allegations of impropriety.\n\nNigeria\u2019s transport minister, Rotimi Amaechi, also alleged that the yearly remittance of operating surpluses by the regulatory body from 2016 to 2020 was short of the amount due for actual remittance \u2014 a claim, which according to him, should be investigated.\n\nOn Thursday, no reason was given for the suspension of Usman, who was reappointed for another five-year tenure recently.\n\nShe was first appointed as the Managing Director of NPA in 2016.\n\nAccording to a release by President\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, President Buhari approved the recommendation of the Ministry of Transportation for the setting up of an Administrative Panel of Inquiry to investigate the Management of NPA.\n\n\u201cThe President has also approved that the Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, to step aside while the investigation is carried out. Mr Mohammed Koko will act in that position.

          "text": "Suspended Nigeria Ports Authority Manager, Hadiza Bala, was involved in a clandestine ploy to shortchange a company in favour of Africa\u2019s richest, Aliko Dangote, documents obtained by SaharaReporters have revealed.\n\nLast year, some coastline terminals, formerly operated by Integrated Logistics Services\u2019 (INTELs) in Onne ports complex, Rivers State, were confiscated and subsequently awarded to Dangote through a proxy company, International Container Terminal Services (ICTS) Nigeria limited.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nOnne Port Complex is one of the largest Oil and Gas Free Zone in Africa, where major industry players from the exploration up to the completion phases operate.\n\nThe complex has two major terminals: the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) and Federal Lighter Terminal (FLT).\n\nFor over a decade, INTELs Nigeria, partly owned by former Vice president, Atiku Abubakar, operated some berths at the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) of the complex, providing logistics services until 2020.\n\nThe three berths of FOT numbered 9, 10 and were taken over by the NPA in a controversial manner, which many thought was a move by President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration move to witch-hunt Abubakar, his opponent in the 2019 election and break the company\u2019s monopoly.\n\nThe NPA, in September 2020, issued a notice announcing that the service operation handled by the Integrated Logistics Services (Intels) Nigeria had been terminated.\n\nIt further states that all Service Boats Owners and Operators are to do transactions directly in each of the Port Complex of the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, a memo released to the press, seen by SaharaReporters, showed that Usman had transferred the berths confiscated from INTELs to ICTSI, a proxy company traced to Dangote, five months earlier.\n\nThe leaked memo, dated May 13, was signed by Yusuf Ahmed, NPA\u2019s Director of Lands & Asset Admin, on behalf of Usman.\n\n\u201cPlease refer to the lease of land and berths 9, 10 and 11 granted to you at FOT Onne and find attached herewith the draft Lease Agreement for a review of its possible contents before the final copy is produced for execution,\u201d the letter addressed to the managing director of ICTSI read. See Also Sahara Reporters EXPOSED: How NPA Director, Hadiza Usman, Was Removed Over Dubious Lebanese Contract Involving Lawan, Amaechi, Malami\n\nAhmed urged the company to send their comments for consideration.\n\n\u201cA registered surveyor will be appointed to produce the survey plan of the property to incorporation in the Lease Agreement and you will be required to see the surveyors fees,\u201d it further read.\n\nThis was not Usman\u2019s first time dealing with Dangote as money transfers between the duo dates back to 2015.\n\nA Nigerian newspaper, Peoples Gazette, had previously reported how Dangote transferred N200 million to a bank account run by Usman during the build-up of the 2015 general election.\n\nThe transactions were sent in two tranches from two different bank accounts of Africa\u2019s richest man to Ms Bala Usman\u2019s account with Access Bank, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cMs. Bala Usman received the first N100 million transfer on February 6, 2015, while the second N100 million came through three days later on February 9. The transfers carried ambiguous descriptions that made it difficult to conclude their purpose.\u201d\n\nMs Bala was recently instructed to step aside for an independent investigation into a series of allegations of impropriety.\n\nNigeria\u2019s transport minister, Rotimi Amaechi, also alleged that the yearly remittance of operating surpluses by the regulatory body from 2016 to 2020 was short of the amount due for actual remittance \u2014 a claim, which according to him, should be investigated.\n\nOn Thursday, no reason was given for the suspension of Usman, who was reappointed for another five-year tenure recently.\n\nShe was first appointed as the Managing Director of NPA in 2016.\n\nAccording to a release by President\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, President Buhari approved the recommendation of the Ministry of Transportation for the setting up of an Administrative Panel of Inquiry to investigate the Management of NPA.\n\n\u201cThe President has also approved that the Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, to step aside while the investigation is carried out. Mr Mohammed Koko will act in that position. The panel is to be headed by the Director, Maritime Services of the Ministry, while the Deputy Director, Legal of the same ministry, will serve as Secretary. The Minister will appoint other panel members,\u201d Shehu had said in the release.\n\nWhile details of some of the other allegations against Usman remain unclear, sources said acts of favouritism were part.",

The investigating officer has stated numerous times to my legal team that I, Kiernan Jarryd Forbes, have not been named to be a suspect, but have been nothing by a cooperating witness. What I will say as my truth is I was and still am madly in love with a girl, carrying whatever past traumas she faced before I met her,\u201d it read.\n\nHe revealed that he had also submitted himself for psychological and spiritual counselling for his own benefit as he strives to overcome the trauma.\n\n\u201cI own up to my past and current traumas and I have submitted myself to psychological and spiritual counselling for my own benefit and growth,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI hope everyone affected by Anele\u2019s traumatic passing does the same for themselves, individually and collectively, so that we may all afford her spirit the rest she deserves and come to terms with the choices she made that fateful morning of 11 April.\u201d\n\nAKA said it is unfortunate that people he and his late fianc\u00e9e trusted with their challenges have started using such to smear his reputation.\n\n\u201cIt is a sad day when I find myself having to speak to the nature of my relationship with Anele. What makes it even sadder is the knowledge that some of the people she and I loved and entrusted with our deepest troubles are now using those as weapons to set a negative narrative on my character,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cI am a passionate and emotional person. What I will not do and stand for is watching people attempt to disparage my name and, importantly, Anele\u2019s character to suit a narrative we both ever signed up for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe enjoyed a beautiful, yet challenging relationship that at times was tumultuous, like all relationships. Made worse by the pressures of being in the public eye, which we too played up to.\n\n\u201cAs numb as I was at Anele\u2019s funeral, I took in every word imparted, the direct ones and all those filled innuendos. I will not be a part of speaking or exposing our troubles as a couple to defend myself from one-sided views that are portrayed out of their full context.

The unfortunate situation with the current reality is that the political class, especially the executive, is totally insensitive to the Nigerian people, almost offensively intolerant of what Nigerians think,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, if you wanted Pantami to go, the thing to tell the government is \u201cPantami should stay\u201d and they will do the exact opposite, because they have total disregard for the Nigerian people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I have no judgment, personally, as to whether or not Pantami should go. The thing is the whole democratic order has failed us. What Nigeria needs is to restore a sense of belief in democracy by doing something really dramatic.\n\n\u201cRight now, the legitimacy of this regime is gone.

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions.

CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different.

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email busines [email protected]\n\nWhat has gender, age, cultural background and lifestyle choices like Viking style beard, dreadlocks, and living in one\u2019s heads got to do with creativity and building great products?\n\nThe answer is not farfetched, and you will be surprised at who has the answer to this entangling query. It is an ageing millennial, proud video gamer, gym bunny, nature lover and talented techie \u2013 David!\n\nEven though he plies his trade at Sterling Bank, David (not real name) loves his Viking style beard, the sartorial nonconformity that his role permits, which ensures he fits in with his informal clique\u2019s trademark looks.\n\nDavid takes himself quite seriously. And he cannot live with dressing up for work like it is Harvard Commencement. His focus is being purposeful than abiding by insular codes. More than often, he gets shunned for having an alternative view of work, religion, and culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost every one of us knows what it means and feels like to be excluded. David had a more intense and recurring experience. His alternative views were never really accommodated, and he never felt welcomed, valued, respected, and heard until he accidentally found Sterling Bank.\n\nHis plug was a dreadlocked videographer at a Decagon Institute event that works for the Bank. His gadgets, not the dreadlock was the catch \u2013 they were best-in-class. It turned out to be work tools provided for the young creative to excel in his art.\n\nHe later encountered the executive leading the Strategy and Innovation Group at the same event. A youthful female! Also, the hip and cool gang at the event were identified as the Talent Acquisition team from Sterling. They are working with Decagon to fund the training of tech talents to move them up the employability and socio-economic ladders.\n\nDavid was excited. This must be the tribe he had always longed for. As they say, the rest is history, and he is now part of the Bank\u2019s diverse team from across the entire spectrum of society doing meaningful work. Months after joining Sterling, he is still fascinated by the level of inclusiveness.\n\nHe is working with more female tech talents for the first time. They are heavy lifters, with one of them emerging as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for the meaningful work done at Sterling.\n\nNothing gives David more joy than the Grow with Sterling initiative for secondary school leavers. It empowers them to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in disciplines that include Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Digital Transformation at Nexford University. The Bank pays 85% of their school fees, bringing their contribution towards their tuition for a bachelor\u2019s degree from an American University to less than $500.\n\nThe reason for his joy? Before joining Sterling Bank, David had a brilliant colleague who worked for another organization and even though he offers groundbreaking ideas and, with huge potential, he was limited by not having a polytechnic or university degree. Team members rarely listen or pay attention to him because of his age and education level. A loss for all involved.\n\nBelieving that it is his duty and obligation to change that, David shares his diversity and inclusion Sterling love story with his network. Letting them know that it is the drawing well for innovation, and the pipeline for new-to-the-world products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nGet your story featured on Techpoint.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nWhat has gender, age, cultural background and lifestyle choices like Viking style beard, dreadlocks, and living in one\u2019s heads got to do with creativity and building great products?\n\nThe answer is not farfetched, and you will be surprised at who has the answer to this entangling query. It is an ageing millennial, proud video gamer, gym bunny, nature lover and talented techie \u2013 David!\n\nEven though he plies his trade at Sterling Bank, David (not real name) loves his Viking style beard, the sartorial nonconformity that his role permits, which ensures he fits in with his informal clique\u2019s trademark looks.\n\nDavid takes himself quite seriously. And he cannot live with dressing up for work like it is Harvard Commencement. His focus is being purposeful than abiding by insular codes. More than often, he gets shunned for having an alternative view of work, religion, and culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost every one of us knows what it means and feels like to be excluded. David had a more intense and recurring experience. His alternative views were never really accommodated, and he never felt welcomed, valued, respected, and heard until he accidentally found Sterling Bank.\n\nHis plug was a dreadlocked videographer at a Decagon Institute event that works for the Bank. His gadgets, not the dreadlock was the catch \u2013 they were best-in-class. It turned out to be work tools provided for the young creative to excel in his art.\n\nHe later encountered the executive leading the Strategy and Innovation Group at the same event. A youthful female! Also, the hip and cool gang at the event were identified as the Talent Acquisition team from Sterling. They are working with Decagon to fund the training of tech talents to move them up the employability and socio-economic ladders.\n\nDavid was excited. This must be the tribe he had always longed for. As they say, the rest is history, and he is now part of the Bank\u2019s diverse team from across the entire spectrum of society doing meaningful work. Months after joining Sterling, he is still fascinated by the level of inclusiveness.\n\nHe is working with more female tech talents for the first time. They are heavy lifters, with one of them emerging as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for the meaningful work done at Sterling.\n\nNothing gives David more joy than the Grow with Sterling initiative for secondary school leavers. It empowers them to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in disciplines that include Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Digital Transformation at Nexford University. The Bank pays 85% of their school fees, bringing their contribution towards their tuition for a bachelor\u2019s degree from an American University to less than $500.\n\nThe reason for his joy? Before joining Sterling Bank, David had a brilliant colleague who worked for another organization and even though he offers groundbreaking ideas and, with huge potential, he was limited by not having a polytechnic or university degree. Team members rarely listen or pay attention to him because of his age and education level. A loss for all involved.\n\nBelieving that it is his duty and obligation to change that, David shares his diversity and inclusion Sterling love story with his network. Letting them know that it is the drawing well for innovation, and the pipeline for new-to-the-world products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nGet your story featured on Techpoint.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state.

          "title": "There\u2019s scarcity of male teachers in Enugu \u2013 Survey",
          "text": "Professionals in the education sector in Enugu State have bemoaned the very low number of male teachers in schools across the state.\n\nMost of them identified poor remuneration of teachers as the major factor driving the gender imbalance in the teaching profession in the state.\n\nThe professionals made their views known in a survey conducted by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu State.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education, in March, organised a zonal stakeholder\u2019s meeting in Enugu State to revise the 14-year-old National Policy on Gender in Education.\n\nAmong others, the zero draft of the policy listed the lack of male teacher models as one of the emerging issues hampering the successful implementation of the policy in the South-east.\n\nAccording to open data on the website of the Federal Ministry of Education, Enugu State has 10,415 teachers in public primary schools as at the 2015/2016 session.\n\nOf this number, 8,340 were females and 2,075 were males, representing a gender ratio of 80:20.\n\nFurthermore, at the senior secondary school level, the total number of female teachers in public and private schools was 20,552, compared to the 6,512 for males.\n\nThis represents a gender spread of 76 per cent to a paltry 24 per cent female-to-male gender ratio, according to analysis by NAN.\n\nOnly one male teacher in four schools!\n\nSpeaking with NAN, the Head Mistress of Ekulu Nursery and Primary School \u2013 4, Enugu State, Chinwe Ifeyinwa, revealed that Ekulu\u2019s four autonomous schools had only one male teacher.\n\nMrs Ifeyinwa blamed this deficit on the \u201cpoor pay packet\u201d of teachers.\n\n\u201cThe lack of male teachers also has an effect on the physical education of students. For example, in organising sports such as football.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of the male teachers to teach them these things. However, some of the female teachers have learned how to coach the boys,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to the Vice-Principal (Academics), Government Secondary School, Enugu, Donald Ndubuisi, male teachers play important roles in enforcing discipline in schools.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for a balance in the proportion of male to female teachers in schools.\n\n\u201cIn some of the big schools where students exhibit some forms of juvenile exuberances, you will discover that male teachers are not there.\n\n\u201cThis means that the government would have to employ security agencies such as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps to help keep the school safe.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, male teachers would have helped to bridge this gap,\u201d Mr Ndubuisi noted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn her contribution, the Principal of Urban Girls Secondary School, Enugu, Jacinta Ebue, described the shortage as a current and future problem.\n\nMs Ebue said the all-female secondary school has 83 female teachers, while the male teachers are nine only.\n\nShe also said most male teachers appeared not to be fully committed to the profession because they were on the lookout for another job or an additional source of income.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is giving the younger ones the idea that the profession is gender-based. They start thinking that the teaching profession, especially at this level, is meant for females,\u201d Ms Ebue added.\n\nMore female teachers even in all-male school!\n\nEven in all-male school like the Union Secondary School in Akwunanaw, Enugu, there are more than 50 female teachers, while the male teachers are only five.\n\nThe Vice-Principal (Administration) of the school, Ijeoma Jideofor, said men were discouraged from the teaching profession because of the many financial responsibilities they faced.\n\nIn his contribution, Ikechukwu Nvene, a Biology teacher at the school, admitted that most male teachers were in the profession because they could not get better alternatives.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is here with us, even now. Most of us are here in the schools because we could not get what we wanted elsewhere.\n\n\u201cAnd when you are here because you don\u2019t have any other place to go, you cannot give your best as there would be no passion for the job.\n\n\u201cMost people are not here because they want to teach,\u201d Mr Nvene asserted.\n\nHowever, while most of the school administrators see this gender imbalance as a problem, the Principal of Prime Rose School, one of Enugu\u2019s elite private schools, Ubaka Onwuegbuna, differs.\n\n\u201cFor the education of the male child, I don\u2019t think the shortage of male teachers has any negative impact.\n\n\u201cThis is because the few teachers can also serve as models if they have positive values and work hard. The male students can imitate and look up to them as role models,\u201d Mrs Onwuegbuna said.\n\n\u2018Most women have \u2018long legs\u2019 to get the jobs\u2019\n\nCalistus Nwankwo, a teacher with over 25 years of experience, believed other factors also contributed to the gender imbalance.\n\nMr Nwankwo, who taught Economics at Urban Girls Secondary School, noted that some men who were interested in the profession could not get in.\n\n\u201cApart from remuneration, there is the issue of godfatherism. Some men are interested in teaching, but they don\u2019t have somebody to put them there.\n\n\u201cFor example, during the N-Power recruitment exercise, I know somebody that scored a high grade but could not get in because he did not have anybody to push him through.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not that males totally hate the teaching profession. Some don\u2019t just have people to fight for them. Most women have \u2018long legs\u2019 to get the jobs, compared to the males,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of the male teachers who spoke with NAN observed that their passion for the teaching profession was what kept them going despite the odds.\n\nFor Levi Orjinweke, a teacher of over 15 years and French tutor at Urban Girls Secondary School, his love for the subject he is teaching has made him enjoy the job.\n\n\u201cIt is the passion I have for the subject I teach, not just any other thing. The language I teach is a very important language to me because I love it. I need to stay in form. If you don\u2019t teach it, you forget it,\u201d Mr Orjinweke said.\n\nHe said \u201cboth genders are needed to produce balanced youths.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Mr Nwankwo said the loss of the prestige associated with the teaching profession was also a problem.\n\n\u201cYou find it difficult to behave like others, especially financially. Also, people no longer respect the intellect of the teachers. Rather, everybody respects worldly things like money,\u201d he noted.\n\nMr Nwankwo said another challenge was the arrogance and showing-off by female teachers who have wealthy husbands.\n\n\u201cThe way they show off will tell you that you are in danger. If you are not a full man, you may begin to find another way out, especially when you are not called to the profession,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Nwankwo however, said such a situation should spur the male teachers to maximize their performance by doing more to help their students achieve excellence.\n\nWay forward\n\nIn order to address the deficit, the educationists who spoke with NAN called on the government to increase the salaries and other financial allowances of teachers.\n\nMr Ndubuisi called on the government to grant automatic employment to male graduates who studied education in tertiary institutions.\n\nMr Ebue on his part called on male professionals to place less emphasis on materialism.\n\nMs Jideofor called on the government to restore the glory in the teaching profession.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the government gave senior civil servants car loans which they deducted in installments from their salaries.\n\n\u201cThey also used to provide teachers and their families with accommodation. These days, there are no car loans, no incentives, no staff quarters.\n\n\u201cYou see teachers struggling to survive (everywhere),\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThese teachers need to make ends meet. They have their own children in schools and want to train them properly,\u201d Mr Ebue added, in his contribution.\n\n(NAN)",

This is also an opportunity to reward them for their loyalty to the bank.\n\nAccording to Ede the promo is also a way of encouraging savings in a bid towards promoting financial inclusion, as statistics show that a lot of Nigerians are still largely underbanked.\n\n\u201cOur key objective is to encourage our customers to save regularly. We are here to support them and encourage them to save and ultimately grow as well, because we are aware that they are invaluable to all that we do,\u201d Ede explained.\n\nA representative of the National Regulatory Commission, Peace Ibadie, who witnessed the draws, congratulated the 10 winners and commended the bank for its efforts at rewarding loyal customers, especially in the tough economic and business environment.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to all the winners, I am glad to be a part of this; UBA is always transparent in their promos and we can fully attest to this. It is important that the bank is also actively encouraging the savings culture.

Savings account holders eligible for this draw include Target, Bumper, Next Gen, Savings, Teens & Kiddies.\n\nApart from the savings promo which is held every three months, the bank also has the UBA Bumper Promo which is held monthly, where the first three winning customers are rewarded with N2m, Rent for a year at N1.2m and N500,000 respectively; with 20 others winning N100,000 each as consolation prizes.",

          "text": "In this interview with CHIKA IZUORA, the managing director of Amicable Mondiale Farms, Chukwudum Amaka Daniel, avers that while Nigeria is the largest producer of soya beans in Africa, the country lacks infrastructure to support export potentials.\n\nDo we have local capacity in soya beans production?\n\nYes, Nigeria is the largest producer of soybean in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), followed by South Africa. And with good Agronomic Practices (GAPs), one can harvest between 2 .5 to 4 tons from a hectare.\n\nDo we have export potentials for soya bean?\n\nCertainly, yes. Worldwide consumption of soyabean is nearly 11 million tons.\n\nAfrica consumes about 618,000 tons annually, and uses another 4,800 tons for animal feed. Nigeria is the largest consumer of soybeans in Sub-Sahara Africa followed by Uganda.\n\nSo, the local demand of soyabeans is still very high. It is actually scarce at the moment.\n\nCan it support Nigeria\u2019s diversification initiative?\n\nDefinitely. Over 1.2 million tons of soyabeans is harvested in Africa annually.\n\nDepending on the variety, soybeans can be harvested between 100 and 150 days after planting.\n\nIn Nigeria, we can turn one per cent of our idle farmland to soybean farming, and we will be happy with the diversification. Soyabean oil is another aspect of this sector that is underexplored.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nALSO READ: https://leadership.ng/poultry-association-calls-for-urgent-importation-of-animal-feeds/\n\nDoes it have job generation prospects?\n\nThe rapid growth of both the poultry and food processing industries in the past decade has increased the demand for soybean in Nigeria. It is believed that cultivation and production will increase as more farmers become aware of the potential of the crop, not only for cash/food but also for soil fertility improvement and strict control.\n\nThe market for soybean in Nigeria is growing very fast with opportunities for improving the income of farmers.\n\nWhat are the major challenges facing farmers in this space?\n\nThe major challenge in this space is the labour cost. Labour requirement in Nigeria is high since most cultivations and harvesting are done manually, but it\u2019s worth the investment.\n\nWhat level of intervention do you advocate for soya bean farmers?\n\nSoya bean farmers will be glad to have processing plants built for us to trench our crops after harvesting the pods. This is where the real labour is.\n\nHow much money do you consider appropriate to develop the soya beans sector?\n\nThere is no amount of money invested in Soyabeans farming that is a waste, just like coconut and palmoil farming.\n\nMy sincere advice is that you seek the service of an experienced expatriate to help you with the initial set up and management to avoid stories that touch the heart.\n\nSo how lucrative is farming?\n\nFarming is a lucrative business that requires patience and experience.\n\nDo not waste your money on sugar coated promises of quick money venture. Use the little land you have and invest in agriculture, especially, soyabeans, coconut and other cash crops and you will smile to the bank.",

          "title": "Bears To Maintain Dominance On Stock Market",
          "text": "BY OLUSHOLA BELLO, Lagos\n\nThe bears will maintain leadership on the Nigerian stock market this week as investors remain on the lookout for new stop rates, especially for 364-day bills.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital Limited said: \u201cwith the first quarter (Q1), 2021 earnings season now out of the way, we believe a \u2018choppy theme\u2019 will be the order of the day as investors keep their gaze on yield movements in the fixed income (FI) market.\n\n\u201cThe bears will likely maintain dominance as the absence of positive triggers will limit buying interest from the bulls. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.\u201d\n\nThis week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expected the stock market to trade sideways as investors remain on the lookout for new stop rates, especially for 364-day bills. Hence, bargain hunters can seize the opportunity to position in dividend paying stocks, particularly those that offer above 10 per cent dividend yield.\n\nALSO READ: https://leadership.ng/bearish-week-awaits-stock-market-investors/\n\nAlso, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr Ambrose Omordion said: \u201cwe expect the mixed trend to continue on profit taking and portfolio adjustment on the strength of the numbers released recently amidst the rising infection rate of the novel coronavirus cases across the globe and the high yields in the fixed income market.\n\n\u201cWe also expect economic data like the 2021Q1 GDP report, April Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index and inflation among others to reveal the state of the economy and give direction. The banking sector remains attractive on the back of the prevailing low prices, despite the Q1 mixed numbers.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the market has moved out of its trading range, saying that the market may discount the prospects of high cap companies and some blue chip stocks, ahead of their earnings reports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe, however, added that, the pullbacks offer bargain hunters and income investors fresh opportunities to reposition in high dividend yields and undervalued stocks, while looking out for quarterly numbers that would support recovery, saying that this is based on the fact that the rising fixed income yields may not be enough to scare all investors away from the equity market.\n\n\u201cAgain, the way to go is to target dividend-paying stocks and fundamentally sound companies with growth prospects in 2021, looking the way of mispriced equities. This is especially given the rising oil prices that have so far supported the economy and equity market, despite the seeming improvement in the fixed income yield which had remained at negative real rate of return due to the subsisting high inflation,\u201d Omordion said.\n\nHe explained further that \u201cthe current undervalued state of the market offers investors opportunities to position for the short, medium and long-term, which is why investors should target fundamentally sound, and dividend-paying stocks for possible capital appreciation in the new year.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the just concluded week, the market shed 1.60 per cent on high capitalised stock. Market sentiment was negative as investors booked profit following the recent rise in share prices amid relatively positive corporates Q1 2021 financial results.\n\nBearish sentiments dominated the local bourse last week, as the bears took full advantage of the gains over the last two weeks in booking profit on bellwether stocks. Save for the last trading day of the week; the local bourse recorded losses in all of the week\u2019s four trading sessions.\n\nAccordingly, the All-Share Index shed 635.67 points or 1.60 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to close at 39,198.75 points. Similarly, market capitalisation fell N416 billion to close at N20.431 trillion.\n\nThe overall bearish performance was driven by profit-taking activities in bellwether stocks, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Dangote Cement, Stanbic IBTC Holdings and Lafarge Africa.\n\nBreakdown across sub-sectors tracked showed that three out of the five indices closed in green zone; the NSE Oil/Gas index led the gainers by 5.98 per cent to 285.19 points buoyed by buying pressure on SEPLAT Petroleum Development Company (SEPLAT) shares. Similarly, the NSE Banking and the NSE Consumer Goods indices rose by 0.62 per cent each to 354.25 and 561.80 points, respectively. On the flip side, the NSE Insurance and the NSE Industrial indices fell by 2.20 per cent and 1.60 per cent to 197.06 points and 1,916.55 points.\n\nMarket breadth for the week was negative as 31 equities appreciated in price, 37 equities depreciated in price, while 92 equities remained unchanged. Royal Exchange led the gainers table by 22.64 per cent to close at 65 kobo, per share. Sovereign Trust Insurance followed with a gain of 17.39 per cent to close at 27 kobo, while Access Bank went up by 11.64 per cent to close to N8.15, per share.\n\nOn the other side, Linkage Assurance led the decliners table by 18.82 per cent to close at 69 kobo, per share. Courteville Business Solutions followed with a loss of 13.04 per cent to close at 20 kobo and NEM Insurance declined by 10.84 per cent to close at N181, per share.\n\nThe market opened for four trading days this week as the Federal Government of Nigeria declared Monday May 3, 2020 a public holiday to mark the Workers Day Anniversary. Meanwhile, a total turnover of 1.419 billion shares worth N15.918 billion in 18,459 deals were traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange, in contrast to a total of 1.441 billion shares valued at N10.883 billion that exchanged hands previous week in 19,614 deals.\n\nThe Financial Services Industry, measured by volume led the activity chart with 1.069 billion shares valued at N9.531 billion traded in 10,907 deals; contributing 75.34 per cent and 59.88 p cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively. The Industrial Goods Industry followed with 60.762 million shares worth N2.005 billion in 1,070 deals, while the Consumer Goods Industry traded a turnover of 57.023 million shares worth N1.029 billion in 2,831 deals.\n\nTrading in the top three equities; Access Bank, FBN Holdings (FBNH) and Zenith Bank, measured by volume accounted for 609.988 million shares worth N6.593 billion in 4,870 deals, contributing 43.00 per cent and 41.42 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively.\n\nOn Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) platform, a total of 30,004 units valued at N1.704 million were traded last week in 11 deals compared with a total of 60,447 units valued at N1.069 million transacted previous week in 20 deals, while on the Bonds market, a total of 19,573 units valued at N21.027 million were traded last week in eight deals compared with a total of 44,354 units valued at N46.342 million transacted previous week in 19 deals.",

          "title": "\u2026Of Middle Belt And North Central People\u2019s Forum",
          "text": "BY Golu Timothy\n\nOf recent, concerted political efforts are being built around the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and the North Central People\u2019s Forum (NCPF), all in a bid to up the antennae of political equilibrium and power distribution among the minority tribes of the north. While the MBF consists of strong minority voices across 13 of the 19 northern states plus the FCT, the NCPF is designed to accommodate political interests across 6 states plus the FCT. Both groups are fervently desirous of advancing, defending and protecting the political interests of their people and their communities. While the MBF has been on ground for years and has penetrated the cranies of most of the 13 states , the NCPF is a new creation that has taken the polity by surprise.\n\nIt is a new platform that seeks to coordinate development, stability, security and welfare of the north central geopolitical zone of the country. It is very clear that things are changing across human society and because of the dynamic nature of society and humanity, they will continue to change to meet contemporary necessities and fill in the gap thereby creating natural movements. This fits into the adage that says,\u201d the only permanent thing in life is change itself\u201d.\n\nALSO READ: https://leadership.ng/ncpf-demands-establishment-of-development-commission/\n\nA new socio-political structure has come up in the North Central zone of the nation known as the North Central Peoples Forum, NCPF. The purpose, according to its proponents, is to have a structure to negotiate the distribution of political power for the zone and possibly have in place the North Central Develpoment Commission to coordinate the physical and infrastructural development of the zone. It will be like the Niger Delta Development Commission and the newly created North East Development Commission.\n\nThe existing Middle Belt Forum, MBF is an organization formed by like-mind minority political personalities within majority of the northern states to advance the cause of their people in running the political affairs of their areas.\n\nConcerned statesmen all came together to bring the minority tribes from the north west, north east and north central together to pursue political power and its even distribution. It became a very strong tool for mass mobilization, aggregation, articulation, advocacy, education, sensitization and coordination during the first republic in which many sons and daughters of the minority tribes were elected into federal and regional parliaments. The minority tribes from states such as Plateau, Benue, Adamawa, Gombe, Kogi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Niger, Borno, Yobe, Kebbi, Bauchi, Taraba, and the Federal Capital Territory regardless of religion and ethnic backgrounds were all together in the fight for socio-political emancipation represented by the middle belt struggle.\n\nNow with the growing democratic norm of constitutionalism and due process, the efficacy of the middle belt forum is dissolving into a new political platform and structure for the justification of action and process. Interestingly most of those who believed in the middle belt struggle are now the new proponents of the new idea whose time they say, has come to fill in the gap to move the zone forward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe MBF was heavily built on good sentiments of minority marginalization and negligence and therefore its fame went even beyond its immediate environment to have attracted the solidarity of other similar activist bodies like the Afenifere, South-South Peoples Assembly, Ohaneze Ndigbo ,etc. However, this piece is not to, in anyway, undermine the Middle Belt Forum which has done quite excellently in projecting and defending the interest of the disadvantaged northern minority tribes.\n\nAdvocates of this new platform argue that their aim is to advance the cause of the zone by using the platform to unite and offer all the six states and the FCT the opportunity to present a united front for every political and economic endeavor using the legal instrument.\n\nThis is to achieve the goals of peace, stability, rapid industrialization and the exposition of the abundant potentials of the zone in areas of mining, agriculture, infrastructure, power sharing, youth and gender empowerment and safeguarding the territorial integrity of the zone.\n\nJust the way the NDDC and the NEDC were pursued and subsequently put in place as instruments for the development of the South South and North East geopolitical zones, the NCPF aimed at creating the North Central Development Commission, NCDC, but basically to have an umbrella recognized by law. Even though the NDDC and NEDC were created without any geopolitical struggles , the NCPF has taken this approach because of its socio-political disadvantage of not enjoying the support of those at the helm of affairs of the nation, which has principally been players from the core North and Southern parts of the country.\n\nBecause the North Central geopolitical zone has never produced any democratic leadership in the country, it has not been given its rightful place in the political space of Nigeria. For instance, the zone has never produced an elected President, Vice President, CBN Governor, SGF, Petroleum or some strategic Ministerial positions, etc which other zones have produced to their advantage\n\nAs it is, the constitutional provision that sub- divided the country into six geopolitical zones and recognized the North Central for administrative convenience is the perfect pillar on which the Peoples Forums stands. Its proponents believed that the middle belt forum lacks constitutional recognition and legal backing, hence its limitation in leading discussions at critical levels of governance to bring desired results. This has also widened the gap of the cold war between the north central minorities, most of whom are Christians and the core north population, majority of whom are Muslims.\n\nIt has been very difficult to reach a melting point because of the existing political suspicion. While the Muslim brethren see the middle belt forum as Christian dominated structure, the Christians view it as the only umbrella point of convergence of the northern minority tribes to pursue political power and get its share from the dominance of the core north. There s therefore the urgent need to balance the two for the progress of the zone.\n\nThe political reality in Nigeria today, calls for strong regional unity. Those from the North Central geopolitical zone of Nigeria are all minorities irrespective of religious, ethnic or political affiliations who have been suffering deliberate marginalization from the core north and the Southern parts of the country. And the only way out is to come together under a legal umbrella to fight for their rights. This must be done under a non partisan framework and whichever party that is dominant in power at any time within the zone must embrace this for the sake of its people and the development of the area. We are the least in population and therefore our voices must be one.",

Now that the Federal Government appears ready to fight corruption in the agencies, the Customs should be visited.\n\n\u201cConcerning the seizure and disposal of contraband goods, Ali has not rendered any returns in the past six years. The amount estimated from these runs into trillions of naira. He has also not made any public auction according to the Auction Sales Code.\n\n\u201cThe CG has not audited his accounts in the past six years. If he says he has done that, let him publish the audited report. Let him also publish what he has made on the auction of seized goods since he resumed. That should be subject to a forensic audit. He has never told us what he made from overtime cargoes and containers.\u2019\u2019\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Falana has called on the National Assembly to impeach President Muhammadu Buhari, saying his administration has \u201coutlived its usefulness\u201d following the deteriorating insecurity across Nigeria.\n\nMr Falana who spoke on the sidelines of an event to mark world Press Freedom Day, said Nigeria was at war, as the current administration can no longer secure lives and properties .\n\nEmphasizing that the country is afflicted by security challenges such as banditry and mass abductions currently raging across northern parts of the country and the South-West as well as incessant attacks on security agencies by unknown gunmen in South-East and South-South. He explained that the Boko Haram insurgents have taken over the North-East.\n\n\u201cOur country is going through war. In the North-East the Boko Haram sect is having an upper hand, don\u2019t be deceived,\u201d Mr Falana said, noting that the insurgents are now in Niger and Kebbi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you know what is going on in the South-East, no policeman or soldier can wear his uniform- it\u2019s as bad. I\u2019m sure you know what is going on in the South-West, kidnapping, ritual murders all over the place. So, nowhere is safe in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nBarely two weeks ago, it was reported that Boko Haram had taken over communities in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State, imposing VAT and income taxes on residents.\n\nThe state governor, Sani Bello, also announced the deportation of many residents by insurgents around Munya and Shiroro local government areas, stating that over 3,000 people have been expelled by Boko Haram.\n\nCiting the section 143 of the constitution which provides that \u201cThe President or Vice-President may be removed from office in accordance with the provisions of this section,\u201d Mr Falana berated the current administration saying that \u201ca regime that has outlived its usefulness boasts that no one can suggest that the president should resign.\n\n\u201cFor them, it\u2019s a reasonable statement to ask the president to resign. But for me I submit by virtue of section 143 and we didn\u2019t put it. If the president is unable to perform the primary functions of his office, the National Assembly shall move for him and ensure that he is neatly taken away out power through the process of impeachment,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Nigeria has obtained that stage because the government has failed in its primary duties.\n\n\u201cI think Nigeria has gotten to that stage because section 14 (2) (3) provides that the primary purpose of the government in Nigeria shall be the security and welfare of the people, so if the government can neither guarantee your security nor your welfare, what is left for that government to be sacked,\u201d said the lawyer who once claimed that Buhari\u2019s regime knows those that are breaching the peace of the country.\n\nA recent report published by BudgIT, a civic-tech non-profit organisation, indicated that Mr Buhari has spent at least N10 trillion in his unsuccessful campaign against Boko Haram insurgency and banditry.\n\nAmid Mr Buhari\u2019s unruly spending spree, federal agencies have also been accused of using \u201csecurity votes\u201d to clean out the public treasury.\n\nThe good governance body called for an investigation of Mr Buhari\u2019s unaccounted enormous military spendings since he assumed office in 2015.\n\nIt disclosed that N1.9 trillion was allocated for the security sector in the 2021 budget, a 14 per cent increase from N1.78 trillion allocated in 2020.\n\nDespite the increase in the funds allocated and Mr Buhari\u2019s promises to break down insurgents, the country continues to experience daily killings and kidnaps at the hands of Boko Haram, bandits, and killer herdsmen.",

          "text": "Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom on Saturday described Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna as a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him.\n\nOrtom added that the Kaduna governor was one of the \u201cvery few persons\u201d who misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOrtom stated this while reacting to the statement credited to El-Rufai, where the latter reportedly accused the Benue Governor of attacking the federal government to cover for his failure to secure Benue state.\n\nHowever, a statement signed by Ortom\u2019s spokesman, Terver Akase, said El-Rufai made such a comment to get back into the good books of the president.\n\nThe statement added that El-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to make such a comment owing to the insecurity and other challenges in Kaduna.\n\nPlease read Ortom\u2019s full statement on El-Rufai below:\n\nEL-RUFAI IS ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE MISLED PRESIDENT BUHARI\n\nWe read the statement credited to Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai in which he accused Governor Samuel Ortom of using the insecurity in his state to attack the Federal Government in order to cover up what he termed as the Benue State Governor\u2019s failure.\n\nWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\nA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launchpad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to the limelight.\n\nNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\nIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\n\nEl-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\nKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less that 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\nTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\nNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari. El-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\n\nNasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a Governor who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015?\n\nThe Kaduna Governor should know that only two days ago, the people of Benue State met at a stakeholders meeting in Makurdi and unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Ortom in recognition of his performance. That meeting was attended across party lines with leaders of All Progressives Congress, APC also present.",

Up till now, it has not been easy. If the case has been concluded we will try and see if we can put a closure to that chapter and we will just mourn her till maybe when I and my wife will die.\n\n\u201cBut the case is still on. I don\u2019t even know when the next hearing will be. My wife is so disturbed because of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you have an open wound that is not healing. If the case is concluded, our minds will be at rest,\u201d he said at an event organised by the Kogi State Government and unveiling of a cinema movie project in Tolulope\u2019s honour.\n\nMr Arotile stressed that if only justice can be served as soon as possible, their minds will be put to rest.\n\n\u201cTo show that you cannot just kill a serving officer, a pilot in the Air Force Base premises and the case is being treated as nobody.\n\n\u201cYou know our normal judicial service system, the case keeps dragging on\u2026that is a problem for us,\u201d Mr Arotile lamented.\n\nThe NAF had earlier in July 2020 released its preliminary report on the death of Tolulope in a car accident at their base in Kaduna.\n\nThe Force in the report revealed that Ms Arotile was killed by her friend who mistakenly hit her with his vehicle.\n\n\u201cUpon recognising their schoolmate, Arotile, after passing her, Mr Adejoh, who was driving, reversed the vehicle, ostensibly in an attempt to quickly meet up with the deceased, who was walking in the opposite direction. In the process, the vehicle struck Flying Officer Arotile from the rear, knocking her down with significant force and causing her to hit her head on the pavement. The vehicle then ran over parts of her body as it veered off the road beyond the kerb and onto the pavement, causing her further injuries,\u201d air force spokesperson, Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement containing the report.\n\nThe air force after the release of the preliminary investigation handed over the suspects Nehemiah Adejoh, Igbekele Folorunsho, and Festus Gbayegun to the at the NAF Base Kaduna.\n\nThe news of Arotile\u2019s death in July 2020 shook the nation, leaving many saddened by her demise at a prime age.\n\nThe NAF later immortalised Arotile in September by naming a Pilot\u2019s Crew Room after her.",

          "text": "The death toll in a horrific bombing at a girls\u2019 school in the Afghan capital has soared to 50, many of them pupils between 11 and 15 years old, the Interior Ministry said Sunday.\n\nThe number of wounded in Saturday\u2019s attack has also climbed to more than 100, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian.\n\nThree explosions outside the school entrance struck as students were leaving for the day, he said. The blasts occurred in a mostly Shiite neighborhood in the west of the capital. The Taliban denied responsibility, condemning the attack.\n\nThe first explosion came from a vehicle packed with explosives, followed by two others, said Arian, adding that the casualty figures could still rise.\n\nIn the capital rattled by relentless bombings, Saturday\u2019s attack was among the worst. Criticism has mounted over lack of security and growing fears of even more violence as the U.S. and NATO complete their final military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack targeted Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic Hazaras who dominate the western Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood, where the bombings occurred. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims\n\nThe area has been hit by violence against minority Shiites and most often claimed by the Islamic State affiliate operating in the country. No one has yet claimed Saturday\u2019s bombings.\n\nThe radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan\u2019s Shiites. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nSoon after the bombing, angry crowds attacked ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He had implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.\n\nBloodied backpacks and schools books lay strewn outside the Syed Al-Shahda school. In the morning, boys attend classes in the sprawling school compound and in the afternoon, it\u2019s girls\u2019 turn.\n\nResidents in the area said the explosion was deafening. Naser Rahimi told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, and immediately thought that the sheer power of the blasts meant the death toll would almost certainly climb.\n\nOne of the students fleeing the school recalled the attack, the girls\u2019 screams of the girls, the blood.\n\n\u201cI was with my classmate, we were leaving the school, when suddenly an explosion happened, \u201c said 15-year-old Zahra, whose arm had been broken by a piece of shrapnel.\n\n\u201cTen minutes later there was another explosion and just a couple of minutes later another explosion,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was yelling and there was blood everywhere, and I couldn\u2019t see anything clearly.\u201d Her friend died.\n\nOutside the Muhammad Ali Jinnah Hospital, in the Dasht-e-Barchi neighborhood dozens of people lined up to donate blood, while family members checked casualty posted lists on the walls.\n\nMost of the dozens of injured brought to the EMERGENCY Hospital for war wounded in the Afghan capital, \u201calmost all girls and young women between 12 and 20 years old,\u201d said Marco Puntin, the hospital\u2019s programme coordinator in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a statement following the attack, the EMERGENCY Hospital said the first three months of this year has seen a 21 per cent increase in war-wounded.\n\nIS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.\n\nEven as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.\n\nEarlier the group took responsibility for the targeted killing of three women media personnel in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.\n\nThe top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some \u201cbad possible outcomes\u201d against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.",

Israeli police said at least one officer was hurt.\n\nIsraeli security forces on horseback and in riot gear deployed stun grenades and water cannon against Palestinian youth who threw stones, lit fires and tore down police barricades in the streets leading to the walled Old City gates.\n\nTensions have mounted in the city, the occupied West Bank and Gaza throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, amid growing anger about the potential eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem homes on land claimed by Jewish settlers.\n\nIsraeli border guards have, during the past few days, used skunk water, tear gas, rubber-coated bullets and shock grenades to disperse sit-ins held in support of the families facing eviction in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood.\n\nAt least 205 Palestinians and 18 Israeli officers were injured in Friday\u2019s confrontations, which drew international condemnations and calls for calm.\n\nThe four members of the Middle East Quartet \u2013 the US, Russia, the EU and the UN \u2013 have expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the violence in Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cWe are alarmed by the provocative statements made by some political groups, as well as the launching of rockets and the resumption of incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel, and attacks on Palestinian farmland in the West Bank,\u201d the envoys said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Envoys noted with serious concern the possible evictions of Palestinian families from homes they have lived in for generations\u2026 and voice opposition to unilateral actions, which will only escalate the already tense environment.\n\n\u201cWe call upon Israeli authorities to exercise restraint and to avoid measures that would further escalate the situation during this period of Muslim Holy Days.\u201d\n\nMedics reported that at least 64 Palestinians have now been wounded in the latest clashes with Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem \u2013 mostly by rubber bullets, stun grenades or beatings.\n\nThe wounded includes minors and a one-year-old, and 11 people were taken to hospital, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nIsraeli police said at least one officer was hurt.\n\nIsraeli police detain a Palestinian during clashes at Damascus Gate on Laylat al-Qadr during the holy month of Ramadan, in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City [Ronen Zvulun/Reuters]\n\nAn estimated 90,000 people gathered for nighttime Laylat al-Qadr prayers at Al-Aqsa, the third-holiest site in Islam.\n\nLaylat al-Qadr or the \u201cNight of Destiny,\u201d are the most sacred prayers.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent has said 53 Palestinians have been injured in clashes with Israeli police in East Jerusalem on Saturday night.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Harry Fawcett, reporting from Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem, said there had been a \u201crepeated cycle of clashes and calm\u201d in the area between Palestinian protesters throwing plastic bottles and Israeli security forces deploying stun grenades and foul-smelling skunk water.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen some running scuffles, with people being dragged to the ground and beaten [by police] \u2013 not being arrested, but sent on their way.\u201d\n\nMohammed el-Kurd, a Palestinian resident of Sheikh Jarrah, has shared footage of Israeli police violently dispersing a sit-in by Palestinian protesters in the neighbourhood.\n\nIn one video, a group of policemen is seen destroying tents and pushing people away from the protest site. Another clip showed an officer violently dragging a Palestinian woman along the road.\n\nAn emergency Arab League meeting scheduled for Monday is unlikely to produce any change in Israel\u2019s behaviour unless Arab states, notably those that have normalised relations with Israel, decide to take meaningful action, said Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera\u2019s senior political analyst.\n\n\u201cUnless the Arab League does take some serious initiative, including putting some of those states that normalise relations with Israel on notice, unless some of those Arab countries use their leverage, whether it\u2019s diplomatic or other, with Israel, I think we will see simply more statements,\u201d Bishara said.\n\n\u201cStatements that are perhaps loud in denunciations and condemnation, but very short or low on actionable leverage in terms of forcing Israel, or its allies, not only the United States, to act in order to stop the repressions of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\u201d\n\nIsraeli police have used rubber-coated bullets and skunk water to disperse protesters in Jerusalem\u2019s Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, an Al Jazeera correspondent said.\n\nHundreds of protesters are currently gathered in the vicinity of Othman Ben Afan street, where Palestinian families threatened with evictions live, the correspondent added.",

          "text": "The disturbing security situation in Nigeria appears to have turned two governors against each other as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom have thrown caution to the wind, attacking each other over the security situation in the country.\n\nNasir El-Rufai fired the first salvo, ostensibly in support of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he claimed Governor Ortom only uses the insecurity in his state to attack the Buhari-led administration as a way to cover up for his own failure.\n\nBut an obviously agitated Ortom immediately fired back and came down heavily on his Kaduna State counterpart, accusing him of not only misleading President Buhari to gain favours, but also one of the real enemies of the country.\n\nEl-Rufai, who first hit at Ortom while responding to a video, which featured Ortom addressing protesters after some killings in Benue State, during a webinar organised by the Africa Leadership Group, claimed he no longer took his Benue colleague seriously.\n\n\u201cI did not hear what Governor Ortom said (in the video) but I know him and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to distract attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai, however, admitted that there was a fundamental problem with the capacity of the Armed Forces and the police.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have a serious national problem. I wouldn\u2019t say we are totally helpless but we are in a situation, where the Armed Forces and the Police have lost significant confidence in themselves and their institutions.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said the security agents needed more weapons and that there was a need to increase the manpower of the agencies.\n\nBut, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Terver Akase, the Benue governor said El-Rufai was instead a failure in many respects, even as his state remained one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, El-Rufai had failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna State and had no moral justification to accuse another governor.\n\nThe statement stated: \u201cA governor, who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another governor on any issue whatsoever. A governor, who chose a Muslim deputy in a state, where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that, El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Ortom was merely a ploy to make him look good before the Presidency. \u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nIt further questioned El-Rufai thus: \u201cHow has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man, who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nBerating El-Rufai for saying unprintable things during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s era, Ortom said, \u201cHe insulted the then president and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State, where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\u201d\n\nOrtom also disclosed that El-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna, adding that since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. The Benue State governor stated, \u201cThis is why he wants men of good conscience, like Governor Ortom, to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed. Kidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\n\u201cAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less than 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers, who are always identified as el-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\n\u201cTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man, who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot, who hates anyone, who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country, who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades. Nasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a governor, who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015.\u201d\n\nOrtom warned el-Rufai that Benue State would not repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, no matter the amount of blackmail, hatred and threats against the state.\n\n\u201cWe advise the Kaduna State governor to focus on addressing the numerous problems he has created in his state and leave Governor Ortom to lead Benue in peace,\u201d the statement said.\n\nTHISDAY checks confirmed that Governor Ortom is owing workers in his state several months salary arrears. However checks also revealed that farmers in the state face security challenges each time the venture out to their farms.",
