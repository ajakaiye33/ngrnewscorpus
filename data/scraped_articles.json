          "text": "The House of Representatives has said the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, did not oppose the recent resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum after its meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital.\n\nChairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Benjamin Kalu, noted that the House, under Gbajabiamila\u2019s leadership, had always been an advocate of reviewing the 1999 Constitution.\n\nKalu had reacted to the condemnations that had followed the report by a section of the media in which the Speaker reportedly attacked the governors.\n\nA statement issued by the House\u2019 spokesman on Friday was titled \u2018The Speaker Did Not Say He Is Opposed To The Southern Governors\u2019 Calls For Restructuring.\u2019\n\nThe statement partly read, \u2018The attention of the House has been drawn to several publications on online and traditional media, claiming that the Speaker, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, is opposed to the southern governors\u2019 call for restructuring. The House gathers that this allegation was attributed to statements made by the Speaker at a recent interview seeking his opinion on the issue. The House states clearly and unequivocally that the publications are false and misleading.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, below is an accurate reproduction of the statements made by the Speaker at that interview:\n\n\u201cThis is not a time for name-calling or blaming one person or the other. If truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame and whatever challenges we have, we all must come together. In the same way we all have equal shares, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve whatever issues there are. Like I said earlier, the greatest nations have gone through challenges worse than this and I believe that it is that spirit of oneness and that spirit of togetherness and unity and love that will take us through this.\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes there are many things that people have said here and there and you never know where these things are coming from. Sometimes God even puts you through challenges so that you can come out of it stronger, bigger, better, bolder. That\u2019s what I believe is gonna happen to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all put together in this one geographical space for a reason. It wasn\u2019t by happenstance or coincidence or by chance. It was ordained by Almighty God and He doesn\u2019t make mistakes, He doesn\u2019t go wrong. What He decrees is what will be and I believe He put us all together. No matter your religion, no matter your ethnicity, talking about over 250 ethnic groups in one country, it is that diversity that God had foreseen that I believe we should tap into as Nigerians. I have belief in the Nigerian resilience and in the Nigerian spirit; and in the spirit of Ramadan, we must continue to pray.\u201d\u201d\n\nKalu pointed out that nothing in the comments made by Gbajabiamila opposes the governors\u2019 call for restructuring.\n\n\u201cIndeed, from the beginning of the 9th Assembly, the House under the leadership of Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has reiterated its commitment to a thorough review of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as can be seen by the composition and activities of the Constitutional Review Committee of the House,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe statement further read, \u201cThe media is hereby cautioned to be mindful of peddling false news in the bid to misinform the general public. This is misleading and detrimental to our democracy as a nation. Like the Speaker rightly said, this is not a time to apportion blames rather this is a time for us to come together and deliberate on issues that have birthed the problem we are facing as a nation and to find a suitable solution to it.\n\n\u201cThe House urges Nigerians to disregard this news and continue to pray for a peaceful Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026exonerate Speaker Gbajabiamila\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives have descended on the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan for opposing the call of the southern governors for restructuring and true federalism.\n\nThey said that Lawan through his utterances has shown biases, technically killing the constitutional review committee.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Senate President had while granting an interview to State House Correspondents on Thursday after observing the Eid prayers alongside President Muhammadu Buhari and the Speaker of the House of Representatives at the Presidential Villa, Abuja vented his opposition to the restructuring call.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Saturday Vanguard on the matter, some members of the House however exonerated Gbajabiamila from the opposition.\n\nThe lawmakers included Hon. Sergius Ogun, representing Esan North East/ South East Federal Constituency of Edo State; Hon. Kingsley Chinda, representing Obio/Akpor Federal Constituency of Rivers State and Hon. Bede Eke, representing Abor Mbaise and Ngor Okpala federal constituency of Imo State.\n\nThe parliamentarians insisted on restructuring, saying it was long overdue in Nigeria.\n\nPresident of the senate has technically killed the constitution review committee- Hon. Sergius Ogun\n\n\u201cThe Honourable speaker, HOR, is not opposed to the southern governor\u2019s call for restructuring. If he is let him go to Lagos and say it. The senate president says the state governors should go and restructure their states, my governor the Edo state governor Mr Godwin Obaseki is restructuring our state and he doesn\u2019t need the permission of the president of the country or that of the senate to do that.\n\n\u201cThat is why some of us are asking for devolution of power, how will the man from Yobe know what\u2019s happening in Edo or Bayelsa? It\u2019s better for the man that has the mandate of the people to be given the resources to deliver the dividends of democracy to the mandate givers.\n\n\u201cThe president of the senate who\u2019s the chairman of the National Assembly has technically killed the constitution review committee as he showed his bias through his verbal deluge.\n\nGbajabiamila supports restructuring-Hon. Kingsley Chinda\n\n\u201cYou cannot continue to do the same thing the same way and expect a different result. Perhaps, they will also tell Nigerians that they are satisfied with the state of the country.\n\n\u201cAs public office holders, we tend to forget that there is life after office and that Nigeria is bigger and more important than any individual or group of citizens.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cI am aware that the Speaker has taken positions in the past Assemblies that support both fiscal and administrative restructuring like State Police and review of revenue sharing formula.\n\n\u201cHe has an inalienable right to shift position but with respect, I disagree with our Presiding Officers and I support an urgent restructuring for a more efficient public service in Nigeria.\n\nI stand by the position of the southern Govs forum-Hon. Eke\n\n\u201cI stand by the position of the southern Govs forum. It was one meeting where they stood by the pulse of those who elected them.\n\n\u201cTime has come for the truth to be told at all times. Grazing is a private business just like the trader that owns a shop in Onitsha, Idumota Ogbomosho or Diobu and therefore, herders can do well to buy land from state governments or individuals to build ranches for their business.\n\n\u201cThe country is gradually sliding into food insecurity which is even more dangerous than the bullets from herdsmen, bandits, kidnappers and other criminals. As long as farmers are not allowed to have access to their farms for fear of being attacked, raped and killed, there is no way food is going to be available to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGo to the markets in Abuja and other parts o the country, you will understand what l am talking about. Food insecurity has set in. How does a family of five or six feed on four cups of garri at N550,00?\n\n\u201cI have been an advocate of National dialogue and is excited that the Southern Governors saw it as not only necessary to solve the country\u2019s nagging challenges but a way of calming the nerves of secessionist agitators.\n\n\u201cEvery Nigerian irrespective of tribe and religion has a right to have a say in the affairs of this country which belongs to all of us\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\n\u2026Says only restructuring can keep Nigeria in peace\n\nBy James Ogunnaike, ABEOKUTA\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on Friday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to bury the idea of holding elections before restructuring the country.\n\nThe Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, who made the call at the group\u2019s meeting held at his Ogbo residence in Odogbolu local government area of Ogun State, said: \u201cthere must be a country before elections are held\u201d.\n\nAdebanjo said: \u201cWe urge Buhari to bury the idea of holding an election before returning to federalism by restructuring the country.\n\n\u201cThere must be a country before elections are held, it would be patriotic of him to heed this advice. If Gen. Buhari is sincere about keeping the country together, he must restructure the country now this is the only answer to halt the disintegration of the country. To save Nigeria, restructure the country now.\n\n\u201cWe should be proud as inheritors of a noble heritage, the party (Afenifere) was founded on the political philosophy of federalism due to the multi-ethnic, multilingual, multicultural and multi-religious nature of our country\u201d.\n\n\u201cFailure to adhere to this principle has been the cause of the instability that has plagued our country since Independence.\n\nOur consistent advocacy for the restructuring of the country to federalism is based on the founding philosophy of the party\u201d.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that the founding leader of the party is known as the father of federalism in Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is the only political system that can keep the country together in peace. It is mischievous for President Buhari\u2019s government to accuse advocates of restructuring as secessionist and separatists\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is the system that our founding fathers, The Saudarna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmad Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe agreed to before the British government granted us independence in 1960, after the collapse of Macpherson constitution in 1953\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe present constitution which is the cause of instability in the country is imposed on us by the military-dominated by Northern Muslims after the coup of 1966\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe clamour for the return of the country to federalism is born out of the obnoxious provision in the constitution which has made economic and political progress impossible and this has been the main cause of instability in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur resolve for the restructuring of the country back to federalism is unshakeable. We assert we are no secessionist. It is those who oppose restructuring that are enemies of a United Nigeria. That all opponents of restructuring give impetus to secessionists\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe in the National Assembly which is a product of this fraudulent constitution to amend the constitution, it is immoral and illogical for a product of fraud to amend the fraud.\n\nSix years ago, I warned the nation of the danger of voting for Gen. Muhammad Buhari, I accused him of being a feudalist by birth, a dictator by training and a religious fanatic\u201d.\n\n\u201cI accused him of being a tribalist who has no respect for the rule of law. We were bombarded with the propaganda that he will ruthlessly fight corruption which they said was the bane of Jonathan administration\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey even told us that as a military man, he would wipe out Boko Haram in 6 months. But after six years in office, we now know better. Buhari has failed in his promises to the electorate\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur economy is in tatters, corruption is growing in arithmetical proportion. Our security has collapsed to the extent that Buhari\u2019s government has become so helpless that it now negotiates with Bandits who are so powerful that they dictate the terms of the negotiation. Kidnapping, murder, rape and various acts of criminality pervade the length and breadth of the country unabated\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe clamour for Gen. Buhari to resign or be impeached is growing louder and louder every day\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a cover-up for his misdeeds, Gen. Buhari has resorted to silence the opposition by raising the false alarm that former military officers and prominent leaders of the ethnic organization and some Emirs are planning a meeting to pass a vote of no confidence in him. You will wonder even if that allegation is true when is it illegal or unconstitutional in a democracy for citizens to associate. Freedom of association is embedded in our constitution\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe also raises a false alarm that people are planning a coup. I assert Gen. Buhari has failed woefully, he has no clue about the problems facing Nigeria. He should go now before he plunged the country into a crisis the end of which nobody can foretell\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba people are the only ethnic group that has never called for secession. We have invested in a united Nigeria that we will resist any act that will lead to its break up. We will be in Nigeria as equal partners in a federal Nigeria. A Nigeria in which we will play a second fiddle is most unacceptable\u201d.\n\nTherefore, our irreducible minimum condition of staying in Nigeria is a restructured Nigeria. Anything short of that is \u2018\u2018to thy tent, oh Isreal.\u201d The unity of the horse and the rider in which a section of the country is the rider and we the horse is most unacceptable.\n\nAfenifere by our resilience and consistency over the years has proved to be the most reliable and dependable organization in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cI assert very confidently that from the First Republic we are the only national party in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is our consistent and persistent agitation for the right of minorities that has given birth to Edo, Delta, Rivers, Cross River and Akwa Ibom states in the South and Benue, Plateau, Borno, Kwara and the Adamawa States in the North\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur party manifesto of Free Education, Free Health and Integrated Rural Development as successfully implemented in the West is not confined to Yoruba land but applicable and implementable beyond Yoruba land across the length and breadth of Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfenifere is the beacon of progressive politics. The political philosophy of federalism propagated by our leader the sage Chief Obafemi Awolowo is now the sing-song all over the country today.\n\nI hereby appeal to all our members who for one reason or another have sojourned in the other parties to come back home, you will be welcome with open arms. There is room for the youth to rise to leadership on the merit of their performance\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is cheering that the call for the restructuring is no longer limited to Afenifere, PANDEF and Middle-Belt forum, The Northern Elders Forum, Arewa Consultative Forum have joined the crusade\u201d.\n\nWhile declaring the group support to the decisions of the Southern governors in their efforts towards tackling the problem of insecurity facing the country, Chief Adebanjo said, \u201cAfenifere welcomes and endorse fully the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum. And we hope Gen. Buhari in the interest of Nigeria unity, peace, tranquillity and economic progress give serious attention to the recommendation\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

I decided to use a reverse psychology on her. I told her whether she can work in a farm that hard drugs are kept as a secretary.\n\n\u201cShe said that she was ready to work. When she came, I told her this farm doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 that it was just a hoax.\n\n\u201cI told her that before we could even start I would like to have sex with her and she agreed but she gave a condition that I should use a condom which I agreed.\n\n\u201cWhile I removed the condom, she became furious and picked the nearby stabiliser to hit me on my head. She bit my left ring finger and tried to reach for the door, screaming.\n\n\u201cWhile I was bleeding, in a bid to stop her, I used the stabiliser she also used to hit her. And when I hit her she fell there after she died,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, his father was not around and never assisted him in any way to either kill or bury remains of the deceased.\n\nAsked why he invited the lady to his house when there was no job offer, the suspect said: \u201cInitially, I used reversed psychology on her. I have had very bad experiences with runs girls and prostitutes.\n\n\u201cI asked whether she can work in a farm that hard drugs are kept and she accepted. She even told me she took marijuana and cocaine.\n\n\u201cI felt that that was the best way to revenge for the runs girls and prostitutes. I used to patronise prostitutes but now I don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI am not happy about what has happened. But the Commissioner of Police has assured Akwa Ibomites and the entire world that justice will take its course.\u201d\n\nHis father, Frank Akpan, a retired Director in the Federal Ministry of Lands, said he didn\u2019t know about the crime until police invited him.\n\nOn the fact his son admitted to taking advantage of six girls in the compound, the father said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of that. The reason is that we just relocated from Abuja. I have not been around for 30 years.\n\n\u201cWe have been living outside. We just relocated because I have been retired. It is not even up to two years since we came back.\u201d\n\nHe denied ever being in the business of selling human parts as alleged.\n\nAsked to comment on the kind of justice he expects in the case, Akpan stuttered: \u201cI\u2019m not happy about what my child had done. I don\u2019t even believe this can happen to me after I had sent them to school, tried to bring them up. Yea, justice can be done if the system so permits.\u201d",

He has experience, power, acceleration, deceleration, he can dribble the ball and beat players.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fast, he has physical ability and he\u2019s experienced in big games and in the Premier League.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen we missed N\u2019Golo and Mateo in the same match we lacked a lot of quality, energy and experience.\n\n\u201cBilly Gilmour did a huge job in both games but it\u2019s not fair to compare him to these players because they have more experience and they are a step ahead in their development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we need in the key moments of the season. It\u2019s big news for us that Kova is back, he has a huge impact in the dressing room around big matches.\u201d\n\nKante formed a pivotal part of Leicester\u2019s Premier League title win in 2015 and will now go up against his old club in Saturday\u2019s Cup final.\n\nThe linchpin midfielder has been back to his very best under the German, with the Chelsea head coach delighted to have one of his chief lieutenants back in top condition.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s huge,\u201d said Tuchel. \u201cWe took the decision together, him, me and the medical team, to leave him out and give him this Arsenal match to rest and have treatment to his right Achilles.\n\n\u201cIt was pain management. It\u2019s not a huge injury, it\u2019s nothing you need to be afraid of getting bigger. It was just there, it was a bit annoying, just pain management and pain treatment.\n\n\u201cSo, he did all training sessions yesterday (Thursday) and today (Friday) full, no complaints. He will start tomorrow (Saturday) and very likely finish the game for us.\u201d\n\nChelsea\u2019s defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday has left the Blues exposed in their quest for a top-four Premier League finish.\n\nTuchel\u2019s men will face Leicester City again on Tuesday in a crucial league encounter.\n\nThe Blues boss accepts that the two quick-fire Foxes clashes could now prove the crux of the close to their season.\n\n\u201cThese are two finals and we don\u2019t think about anything other than the two finals,\u201d said Tuchel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the final for the Cup and the final for the top four.\n\n\u201cWe missed the chance against Arsenal to be decisive, have the decisive advantage. So, now we have to cope with it, and first of all show the reaction at Wembley to have the upper hand on Tuesday. And this is what we are up for.\u201d\n\n(dpa/NAN)",

          "title": "US chides Nigeria over religious intolerance, insecurity",
          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United States, has chided Nigeria over the level of religious intolerance and insecurity in the country.\n\nThe United States Department of State, in its 2020 International Religious Freedom Report on Nigeria, noted that the constitution barred the federal and state governments from adopting a state religion, prohibits religious discrimination, and provides for individuals\u2019 freedom to choose, practice, propagate, or change their religion.\n\nThe United States, in its executive summary of the report, also noted that the Nigerian constitution provided for states to establish courts based on Sharia or customary (traditional) law in addition to common law civil courts, although civil courts have pre-eminence over all other courts.\n\nThe United States further said sentences may be appealed from sharia and customary courts to civil courts, while also saying that in addition to civil courts, sharia courts function in 12 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccording to the United States, \u201cCustomary courts function in most of the 36 states. General insecurity throughout the country\u2019s regions increased during the year: a terrorist insurgency in the North East; brazen kidnapping and armed robbery rings in the North West and southern regions; militant groups and criminal gangs in the South South region; and conflict between farmers and herders over access to land in the North Central region. There were incidents of violence involving predominantly Muslim Fulani herders and settled farmers, predominantly Christian, but also Muslim, in the North Central and North West regions.\n\n\u201cThe government continued ongoing security operations and launched additional operations that it stated were meant to stem insecurity created by armed criminal gangs and violent conflict over land and water resources that frequently involved rival ethnic groups. Various sources said the government did not take significant measures to combat insecurity throughout the country; the International Crisis Group said that state governments relied heavily on armed vigilante groups to help quell the violence, which it said was counterproductive. Some said this lack of government response exacerbated insecurity and failed to address underlying causes. A report by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) stated the presence of state forces was \u201ctoo inconsistent and limited to protect or support communities, or mitigate and suppress violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government continued its detention of Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, head of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), a Shia organization, and his wife despite a December 2016 court ruling that they be released by January 2017. All the other members of IMN arrested during the 2015 clash with the military were released by February. On September 29, the Kaduna State High Court rejected a motion filed by El-Zakzaky and his wife to dismiss the case. The court adjourned the case to November and later to January 2021.\n\n\u201cDuring the year authorities arrested and detained two individuals under blasphemy laws: Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, sentenced to death for blasphemy on August 10, and 16-year-old Umar Farouq, sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. Authorities detained Mubarak Bala, head of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, in April without filing any charges, although his attorneys stated they believed he was being held on charges related to allegations of insulting Islam on Facebook. The government at both the federal and state levels put temporary limitations on public gatherings, including religious services, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Most churches and mosques throughout the country closed in April and May, during which time state governments arrested both Christian and Muslim leaders for violating lockdown orders. Beginning in June, the government\u2019s easing of lockdown restrictions included reopening religious houses of worship with prevention measures in place.\u201d\n\nThe United States further said terrorist groups, including Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa (ISIS-WA), attacked population centres and religious targets and maintained a growing ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch attacks against civilian and military targets across the North East, according to observers.\n\n\u201cThe groups continued to carry out a range of attacks targeting the local civilian population, including churches and mosques.\n\n\u201cViolent conflicts between predominantly Muslim Fulani herdsmen and predominantly Christian farmers in the North Central states continued throughout the year. Some religious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) continued to express concern that this conflict had religious undertones. In addition to religious differences, local authorities, scholars, and regional experts pointed to ethnicity, politics, criminality, lack of accountability and access to justice, and increasing competition over dwindling land resources as among the key drivers of the violence. Attacks and killings attributed to Muslim Fulani herdsmen continued during the year.\n\n\u201cAccording to ACLED data, total civilian deaths numbered 2,454 during the year, compared with 2,198 in 2019 and 3,106 in 2018. Some domestic and international Christian groups stated that Muslim Fulani herdsman were targeting Christian farmers because of their religion. Local Muslim and herder organizations said unaffiliated Fulani were the targets of Christian revenge killings. Local and international NGOs and religious organizations criticized what they said was the government\u2019s inability or unwillingness to prevent or mitigate violence between Christian and Muslim communities. Christian organizations reported several cases during the year of Muslim men kidnapping young Christian girls and forcing them into marriage and conversion to Islam,\u201d the United States added.\n\nThe United States also said its embassy in Abuja, the consulate general in Lagos and visiting U.S. government officials voiced concern over abuses and discrimination against individuals based on religion and religious tensions in the country in discussions throughout the year with government officials, including the Vice President, cabinet secretaries, and National Assembly members.\n\n\u201cEmbassy and consulate general officials further strengthened their engagement on religious freedom issues with a wide range of religious leaders and civil society organizations, emphasizing the importance of interfaith relationships. The ambassador and other senior embassy officials engaged with various religious groups throughout the year and delivered remarks on the importance of the respect for religious freedom at large religious gatherings. To mark Religious Freedom Day on January 16, the ambassador hosted an interfaith roundtable with religious leaders to discuss issues of peace and security and to promote religious freedom.\n\n\u201cIn July, the embassy held a roundtable with prominent religious leaders from different churches and dioceses in the country and discussed the violence occurring in the country, providing an overview of challenges and opportunities for affected communities. Interfaith discussions sought to identify areas of consensus and narrow the gap between competing narratives over the drivers of conflict in the country. Embassy officials and the Counselor of the Department of State met with religious leaders to discuss religious freedom and security during his visit in October.\n\n\u201cOn December 2, 2020, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, as amended, the Secretary of State designated Nigeria a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom and announced a waiver of sanctions that accompany designation in the \u201cimportant national interest of the United States,\u201d the United States disclosed.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, blamed the delay in supply of military hardware by manufactures for the handicap the administration is facing in fighting Boko Haram, bandits and other violent crimes in the country.\n\nHe stated this shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast at Aso Villa, Abuja, yesterday, while calling for understanding by Nigerians.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said: \u201cThe elite should make the attempt to understand the military. If we order for weapons and armoured vehicles, it takes time for the manufacturers to ship them, and when brought here, eventually, they are taken to training institutions, where we train the trainers before sending them to the field. This is a very long process. I expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at time and available resources.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we came in, in the North East, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South South in terms of security. Without security, you can\u2019t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest, and we are dealing with it.\u201d\n\nHe, however, vowed to use all available resources and manpower in dealing with bandits, to ensure that they do not create havoc against access to farms and food production in the coming farming season.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement coming after nearly six years in power is, however, seen by many as contradicting his 2015 election promise of ridding the country of all forms of terrorism and insurgency within the shortest possible time. Under his reign, violent crimes have been on the increase, spreading from the North East to North West and, lately, South east and South South where Fulani herdsmen and bandits have invaded communities, farmlands and schools, killing and kidnapping hundreds for ransom.\n\nThe president, while expressing the hope for a good rainy season this year, said \u201cthe law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land, so that we can get enough food for the country and even export.\u201d\n\nExplaining ongoing efforts to tackle the security situation in the country by the administration, Buhari drew attention to the series of long meetings held in recent weeks, chaired by him, saying that a part of resolutions had been made public by the National Security Adviser and the others kept secret.\n\n\u201cWith the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will understand the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in in 2015, what state we are today, both on security and the economy, and we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for its support, saying emphatically that \u201cthe National Assembly is cooperating very well. Within the resources available, they are certainly giving us priority on our (military) requests.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has thanked God for enabling them witness the end of Ramadan.\n\nShe appealed to Nigerian women to take responsibility of their children by guarding and protecting them against abuse and other vices.\n\n\u2022Young farmers urge emergency plan to forestall food crisis\n\nThe Nigeria Young Farmers Network has said an emergency national food security plan, that would actively engage the private sector, is critical to forestall the nation\u2019s imminent food crisis.\n\nThe Director General (DG) of the network, Mr Promise Amahah, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAmahah spoke against the backdrop of the relentless increase in prices of food and agricultural produce in Nigerian markets, which he warned might lead to a national food crisis very soon.\n\nHe said that government alone could not achieve reasonable progress in this regard, adding that more intensive action was required to address the challenge.\n\nAmahah said the Federal Government needed to provide the enabling environment for companies and startups providing solutions like storage facilities, logistics, payments, among others.\n\n\u2022Onyewuchi harps on justice, fairness\n\nThe Senator representing Imo East Senatorial District, Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi, has commended the Southern Governors Forum for what he described as their principled and patriotic position on various issues bedeviling Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Chiaka Alozie, the senator insisted that in line with the position of the governors, only justice and fairness can guarantee the unity and progress of the country.\n\nOnyewuchi bemoaned the hardship faced by millions of Nigerians, adding that there is an urgent need to address the rising insecurity, economic downturn and increasing agitations by different ethnic nationalities, for the restructuring of the country.\n\nHe said that Nigerians yearn for a country that works for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic and religious backgrounds, while taking into consideration the sensitivity of the diversity of the country.\n\nHe urged the southern governors to continue to work with other stakeholders to ensure that the dream for a better Nigeria is realised.",

          "text": "\u2022Cartel records lowest quota compliance in 12 months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry growth declined by 19.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to data from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOPEC, in a country-by-country analysis of developments within its member countries in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), said the previous month, it fell by 13.9 per cent, although the non-oil sector grew by 1.7 per cent.\n\nThe report showed that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 0.1 per cent year-on-year in Q4, 2020, following a 3.6 per cent contraction in Q3, 2020, which was the first positive quarterly growth in the last three quarters amid the gradual return of economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil sector expanded 1.7 per cent, recovering from a 2.5 per cent decline in 3Q,2020, mainly driven by growth in the telecommunications and information services sectors.\n\n\u201cOther important contributions came from the agricultural sector, which expanded by 3.4 per cent y-o-y in 4Q, 2020. Meanwhile, the oil sector dropped by 19.8 per cent y-o-y after a 13.9 per cent y-o-y contraction in 3Q, 2020,\u201d the report for May stated.\n\nIt stated that in 2020, the economy contracted 1.9 per cent y-o-y, following a 2.3 per cent y-o-y expansion in 2019, while inflation was still structurally high in the first quarter of this year, with the annual inflation rate jumping to 18.17 per cent in March 2021, the highest rate since January 2017 amid the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has also weakened the currency.\n\nMeanwhile, a surge in oil output by Russia and Oman in April lowered the compliance rate to the OPEC+ production cuts, with the nine non-OPEC countries that participate in the cuts overproducing by 347,000 barrels per day, equating to a compliance rate of 85 per cent, the lowest level for the 12 months that the pact had been in force.\n\nCompliance among the 10 participating OPEC countries, by contrast, was 123 per cent, thanks largely to the Saudis\u2019 additional voluntary reduction of one million bpd in February-April, which came on top of its official OPEC+ cut of 1.88 million bpd.\n\nThe average compliance rate for the entire OPEC+ group fell to 110 per cent in April from a record high of 113 per cent in March.\n\nThe non-OPEC partners\u2019 poor performance is certain to aggravate the Saudis and other Mideast and African producers, which have hit their targets in recent months which could create a tense atmosphere during future negotiations about opening the taps in the second half of the year.\n\nSaudi Arabia is looking to unwind its voluntary cut of one million bpd in May-July, which will necessitate winning back market share that it ceded in Asia when the voluntary cut was enacted in February.\n\nAlso, oil prices dropped by almost three per cent yesterday and were set for the biggest percentage drop since early April, after the restart of Colonial Pipeline, eased some of the concerns about petrol shortages in the U.S. East.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, West Texas International crude was falling by 2.94 per cent at $64.14 while Brent Crude was down by 2.64 per cent at $67.49.\n\nOil prices snapped the winning streak from earlier this week when reports from both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reiterated the view that global oil demand would rebound strongly in the second half of the year with more economies reopening and increased travel amid higher vaccination rates.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s bullish outlook on demand, coupled with a similar view from OPEC from Tuesday, sent oil prices to an eight-week high on Wednesday, almost hitting $70.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Boko Haram Scare: Law School DG Insensitive, Says NBA Chairman",
          "text": "Eromosele Abiodun and Nume Ekeghe\n\nThe Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikeja Branch, Mr. Bath Aguegbodo, has accused the Director-General of the Nigerian Law School, Professor Isa Ciroma (SAN), of being insensitive to the danger students billed to write their examination next week at the Bwari campus of the school would be exposed to due to the scare of bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\nHe said the students should be allowed to write the examinations scheduled to start from Monday at other campuses due to the reported security scare in the Bwari area.\n\nAguegbodo stated this yesterday when he appeared on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a breakfast programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think it would be out of insensitivity on the part of the director-general to continue to insist that the exams would be taken. If you look at the Chibok issue, there was intelligence information to both the security agencies and the management of the school that they were open to attack and they ignored it. I think it is important for everybody to apply pressure on the DG to see reasons.\u201d\n\nThe examination, he stated, must not take place in the Bwari, adding that there are other campuses where security concerns are not as serious as they are in Bwari.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit sad looking at things the way it is panning out; the security of students writing exams in Bwari should be paramount. I have listened to comments credited to the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, and the guarantees are given that security will be provided for students who will write the exams in Bwari.\n\n\u201cBut the question on my mind in the issue is security from where? Just last week, we heard there were attempts in the Villa. The Niger State governor had also said on two occasions that there were some communities in Niger State, which is less than two hours from where the law school is located, that has been taken over by the Boko Haram people,\u201d he said.\n\nAguegbodo added that the argument that JAMB is located at Bwari and some other universities that are located there have not shut down does not hold water.\n\nAccording to him, the psychological state of the students writing the exams must be considered.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat would be the mind of students writing exams when they have fears that they may be kidnapped?\n\n\u201cThe essence of the exams is to assess students as to their preparedness on what they have been taught. I do not see how a fair assessment would be done when a student is writing exams knowing fully well that the bandits are just about two hours away from them.\n\n\u201cThe unsettled mind would definitely reflect in the final result, which would not bring a fair assessment of what the exams are meant to achieve at the end of the day. If they could take their lecture in their various campuses, it would be the necessary thing for the government to look at it, that it is the safety of citizens first before the exams.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Council of Legal Education, attorney-general and the director-general of Nigerian Law school is that the safety of the students must be put into place if the examination is to be a fair assessment of what they have learned.\u201c\n\nHe also canvassed the postponement of the examination by one or two weeks.\n\nSpeaking on who should bear the cost, if the students were to be relocated to other campuses, he said it was the duty of the government to provide a conducive environment for the examinations to hold, adding that if the environment is not conducive, the government would have to bear the cost.\n\nParents of students at the Bwari campus had called on the management of the school to relocate the students to its other campuses owing to reported security scare in the area.\n\nThe worried parents, who insisted that the safety of their wards should be the priority, stated that they did not want to go through the same harrowing experience of parents of the Greenfield University students abducted by bandits in Kaduna recently.\n\nBoko Haram scare has created panic among the residents of the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in recent weeks.\n\nBwari town, an outskirt of Abuja shares a boundary with Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Obi, who is ordinarily versed with the workings of the South-East, but it is not sure whether he will be in the South-East alongside the reinforcements.\n\n\u201cYes, some troops are moving from the North-East to the South-East as reinforcements. They started moving from Wednesday. Among them are those from the 231 Tank Battalion; they are believed to be more trained in quelling uprisings,\u201d a top source confirmed.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on Tuesday held a meeting with the service chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, telling them to adopt certain security measures in the South-East and the South-South geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Tuesday reported that military sources familiar with the development said some of the measures which Buhari approved for the two zones were regular operational procedures to curb the growing violence.\n\n\u201cThe police and military have been recording casualties in the South-East during raids and gun battles with the criminals disturbing the region.

          "text": "Uduak Akpan, the prime suspect in the murder of Iniobong Umoren, the Akwa Ibom job seeker, says he killed her in self-defense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable Lifestyle had reported how the deceased, a recent graduate of the University of Uyo (UNIUYO), was found dead \u2014 few days after she was declared missing.\n\nAkpan was thereafter apprehended by the state police command for \u201ckidnapping, countlessly raping, and then killing the victim\u201d.\n\nAccording to the police, the suspected killer was said to have first buried the deceased in a shallow grave and fled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking when he was paraded by the police on Friday, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the job seeker.\n\nAkpan said after revealing to Umoren that he was lying about offering her a job, he had insisted on having sex with her before she could leave.\n\nThe suspect explained that the deceased had agreed but on the condition that a condom should be used which he agreed to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkpan said she, however, got infuriated after he removed the condom and consequently hit him on the forehead with a stabiliser.\n\nHe claimed that he had responded by hitting her with the stabiliser and a pressing iron which resulted in her eventual death.\n\n\u201cShe (Umoren) came for a supposed job interview and I decided to use reverse psychology on her. I asked her if she can work as a secretary in a farm where hard drugs are kept,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe said she can and that she\u2019s ready to do the job. At that point, I revealed to her that there\u2019s nothing like a farm and that it was just a hoax.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut I told her that before she leaves, I would like to have sex with her and she agreed. She, however, gave a condition that I should use condom, to which I agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen I removed the condom, she became furious and took the nearby stabiliser to hit me at the forehead and started screaming. I was bleeding so I needed to defend myself. I also took the stabiliser and hit her alongside a pressing iron. She started bleeding and died later.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my first victim. I\u2019ve not Killed anyone before but I have played the same trick on about six ladies before.\u201d\n\nUduak Frank Akpan paraded before the press today\u2026.. #JusticeForHinyUmoren pic.twitter.com/h0Luc6eF2A Advertisement \u2014 EKA (@Lionezz__) May 14, 2021\n\nHe, however, dismissed claims that his father and Kufre Effiong, his cousin, assisted him in carrying out the act.\n\nAkpan also quashed reports that some of the items found at his residence belonged to those he had tricked in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe NYSC shoes at the location was for the family, they belonged to my mother not my victims as claimed. The books are for my sisters and I,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAlso, my father didn\u2019t assist me as claimed. Nobody was around then. I didn\u2019t hypnotise her with any substance. Kufre Effiong is my cousin but he was not involved in the whole thing. My initial conversation with him was when I was coming from Calabar. He should pick me up on my way to submit myself to the divisional police officer (DPO).\u201d\n\nThe suspect said Nigerians should believe the police that justice would be done in the case.\n\n\u201cThe commissioner of police has assured Nigerians that justice will take its course in the matter, you the public should be calm. If justice in the case will cost my life, then I\u2019m okay with it,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, Andrew Amiengheme, the state commissioner of police, urged the public to disregard reports that the suspect had committed suicide in detention.\n\nThe development comes at about the same time when Umoren was burried amid tears.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "The Alliance for Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), a civil society coalition led by Femi Falana, senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), has advised those encouraging herders to reject modern animal husbandry to learn from countries that have adopted ranching.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, the southern governors had announced their resolve to ban open grazing and movement of cattle by foot in the region in order to tackle insecurity and address clashes between farmers and herders.\n\nBut different reactions have trailed the announcement.\n\nUsman Yusuf, former executive secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), had faulted the decision of the southern governors, saying the governors must provide land for herders to graze their cattle and that \u201cgiving a blanket ban is irresponsible\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Falana noted that the Northern Governors Forum, as well as the Nigeria Governors Forum had earlier resolved to ban open grazing, but the ex-NHIS boss did not condemn their decisions.\n\nHe said such \u201cdivide-and-rule tactics\u201d are designed to further polarise the masses, adding that the decision of the governors to ban open grazing is in line with section 1 of the land use act.\n\nFalana explained that herders are free to acquire land for cattle business, adding that any person who wishes to use land in any state is required to apply for a certificate of occupancy issued by the governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the virtual meeting of the Northern Governors Forum held on February 9, 2021, the members unanimously resolved to ban open grazing,\u201d Falana said.\n\n\u201cIn response to the call of the Northern Governors Forum for an urgent meeting, the Nigeria Governors Forum held a virtual meeting on the 11th February, 2021. At the meeting, the 36 state governors agreed by consensus to end nomadic cattle rearing in the country in order to end the incessant violent clashes between farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cAt its own meeting held at Asaba, Delta State on May 11, 2021, the Southern Governors Forum reiterated the decision of the Nigeria Governors Forum to ban open grazing in the country.\n\n\u201cCuriously, Professor Usman Yusuf has condemned the decision of the Southern Governors Forum on the ban. Even though he did not condemn the decisions of the Northern Governors Forum and the Nigeria Governors Forum, Professor Usman has argued that the decision of the Southern Governors Forum could not be justified under the Land Use Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSuch divide-and-rule tactics are designed to further polarise the masses of our people. In any case, the decision of all the governors to ban open grazing is in line with section 1 of the Land Use Act which has vested the entire land in every state in the governors on behalf of the people. Accordingly, any person or corporate body that wishes to use land in any state is required to apply for a certificate of occupancy issued by the governor.\n\n\u201cAs I had repeatedly maintained, the worsening insecurity in the country including the violent clashes between herders and farmers can only be seriously addressed if policy makers are prepared to abandon primitive ideas and embrace scientific solutions.\n\n\u201cThose who are encouraging herders to reject modern animal husbandry are advised to learn from Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya and Ethiopia that have effectively adopted ranching to end clashes between herders and farmers.\u201d",

One of the report highlights is that the company\u2019s revenues are up by 14.2% to $3.8 billion.\n\nOn the back of this revenue, Airtel Africa also posted net profits of $415 million, a slight growth of 1.8% from the previous year where it made $408 million in profits after tax.\n\nDespite the flat profit growth, it is still an impressive result for the business in a year where Covid-19 has stalled economic growth across Africa. Additionally, in Nigeria, the company\u2019s biggest market, a ban on SIM card registration stifled growth.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s CEO, Raghunath Mandava, said in a statement, \u201cIn these challenging times, I want to say a huge thank you to all our employees, our business partners, and governments and regulators who have supported us, and in turn facilitated our continued support to the economies and communities we serve.\n\nOur performance has been strong, \u201cwith reported growth of 13.6% in underlying revenue and 18.3% in underlying EBITDA, and constant currency growth of 19.4% and 25.2%, respectively. Contributions to this growth came across all regions, with particular improvement in Francophone Africa, and across all our major services, with mobile money, data and voice each posting double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nA look at the company\u2019s significant services shows that voice revenue continues to lead the way, bringing in more than half its revenue. Yet, that does not tell the whole story, as the growth in voice revenue has slowed over the last few years.\n\nData and mobile money revenue are the real stars of the show. Data contributed 35% to the revenue as it continues to show promise as Airtel deepens its investment in internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cData usage per customer reached 2.6 GB per customer (from 1.8 GB per customer) led by an increase in smartphone penetration and expansion of our home broadband and enterprise customers. This helped us grow data revenue 31.2% in constant currency. Growing penetration and usage of 3G and 4G data customers helped us grow data ARPU 8.2%. 4G data usage more than doubled in the year, contributing 62.2% of total data usage on the network in Q4\u201921.\u201d\n\nAirtel Money is also seeing significant growth, adding $401 million to revenue compared to the $311 million it added last year. According to Airtel, \u201cWe have increased the number of mobile money agents by 30.7%, kiosks by 68.8% and mobile money branches by 95%. Throughout the year, the expansion of our mobile money product portfolio, both through partnerships with leading financial institutions and through expansion of our merchant ecosystem, have further strengthened our mobile money propositions.\u201d\n\nAnother important update from the report is a leadership change at Airtel Africa as Mandava will retire from his post and as a director on 30 September. Olusegun Ogunsanya will take over as the new managing director and CEO.",

          "title": "A startup bill for Nigeria is being discussed between founders, investors and government reps",
          "text": "One landmark acquisition, several funding rounds and meaningful expansions have drawn attention to Nigeria\u2019s potential to become an enabling environment for businesses. Nigerian tech startups are raising larger seed rounds and pursuing unique global ambitions than at any other time in the last decade.\n\nBut in the last 18 months, major regulatory events that ended motorcycle-hailing and suspended cryptocurrency transactions through banks have been interpreted as setbacks to innovation.\n\nOne problem with these types of regulations is how sudden they are, seemingly without forewarning from the hammer bearers. They raise an unambiguous question: can startups really flourish in Nigeria?\n\nTo dispel such fears and sustain optimism about doing business in Nigeria, startup leaders are fishing for solutions with the cooperation of government officials. One urgent offer on the table is a Nigeria startup bill.\n\nMaking laws work\n\nLast weekend, Kola Aina*, founding partner of Ventures Platform, talked about a plan to \u201cco-create an executive bill that will support the growth of our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe event was a virtual ecosystem townhall with the theme Making laws work for startups in Nigeria.\n\nAina was joined by Adaeze Sokan, Ventures Platform\u2019s director of strategy and policy; Iyin Aboyeji*, general partner of Future Africa; and Adia Sowho, acting CEO of Thrive Agric.\n\nAlso on the call were Oswald Guobadia, senior special assistant to the Nigerian president on digital transformation; Ife Adebayo, special assistant to the vice president on innovation and entrepreneurship; and Jon Stever, managing director of Innovation for Policy Foundation (i4Policy), a consultancy.\n\n\u201cMany of us have tried to do business with certain countries and institutions, and many of them often cite regulatory uncertainty as the reason they can\u2019t interact with us,\u201d Sowho said, explaining the need for a startup act.\n\nApart from disruptive regulation, she listed weak infrastructure and difficulty accessing capital among the problems facing Nigerian startups.\n\nA startup act could be a first step in setting up a structure around these problems. Tunisia (in 2018) and Senegal (in 2019) passed startup laws under similar rationales. Startup acts are becoming recognised as a tool for policy innovation in Africa.\n\nGlobal standard, local context\n\nSo what should a Nigerian startup act look like? Firstly, it must reflect the country\u2019s present reality.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is overborrow from the context of other countries,\u201d Sowho said.\n\n\u201cWe need the minutiae of this bill to be from our experience and understanding of this country of ours that is just very difficult to compare to other places.\u201d\n\nThat said, Nigerian startups operate within a global business environment. For one, the majority of venture capital investment in the sector comes from foreign inflows. This binds startups to international standards on operations, ethics and ambition.\n\nAt the very least, Nigerian startups should have enabling business conditions similar to those being designed in Senegal and Tunisia, but also in Ghana (which passed Africa\u2019s first small business act in 1981), South Africa, Kenya\u2026 and with some effort, the United States.\n\nJon Iver of i4Policy making a presentation about small business and startup Acts in Africa\n\ni4Policy helped co-create Senegal\u2019s startup act two years ago. At the townhall, Stever showed a timeline of small business and startup acts in Africa; Nigeria was not present.\n\nHe observed that startup acts are not made through regular lawmaking processes but typically result from entrepreneurs taking the initiative themselves.\n\nBut something else is noteworthy: \u201cIn the cases where this has been really successful, there has always been a government champion that wants to listen to startups,\u201d Stever said.\n\nIt would then seem a good omen for Nigeria\u2019s startup bill plans that this townhall had two government advisors, who work at the intersection of digitization and entrepreneurship, in attendance.\n\nGuobadia called attention to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s new year address, about a need for \u201can enabling environment to turn [young people\u2019s] passions into ideas that can be supported, groomed and scaled.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s agencies have made some moves in this regard.\n\nIn 2018, the Office of ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OIIE) was involved in tech policy hackathons in Lagos and Abuja to develop frameworks for entrepreneurship and innovation. One goal of the Ministry of Digital Economy\u2019s 2020 \u2013 2030 strategy document is \u201c[supporting] digital entrepreneurs to develop innovative solutions for local and global challenges.\u201d\n\nIn April, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment announced that a draft National Policy on Startups was on the government\u2019s agenda. Otunba Niyi Adebayo, the minister, has made a point of attending startup-related events, whether about attracting investment or engaging startups on what they are building.\n\nCurrently in a virtual meeting with The Bulb Africa Partnership who are presenting a mobile money and peer-to-peer payment/market place and showing interest in setting up a tech hub/campus to support tech startups and train youth who are interested in pic.twitter.com/yqaxf9ReGY \u2014 Otunba Niyi Adebayo (@NiyiAdebayo_) January 7, 2021\n\nIs this another false start?\n\nIt is great to have ecosystem players take the startup bill bull by the horns. But there were reminders \u2013 from Mark Essien, Hotels.ng CEO, and Lexi Novitske, a venture capitalist \u2013 that we have sort of been here before.\n\nGuobadia agreed, but said the presidency has spent time assessing what it would take to do better this time. They have identified a process problem, which will be solved by a \u201cbig tent\u201d approach.\n\n\u201cWe are building a fabric to knit all [relevant] agencies into this initiative. We took the effort to avoid having competing conversations,\u201d Guobadia said.\n\nAina\u2019s presentation indicated that the Nigerian presidency intends to introduce a draft legislation as early as August. It will be based on a draft startup law by ecosystem leaders with input from federal and state stakeholders from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nThe plan for a Nigeria startup bill\n\nTimelines could shift but parties involved in this bill have been in conversations for about two months, Aina said.\n\n\u201cI am very aware that there is already an ongoing consultation with the Lagos state government,\u201d he said, mentioning that a presidential advisory group on the proposed bill has been having meetings.\n\nKola Aina is one of the members of the Nigeria startup ecosystem leading the startup bill efforts\n\nAboyeji said the plans are still evolving at the moment but he is optimistic that this time could be different.\n\n\u201cI think versus other times, we have grown to such a size and scale that is easy to see what the potential benefits of fixing this issue could be.\u201d\n\nHe and Sowho emphasised that a Nigerian startup bill that works will not be achieved without startups participating in the process. \u201cThis will require sweat from all of us and we should be ready to put the work in,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nThe group has set the ball rolling and welcomes interested people to volunteer for the effort by sending an email to partners@venturesplatform.com, or provide feedback through this form.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: TechCabal hosted this event and has a representative on the Advisory Board for the startup bill project. *Through their firms, Kola Aina and Iyin Aboyeji are investors in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.",

          "title": "Nupe Energy is turning gas cylinders into connected devices",
          "text": "According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) study, if a person inhales smoke while cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner, it is equivalent to smoking between three and 20 packets of cigarettes a day.\n\nOver half of the world\u2019s population still cooks over open fires. In Nigeria, it\u2019s worse as only 10 million have access to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders out of its 200 million population.\n\nEvery year, there are 4.3 million deaths attributed to cooking over open fires. The hazardous firewood smoke emitted from traditional cooking methods have more fatal consequences for women. Cooking with firewood not only affects women, it also endangers the planet causing nearly irreparable change to our global climate.\n\nNupe Energy is a renewable energy startup setting out to tackle this problem. Nupe Energy is born from the Nupe Project, a company that designs and develops innovative hardware products in Africa. The Nupe Energy team is made up of Damilola Onanuga (Design director), Funfere Koroye (Head, product) and Omafume Niemogha (Engineering). They recently received an undisclosed investment (seven-figure) from Geekonnect Africa led by Sam Uduma, who joins the team as strategic Lead.\n\nNupe Energy\u2019s proposed solution to Nigeria\u2019s over open fire problem is an LPG cylinder smart meter which intelligently controls gas flow, monitors cylinder fuel level remotely and facilitates gas purchase. The device, aptly named NUGAS, uses different cellular networks (2G/GSM/GPRS) to display LPG volume and prompt delivery through the cloud.\n\nThe smart meter works with the NUPAY app, an app that enables customers to prepay and postpay for gas using a mobile wallet or USSD.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal, the Nupe Energy team talked about the product and its progress since inception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently developing an IoT solution that ensures a constant supply of clean cooking for people. Our device uses hardware and software to make LPG available for households through a smart metering system. This allows customers to know they are about to run out of gas, and also alerts a nearby gas retailer for a refill to be made using the fastest route possible.\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nCost of the Smart meter\n\nThe smart meter currently costs $50 \u2013 a cost that is expected to reduce over time. Naturally, the first question I pose is: considering that more than 82 million Nigerians live on less than $1 a day, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, isn\u2019t a smart meter an expensive extra cost?\n\nI\u2019m quickly reminded of the fact that to reduce deaths by open fire cooking, the Nigerian government banned consumer ownership of cooking gas cylinders and put some policies in place to encourage local production of LPG cylinders. The federal government of Nigeria removed the value added tax (VAT) on LPG cylinders and imposed a 25 \u2013 30 % Import duty waiver on LPG equipment and appliances.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Techno Gas have built massive manufacturing plants with thousands of cylinders already circulating into Lagos to start with,\u201d said Koroye.\n\n\u201cThe cost of the smart meter is not paid at once by the customer. It is spread over a long period of time through their subscription. The cost of the meter is initially borne by the company which purchases it. Over time, the company recoups the cost of the meter from the customer.\u201d\n\nDealing with competition and regulation\n\nIt\u2019s normal to see bigger companies copy product ideas from startups. There are already a number of partnership conversations with LPG companies on the way, could one of these companies create their own smart metering system?\n\nOnanuga replies, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent two years researching and developing this product. Many of the companies we\u2019ve approached and the ones we\u2019ll be partnering with prefer to stick to their business model. They\u2019ll rather leave this sort of hardware/software to the professionals. Obviously, it\u2019s a risk but we\u2019ve invested enough to produce a superior product and see no threats at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government has a reputation of changing regulations on a whim. What happens if the regulation that supports this business model changes?\n\nNupe Energy sees Nigeria as the starting point and not its final destination.\n\n\u201cWhile developing this business and talking to different businesses, we\u2019ve received a lot of interest from other African countries and even outside Africa. So even though Nigeria is our initial market, we\u2019re not building for just Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, the adoption of gas is still growing; other cooking fuels like kerosene, firewood, and charcoal, can be bought in smaller units starting from \u20a6100 ($0.20) as opposed to gas that is sold in much larger quantities with \u20a6500 ($1.10) for between 1.5kg and 1.6kg being the lowest available price.\n\nNupe Energy still has hurdles to overcome. The startup relies on the wider adoption of cooking gas usage as well as the enforcement of government regulation. With only a handful of Nigerian companies designing and manufacturing in a country known for its import culture, Nupe Energy might just be one step ahead of its competitors.",

          "text": "Source: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nIn April, TECNO launched the Spark 7 series, a new addition to the brand\u2019s Spark line-up, now in its 7th generation.\n\nIn TECNO\u2019s usual way, the Spark 7 comes with a lot of impressive upgrades when compared to its predecessors under the flagship. For the purpose of this article, we will be focusing on the more popular of the series, the Spark 7P.\n\nOut of the box, the Spark 7P comes in four colour variations \u2013 the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations \u2013 which allows for vivaciously interesting choices to pick from when in the market to buy the Spark 7P device.\n\nSCREEN FOR MAXIMUM VIEW\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nThe Spark 7P\u2019s screen is impressively massive and elegant. The device comes with a bigger and better 6.8-inch edge-to-edge display and a screen resolution of 720*1600 HD, bringing to your fingertips an immersive cinematic experience. Without a doubt, movie lovers, gamers and even vloggers will enjoy unfettered fun in whatever form they choose.\n\nTOP-NOTCH PICTURE QUALITY\n\nSpark 7P\u2019s 8MP selfie camera appears in a notch at the top of the device, with 2 LED flash positioned on both sides of the camera. At the back is the 16MP dual camera, with a depth sensor second module that makes the device\u2019s Video Bokeh feature possible. The camera can record 240fps slow-motion videos. Users can also enjoy close-up photography with a 4cm macro photography mode that allows to capture small and minute details. Additionally, the device includes AI HDR technology to increase dynamic range beyond what is captured by the camera\u2019s sensors, allowing users to take photos with a higher dynamic range, fewer noise and clearer details.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nSummarily, with the Spark 7P\u2019s newly upgraded algorithm AI Camera 3.0 and AI scene detection, photos taken by the device will be much more impressive and attractive under any scenario.\n\nPRIVACY FOR A HIGH PERFORMING MACHINE\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nOne special feature that comes with the Spark 7P is the Peak proof which lets you leave a portion of your screen dark so you can keep personal information out of the glare of people when you use your phone in public places.\n\nThe Spark 7P also packs a punch with a powerful 5,000 mAh battery, so that consumers can run powerful applications and multiple tabs without the need to constantly recharge. The high-performance device that runs on HIOS 7.5 allows for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting the mobile device. The operating system is also bundled with utility applications that allow users to free up memory, freeze applications and limit data accessibility to applications. With the device\u2019s dark mode, the phone also gives users more battery time and decreased blue light emission, reducing eye strain.\n\nAnother highlight of the Spark 7P is its 90Hz refreshing speed. With the blazing-fast 90Hz refresh rate, the animation on the device doesn\u2019t have to look like a flip book, but one smooth, snappy, and refreshing experience.\n\nIn terms of storage capacity, the Spark 7P is available in sizeable 4GB ROM+ 64GB RAM and 4GB+128GB versions and is available at a sweet price range of 60,900 Naira and 68,800 Naira respectively.\n\nTECNO\u2019s Spark series targets trendy students, but has quickly risen to become popular among young working professionals and middle-aged folks. If you are expecting my verdict on the Spark 7, considering its sleek look and feel, camera, battery, high performance and price, I will rate it an 8/10.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIf your current phone has been giving you signals and warnings about its impending death, then you are in the same shoes with me. My phone hasn\u2019t been subtle about the fact that its end is near. Calls will come in and I wouldn\u2019t be able to take them no matter how hard I swipe the screen. Sometimes, I\u2019d take a call but won\u2019t hear a thing. The most annoying one is when the entire phone just freezes up on me, nothing I do works until when the phone decides on its own accord to get back to working. I have had just enough of that drama.\n\nTo be fair on the phone though, it really has served me, and I honestly shouldn\u2019t be complaining. In all the years I have used it, it gave no issues until its old age problems started very recently. I can say with all certainty that I made a great choice buying it. And that is what I plan to do again as I set out to replace it with a new one.\n\nImmediately I made the decision to get a new phone, I went into full detective mood. Getting a great phone with a short budget \u2013 and wisely so \u2013 isn\u2019t a joke, guys. Just to be clear; the search was for an affordable phone that had the recent mobile innovations and looked sleek enough to match my fashionable self. In other words, I want a functional phone that will offer me value for money and not make my savings disappear into thin air.\n\nAfter searching far and wide, up and down, almost turning over Google, my extensive research led me to TECNO Spark 7P, and that is the choice I have decided to stick with. Here is why;\n\nAdvertisement\n\n128GB ROM + 4GB RAM\n\nI am particular about the space on my phone. It can be so annoying to have to always delete my stuff to create space for new stuff every now and then. With Spark 7P\u2019s 128 GB ROM, I have all the space I need to store my favourites. That\u2019s one less thing to worry about in my life (it is the seemingly small things that make for a peaceful life. Trust me). Spark 7P\u2019s 4GB RAM provides stable and fluent performance, gaming, entertainment, and most importantly, multitasking will be fast and smooth. Note that the 64GB ROM+4GB RAM memory version is also available.\n\n90 Hz Refresh Rate\n\nSource: Oscarmini\n\nSpark 7P comes with a 90 Hertz refresh rate! You don\u2019t know what that means? Well, I didn\u2019t too. You see, the refresh rate measures how quickly your phone\u2019s display updates, in other words, how often and quickly the content on the screen refreshes. Measured in Hertz (Hz), the refresh rate counts the number of times the display refreshes every second it is on, 90Hz refreshes 90 times per second. And here is what that means for me; Spark 7P\u2019s high refresh rate will make moving content look and feel smoother and snappier. Even swiping through your emails and interacting with Instagram\u2019s UI will look smoother than the standard 60Hz rate which most smartphones have. For video content lovers like me, this refresh rate is a very big deal! It makes for clear, high quality videos as well as a smooth playback. The MediaTek G70 processor complements this experience by proving the speed necessary to execute every task thrown at the Spark 7P.\n\n5000mAh Great Power\n\nThe world is literally on the move. If you are anything like me, plugging in your phone after the first charge of the day doesn\u2019t always come easy. Carrying about the extra weight of a power bank became the order of the day. You can imagine how annoying that gets when your style for the day doesn\u2019t allow for a big enough bag that takes in the power bank. So, just guess how happy I was to find that phone with a huge battery. The Spark 7 P\u2019s 5000mAh powerful battery and its smart power-saving system satisfies my needs of staying juiced up for my daily activities and Lagos night life. Be gone power bank, Spark 7P to the rescue!\n\nSuper Night Mode Photography\n\nSpark 7P comes with outstanding camera features! Its 16MP main camera enables highly clear and more natural photos whether it is daytime or night. With its 8x digital zoom capability, great details can be seen clearly in every photo captured. That\u2019s not all. The device comes with great flash technology that effectively solves the problem of dim photos in dark environments. What stands out for me is how pictures taken with the Super Night Mode transforms pictures taken at night or in low light areas to supercool and clear photos.\n\nSource: Fisayo Fosudo\n\nLoaded with 8MP Al Selfie Camera, SPARK 7P will always be ready to capture my glamorous moments. With its dual front flash and Portrait HDR, brighter and charming selfie in a low light scenario will be so easy to take. The device will definitely offer me a smoother and funnier selfie experience. What\u2019s more, the smartphone, comes with great photo enhancement features; AI body shaping, AI Bokeh effects, AI HDR, AI scene detection, AI beauty mode, 120 frame slow motion photography, video chat beauty mode and so much more. Even my Instagram page will thank me for this choice!\n\nBright and Sleek Design\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me that my smartphone does not look bulky and bland. Spark 7P is the farthest thing from those. Its sleek body allows for a very comfortable fit in the palm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpark 7P comes in unique and lit colours that gives you a hard time making the decision on which to pick. And quite honestly, I still don\u2019t know which to go for between the Summer Mojito, Alps Blue, Magnet Black and Spruce Green colour variations.\n\nNeed I say more? Spark 7P checks all my boxes!

          "text": "On Saturday, May 8, 2021, the first dedicated Nigerian blockchain hub, Convexity Blockchain Hub (CBHUB), was inaugurated in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Stakeholders in the Blockchain Technology Association of Nigeria (SIBAN).\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the hub, Adedeji Owonibi, CBHUB Founder, says the aim is to create a hub ecosystem where people can come and just focus in a space dedicated to blockchain technology, a space to innovate and create solutions within Nigeria using blockchain.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, the hub will offer blockchain solutions that have absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigerian blockchain technology ecosystem is an arena relatively unknown to a lot of Nigerians. It is often confused with its more well-known subset, cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are popular uses of blockchain, it can also be used for other things, such as the solutions CBHUB would provide.\n\nThese solutions range from its Convexity Humanitarian Aid Distribution Solution (Chats), which is geared towards creating transparency in the aid distribution space to BitCert, one of its projects aimed at reducing certificate counterfeiting in schools.\n\nAs at launch time, CBHUB has partners in Lagos and also supports communities in Northern Nigeria, teaching classes in the local Hausa language.\n\nThis is a far cry from 2018 when Paxful, a leading Peer-to-Peer cryptocurrency exchange, reported that it would be launching a blockchain incubator hub. This hub was to be headed by Chimezie Chuta, the Founder of Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG).\n\nHowever, Chuta says that after reviewing the information provided, the company wasn\u2019t convinced of the initiative\u2019s viability as a self-sustaining business. Ultimately, Paxful decided to pull the plug.\n\nFirst cryptocurrency forensics lab in Africa\n\nThe first African crypto forensics lab was also launched at the event on Saturday. The lab boasts world-class facilities and is the result of a partnership with Chainalysis, a global leader in the cryptocurrency forensics sphere.\n\nA Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime Report cites South Africa-based company, Mirror Trading International (MTI), as the biggest crypto investment scam of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, illicit cryptocurrency trading accounted for just 2% of Africa\u2019s $16 billion trading volume from July 2019 to June 2020, with scams accounting for 55% of this low level of illicit activity.\n\nWhile Africa has the lowest numbers for illicit cryptocurrency trading globally, the launch of CBHUB\u2019s crypto forensics lab is yet another plus in the fight against crypto scams like MTI.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, there are ways to attach identities to blockchain users despite the relative anonymity/pseudonymity of the technology.\n\nAccording to Owonibi, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) can be aggregated from crypto exchanges, laptops, and phones through which people interact with the blockchain technology.\n\nThe hub will provide essential tools for crypto-crime investigators and security agencies constantly faced with numerous challenges while investigating crypto-based crimes and illicit money transaction activities.\n\nAll that the investigators need is to reskill and upskill on how to use these tools, says Chuta.\n\nConvexity, truly the first?\n\nWhile CBHUB is undoubtedly Nigeria\u2019s first dedicated blockchain hub, it is not the first blockchain hub to be established in the country. In 2015, Blockchain Tech Hub was founded by Samuel Benedict Ogbonnaya.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn profile, it \u201cwas established with the aim of pioneering Blockchain innovation in Africa by training and producing the best qualified Blockchain developers in Africa.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Blockchain Tech Hub is no longer in operation; the link to its advertised website returns a \u201cThis site can\u2019t be reached\u201d page. Attempts to reach Ogbonnaya were futile as his LinkedIn and Twitter accounts last recorded activity in 2019.\n\nNigeria and blockchain\n\nIn October 2020, NITDA announced that it had started developing a blueprint and strategy document for the \u201cNational Adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIt followed this announcement with the release of the Draft National Blockchain Adoption Strategy. The document outlines the roadmap and strategies for adopting blockchain technology by the government in its digital transformation agenda.\n\nIt also highlights the strategic objectives and initiatives that the government will actively pursue through designated Ministries, Departments, & Agencies (MDAs) during the stipulated period.\n\nWhile the Federal Government of Nigeria has so far been silent on its steps going forward, the launch of the CBHUB portends a step in the right direction in Nigeria\u2019s blockchain adoption journey, especially regarding education and skilling up.\n\nThis, of course, must be reviewed in the light of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest crypto order which threw Nigerian crypto traders into a panic in February 2021.\n\nCBN ordered banks to close the accounts of persons or entities transacting cryptocurrency or operating a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAt this stage, with its seemingly conflicting policies, two questions come to mind: Should Nigerian blockchain enthusiasts be cautiously optimistic? Would the Nigerian government take any more positive steps regarding blockchain soon?\n\nThe government\u2019s actions in the coming days should reveal more on this.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2021 Figures | Newsbites\n\nNew Episode!

The government directed that anyone participating in JAMB must have their NIN. This is beyond our control. Those who are yet to register should do so.\n\n\u201cThe mock exam is billed to come up on May 20. It is an optional exam meant to test the system. As you all know, the main exam is coming up between June 5 and June 19.\n\n\u201cShifting the exam date is not the solution, at the meeting we will discuss on how some of the problems encountered by candidates will be resolved.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja \u2013 Senate President Ahmad Lawan has cautioned States\u2019 Governors and other elected leaders against joining the agitations for secession or calling for restructuring of the country.\n\nLawan, who stated this while fielding questions from State House correspondents in Abuja on Thursday, said he was not against those calling for restructuring but elected officials must not be among those advocating for such calls.\n\nAccording to him, state governors must ensure that they restructure their respective states first before calling for restructuring at the federal level.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe call for secession or the call for restructuring, many are genuine calls even though I never believe that someone who is calling for secession means well or is a misguided person.\n\n\u201cBut I believe that when somebody calls for improving the structure that we have is a genuine call.\n\n\u201cBut I want to advice here, I believe that as leaders those of us who were elected must not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing because even if you are a governor you are supposed to be working hard in your state to ensure that this restructuring you are calling for at the federal level you have done it in your state as well.\n\n\u201cThis is because what you may accuse the federal government of whatever it is, you may also be accused of the same thing in your state.\n\n\u201cSo, we are supposed to ensure that we have a complete and total way of ensuring that our systems at the federal, state and even local government work for the people, and that we allow people to participate in governance so that whoever feels that he has something to offer to make Nigeria better does so freely without any hindrance.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe senate president said Nigerians must come together regardless of their religious, ethnic or political persuasions to find lasting solutions to the nation challenges.\n\nHe, therefore, called on all elected leaders across the three tiers of government to always avoid primordial sentiments capable of creating division and social discontent among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe should avoid partisanship, we should avoid regionalism. We are all leaders and we are in this together. The solution must come from us regardless of what level of government we are \u2013 whether at the federal, state or even at the local government level,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nLawan also frowned at the way and manner local government system was relegated to the background in the country, saying for the nation to address its security challenges the local government system must be functional and efficient.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity also to say that we have diminished the local government system. I think we can attribute some of the security issues to the lack of functional local government system.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the time has come for us to take up the challenge to ensure that the local government system functions. This is in keeping with looking for ways, for means, for solutions to the security challenges that we face. We must never neglect the local government system.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is one system that had worked even though in a different name. When it was Native Authority it was very effective, very efficient.\n\n\u201cSo, we must go back to our local government to ensure that the local government continues to be autonomous, continues to be functional in order to compliment whatever the States and the Federal Government would be doing.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who also spoke to the correspondents, called for a national spirit of oneness, saying that \u201cIf truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame for what\u2019s happening today.\n\n\u201cWhatever challenges we have, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve these issues we\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cWe must imbibe that spirit of oneness, togetherness, unity and love that would take us through this.\u201d\n\nHe enjoined Nigerians to always be their brothers\u2019 keepers and avoid acts capable of creating social unrest.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City, Nigeria\u2026Over 30 Nigerian Civil Society organisations have opposed the Archbishop of Canterbury support for Shell Carbon Energy Plan, and have requested the Archbishop to withdraw such support for a favourable Church of England position.\n\nIn a letter of 10th May 2021 signed by over 30 civil society organisations, convener of the groups, the Rev David Ugolor ANEEJ said that even though the organisation agree with the Archbishop that \u2018we all have moral and financial responsibility to address the climate emergency\u2019, they are \u2018extremely disappointed\u2019 and \u2018concerned\u2019 that the Church of England\u2019s Pension Board is lending its moral and financial authority to Shell, and plans to vote for Shell\u2019s climate and energy plan at its 2021 Annual Meeting.\n\n\u2018Nigeria has deep experience with Shell, and as representatives of Nigerian citizens\u2019 groups we wish to tell you that we feel that the company is the opposite of accountable to most Nigerians, and has a track record of making misleading statements and commitments. Shell should not be rewarded for setting a long-term ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nWe need urgent action now, starting this year. It is not acceptable for the Church to sign off on a Shell plan for this decade that makes no absolute carbon emission reduction pledges, includes huge increases in gas production, and relies on improbably large amounts of tree-planting. Indeed, Shell\u2019s rush to find land for \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 might well lead to further carbon colonialism, slavery and human rights violations in the global south. Aiming for net-zero carbon emissions has become another effort by polluting entities like Shell to avoid cutting emissions but rather continue in the harmful practices that drive global warming.\n\nNet zero is not zero emissions. It simply means polluting and assuming the equivalent amount of carbon is absorbed by trees or is mechanically captured and stored by an assortment of risky and unregulated geo-engineering proposals. Endorsing Shell\u2019s plan is akin to handing the corporation a right to toy with planetary systems while the poor and vulnerable continue to fight a losing battle against global warming\u2019, the CSO letter to The Most Revd. Justin Welby read.\n\nThe groups said that they strongly disagree with the Church of England position that the Shell goal on Carbon Emissions is \u2018clear and unambiguous, and Shell is accountable for delivering that target\u201d.\n\nThe letter to Archbishop Justin Welby said that because the Church of England has an important voice in the world on many topics, it must take responsibility to lead engagement with the company on behalf of the Climate Action 100+, an initiative involving over 500 investors worth $54 trillion.\n\n\u2018With the effects of climate change more visible every year, the future of our children is at stake, in Nigeria, Africa and around the world. We hope that you hear our call, and take urgent steps to ensure that the church reconsiders its position on Shell. Endorsing the cynical climate plan offered by Shell would mean believing that Earth systems operate according to the principles of calculus and negates the truth that the Earth is a wonderfully created system of interdependent and complex systems that no man can control by mechanical contraptions or imaginations for the sole aim of meeting shareholder\u2019s pleasure. We urge you to use all the tools available to you to encourage all parts of the Church of England to challenge Shell, rather than champion the corporation\u2019s climate and energy plan.\n\nWe pray you to continue to support our demands for ecological justice and the protection of our environment and will be happy to continue the dialogue with you as we look forward to a positive response\u2019, the letter to Archbishop Welby stated.\n\nCivil Society organisations that signed the petition against the Church of England support for Shell Climate Reduction Plan include:\n\n1.

It is hoped that at the end of first phase of the project, 4250 indigenes of Edo State will be empowered.

          "title": "How I lured, killed Iniubong Umoren \u2014 Suspected Killer",
          "text": "Uduak Akpan, the suspected killer of Iniubong Umoren, a job-seeker from Akwa Ibom, on Friday during a parade by the police, owned up to the crime.\n\nMr Akpan, who lured the 26-year-old graduate of University of Uyo (UNIUYO) with a fake job interview on April 29, killed her and buried her remains in a shallow grave in his father\u2019s compound.\n\nMs Umoren was confirmed dead on April 30 and buried on Friday at her hometown, Nung Ita, Ikot Essien in Oruk Anam Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nHowever, Nigerians online and offline have been demanding that Mr Akpan be brought to justice.\n\nThe police in the state have also assured that the culprit would be charged to court as soon as judiciary workers, who have been on strike for weeks, resume nationwide.\n\n\u2018How I killed her\u2019\n\nOn Friday, the police paraded Mr Akpan and his father, Frank Akpan, at their headquarters in Uyo, the state capital.\n\nResponding to questions from journalists, the younger Akpan narrated how he attempted to rape the deceased and eventually killed her using a \u2018stabiliser\u2019.\n\n\u201cShe (Ms Umoren) came for a supposed job interview in which I used reverse psychology on her. I asked her if she can work in a farm where hard drugs are kept as a secretary and she said she can\u2014 that she\u2019s ready to do the job.\n\n\u201cWhen she came, I revealed to her that this farm does not exist. There is no farm like that. It was just a hoax. I told her that before she leaves that I would like to have sex with her and she agreed. She gave a condition that I should use a condom, which I did. While I removed the condom, she became furious. She took a nearby stabiliser to hit me on my head and she bit my left ring finger and tried to reach for the wall, screaming.\n\n\u201cWhile I was bleeding, in a bid to stop her, I used the same stabiliser to hit her. She fell and started bleeding.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018stabiliser\u2019 Mr Akpan was referring to is a pressing iron.\n\nHe also confessed to having used the same \u2018reverse psychology\u2019 on not less than six women in the past, although he stated that Ms Umoren is the only one he had killed.\n\n\u201cShe is the only one I have killed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his relationship with Kufre Effiong, a civil servant linked to him in a report, Mr Akpan said he was one of those who came with the police to arrest him.\n\nThe report had speculated on a conspiracy between Mr Akpan and other persons suspected to be involved in human organ trafficking.\n\nThe report, without providing evidence, suggested some persons might have colluded to kill Ms Umoren while others engaged in a cover-up to free the suspect.\n\n\u201cKufre Effiong is my cousin. That was when I was coming from Calabar (to Uyo) because in the morning (of April 30), I went to Calabar. He (Effiong) was the one that picked me up together with the DPO of Urua police station (Samuel Ezeugo),\u201d said Mr Akpan.\n\nAccording to him, his conversation with his older cousin \u201dwas very short and simple\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe (Effiong) texted me the number of the DPO. I called him (DPO) when I arrived in Uyo.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs of the time of this reporting, PREMIUM TIMES could not access the conversation records of the suspect and those he spoke with and was, therefore, unable to determine the culpability or otherwise of Messrs Effiong and Ezeugo.\n\nMr Akpan also told journalists that he is an undergraduate in an unnamed university, where he is studying Public Administration.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not aware\u2019\n\nThe older Akpan, when speaking with journalists, said he was never aware of his son\u2019s criminal acts.\n\n\u201cI was not aware. I am not happy about it. When the police came to my compound, I was asked to recall him (from his trip to Calabar that day).\u201d\n\nMr Akpan revealed that he is a retired civil servant, who served in the federal ministry of health in Abuja.\n\nThe 64-year-old and father of three also said he relocated to Urua local government about two years ago and was not aware of his son\u2019s deeds.\n\nLike his son, he believed that justice should be dispensed accordingly.",

          "text": "BY ADEBIYI ADEDAPO, Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives has denied reports making the rounds in the media, which suggested that Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila was opposed to the call for restructuring of the country by governors of the southern states.\n\nThe House in a statement on Friday signed by its spokesperson, Hon Benjamin Kalu, noted that the report was misleading and does not represent the views of the speaker.\n\nKalu who reproduced the speaker\u2019s response, which was allegedly misrepresented, said there was no part of the statement that opposed the Southern Governors\u2019 call for restructuring.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the House has been drawn to several publications on online and traditional media claiming that the Speaker, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, is opposed to the Southern Governors\u2019 call for restructuring.\n\n\u201cThe House gathers that this allegation was attributed to statements made by the Speaker at a recent interview seeking his opinion on the issue. The House states clearly and unequivocally that the publications are false and misleading.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, below is an accurate reproduction of the statements made by the Speaker at that interview.\n\n\u201c\u2018This is not a time for name-calling or blaming one person or the other. If truth be told, we all have equal shares in the blame and whatever challenges we have, we all must come together. In the same way, we all have equal shares, we must all come together to make sure that we resolve whatever issues there are.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLike I said earlier, the greatest nations have gone through challenges worse than this and I believe that it is that spirit of oneness and that spirit of togetherness and unity and love that will take us through this. You know sometimes there are many things that people have said here and there and you never know where these things are coming from.\n\n\u201cSometimes God even puts you through challenges so that you can come out of it stronger, bigger, better, bolder. That\u2019s what I believe is gonna happen to Nigeria. We\u2019re all put together in this one geographical space for a reason. It wasn\u2019t by happenstance or coincidence or by chance. It was ordained by Almighty God and He doesn\u2019t make mistakes, He doesn\u2019t go wrong. What He decrees is what will be and I believe He put us all together.\n\n\u201cNo matter your religion, no matter your ethnicity, talking about over 250 ethnic groups in one country, it is that diversity that God had foreseen that I believe we should tap into as Nigerians. I have belief in the Nigerian resilience and in the Nigerian spirit; and in the spirit of Ramadan, we must continue to pray.\u201d\n\nKalu, therefore, urged Nigerians to disregard the said report and continue to pray for a peaceful Nigeria.",

          "title": "Additional polling units: INEC\u2019s leap, citizens\u2019 confidence",
          "text": "Polling units (PUs) remain essential in every democratic electoral process. This is largely because it is the last channel via which citizens exercise their constitutional right, vote and be voted for. With limited polling units across the country, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE take a look at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC\u2019s) decision to create additional polling units nationwide.\n\nPUs then and now\n\nThe law guiding elections in Nigeria, the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), which defines a polling unit as \u201cthe place, enclosure, booth, shade or house at which voting takes place under this Act\u201d (Section 156-interpretation), also empowers INEC to establish adequate number of PUs in the country and to assign voters to them. This is explicitly stated in Section 42 of the Act, thus: \u201cThe Commission shall establish a sufficient number of polling units in each registration area and allot voters to such PUs.\u201d\n\nHowever, since 1996 when the defunct National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) established the current 119,973 existing polling units to serve no fewer than 50 million registered voters and with 700 per units, INEC since its establishment in 1998 has not increased the number of the polling units despite an increase in the population of registered voters.\n\nAs the population of registered voters continued to increase, like it was witnessed in 2019 when it rose to 84,004,084, many political stakeholders have lent their voices to the creation of additional polling units for voter access.\n\nNotably, INEC attempted to create additional polling units in 2007, when the Commission created what it named baby units in the FCT. These baby units were an offshoot of the existing units which are located in the area of need.\n\nSimilarly, as contained in INEC\u2019s 2021 discussion paper the State of Voter Access to Polling Units in Nigeria, it in 2011 also introduced voting point; this is a voters grouping system that enables the Commission to re-group large polling units into smaller clusters (voting points) to ease voting. Though this has been accepted by most Nigerians and all stakeholders, the smaller clusters, voting points, over the years have failed to address the problem of low voter turn-out which is largely caused by the inability of many to travel to their PUs as the election movement restrictions and in some cases crowded PUs.\n\nThe last attempt was in 2014 during the build-up to the 2015 general elections, when the Commission proposed an additional 30, 070 new polling units. Unfortunately, it jettisoned the idea and reverted to the use of a voting point for the 2015 general elections over what it described as \u201cunfounded allegations and negative propaganda\u201d from some sections of the media.\n\nNationwide verification exercise\n\nThe Commission on May 4, this year, commenced a nationwide verification exercise for centres proposed for voting units to be converted to polling units.\n\nIts chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this when he visited some of the proposed centres and existing polling units in the FCT and Nasarawa state, said the purpose of the verification exercise was to ensure that the right thing was done in the conversion of the voting points to polling units.\n\nHe also said, \u201cAll the national commissioners are out, visiting the states of the federation to verify the work of converting the voting points to polling units.\n\n\u201cSo, we decided from the headquarters to visit some of the polling units and voting points in the FCT and also in the Karu local government area, Nasarawa state. You will recall that as part of our engagement with stakeholders, we show images of one of the congested polling units in the country from Karu in Nasarawa state.\n\n\u201cSo, I have to verify that the right thing is being done in converting those voting points to polling units and relocating them in line with the Commission\u2019s guidelines.\u201d\n\nNeed for expansion\n\nThe Commission stated that the objective of expanding the polling unit is to address low voter turn-out, among others. The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Jigawa state, Dr. Mahmuda Isah, said this recently at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on expanding voter access to polling units in Dutse.\n\nIsah said other objectives are to improve the health safety conditions at polling units in compliance with Covid-19 protocol during the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe expansion, according to him, is also to digest existing polling units by reducing the number of voters per polling unit and ensure better access at polling units for persons with disability.\n\n\u201cA practical review conducted by the Commission in 2014 revealed that many polling units recorded an excess number of voters. Some units exceeded the designated figure of 500 voters per polling unit to a couple of over 4,000 registered voters,\u201d he said.\n\nIPAC\u2019s reaction\n\nIn his reaction, the chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Dr. Leonard Nzenwa, said the creation of additional polling units \u201cwill make the job of political parties easier.\u201d\n\nNzenwa in a phone chat with this reporter said, \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction. It must be done with sincerity of purpose to capture all stakeholders that this time around, the areas that were not captured will be captured this time. Why we need additional polling units is something that is welcome. We had a population of fewer than 50 million voters in 2015 and we now have 85 million.\n\n\u201cWe have had an increase in prospective voters, so additional polling units are also required to take care of this number of voters. So, it\u2019s a step in the right direction and done to accommodate those not captured previously. To IPAC, it\u2019s a welcome development.\u201d\n\nOn what benefits additional polling units will bring for the political parties and the electorates, Nzenwa said, \u201cFor the electorates, it will make access to polling units easier. In the past, we had people travelling more than two kilometres to get to polling units. Now, the polling units will be closer to most of the electorates.\n\n\u201cFor political parties, it will make their job easier. When you have the polling unit closer to the electorate, the task of creating awareness and directing the electorate to vote becomes easier. In terms of the larger stakeholder, it will restore some level of confidence and make them partake actively in the electoral process and to deepen our democracy.\u201d\n\nOn the fears of effective management and transparency, the IPAC boss noted that, \u201cA grown-up woman will surely get married one day, get pregnant and deliver a baby. She cannot ignore any of the above because of pains. Therefore, because of fears and deep concerns, we cannot be stagnated. We have to move on. We can\u2019t get everything perfectly one day. It\u2019s usual experimentation until we get there. The increase in voters registration is a clear indication that people want to cast their vote.\n\n\u201cSo, do we on account of fears remain at the level we had less than 120,000 polling units. It doesn\u2019t make sense. As we have more voters, there is a need to open up space and create polling units closer to them. Fears are welcome and justified, but we must find a way to grow our democracy, which is growing our polling units, which is a crucial aspect of our democracy.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 views\n\nMeanwhile, a political analyst, Jide Ojo, has said \u201cif INEC successfully creates additional polling units it will guarantee better voter access.\u201d\n\nOjo, in a telephone chat with Blueprint Weekend, said, \u201cAdditional polling units, in my considered view, are long overdue. If stakeholders can agree with INEC, it will guarantee better voter access.\n\n\u201cThe last time we created polling units was in 1996, that\u2019s 25 years ago. All attempts to create additional polling units have not been successful. Professor Attahiru Jega, when he was INEC chairman, did try to create 30,000 polling units but it was resisted on the excuse that the South-South People Assembly led by Chief Edwin Clark felt it was lopsided in favour of the north against the south. We have had to live with that decision up till now.\n\n\u201cBetween 1996 till now, the expansion has not taken place up till now. If you look at Abuja, as of 1996, it was barely 6 years after the relocation of the capital from Lagos to FCT. Abuja was a jungle then.\u201d\n\nHe said further that, \u201cIf we continue to work on the polling units that were available then, it means a lot of people will be disenfranchised. That has warranted a low voter turnout. During election time, the economy will be shut down. If you registered far away from home or workplace, you will not find it easy going to vote. INEC made it a policy to vote where you were registered.\n\n\u201cThis is to guarantee better voter access. CSOs and the media should be able to follow up to ensure we don\u2019t end up having polling units in the jungle or traditional ruler\u2019s palaces or awkward places. Polling units have to be sited in neutral places, away from residences. I wish INEC could imitate Egypt and come up with a policy to site polling units in only public schools. Those are neutral places no one can lay claim to and not residential areas that politicians can manipulate and lay claim to. You can have up to 10 polling units in a particular school for convenience, it\u2019s all about demarcation.\u201d\n\nOn the impact the additional polling units would have on the 2023 general elections, Ojo said, \u201cAhead of 2023, if it is concluded on time for INEC to sensitise people, it will be good because there is the advantage of voter access. It will guarantee more people access to polling units. However, the implication is that your name will no longer reflect where you used to vote before as a result of the creation of these additional polling units. This is because many people will register during Continuous Voter Registration; so, INEC will distribute them according to alphabetical orders. So, those voting in a particular polling unit since 1999 may experience a shift to another polling unit.\n\n\u201cSo, there will be a need for public enlightenment for people to check their names and where they will henceforth be voting. That has to be done well ahead of 2023, particularly in states that will be having bye-election and governorship elections. That will also increase voter turn-out if the exercise is done successfully.\u201d\n\nLimited manipulations\n\nAnother analyst, Aminu Mohammed, is of the view that additional polling units will heighten voter confidence in the nation\u2019s electoral process, INEC and that manipulations will be limited.\n\nMohammed told this reporter that, \u201cSo many of us, for so many years, have been clamouring for the creation of additional polling units even though a few in the past came up with propaganda to stall the plan some years ago. But today, especially to those who care about our democracy, it is obvious that with an increase in registered voters there is certainly a need for creating additional polling units.\n\n\u201cWe have about 120,000 polling units with some voting points, but yet many Nigerians are disenfranchised as a result of long-distance polling units, crowded polling units and others. So, to show that INEC and other stakeholders care about the growth of Nigeria democracy, then they must work to solve the problem of low voter turn-out due to limited polling units. And the best way to address this is by creating additional polling units.\n\n\u201cWhen additional units are created it means more people, if not all registered voters will vote. It will give voters easy access, make voting more convenient and even enable the process to be more transparent. Instead of having over 700 voters in a polling unit, with additional units, smaller voters will exercise their constitutional rights in units.\n\n\u201cThis also means an increase in voter turn-out, small number per polling units, speedy process and limited manipulation. When there is a fewer number per polling unit, security personnel, observers, party agents and other stakeholders will be able to do their work effectively to limit electoral manipulation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFor political parties and their candidates, with additional polling units, they will spend more money to mobilise agents and station them in those polling units. But it will also help them.\n\n\u201cIf more polling units are created, voters will know that stakeholders and INEC want them to have a say and exercise their right to vote in or out political leaders. So, the creation of additional polling units will boost the voter confidence in INEC and will also enable the process to be more transparent.\u201d\n\nAPC chieftain\u2019s take\n\nWhen asked for his reaction, a foundation member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the director-general, Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, said the on-going creation of more polling units by the INEC \u201cis a welcome development.\u201d\n\nExpressing confidence in the current leadership of the electoral body, he said having more polling units \u201cwill demolish collation centre banditry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have implicit confidence in Prof. Mahmood Yakubu leadership of INEC, especially in their upgrade of electoral management. They have demolished collation centre bandits, by popping up polling units on their platform. In this vein, one supports the creation of additional polling units as our population increases.\n\n\u201cI know of many wards that witnessed increase in population and migration for one reason or the other. Such wards need to have more polling units,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: Alkasim Abdulkadir provides rare insight into the fight against insurgency, nation building and why Nigerian youths must chase money",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: How special needs students are struggling against the Nigerian educational system",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 5\n\nBy: Olatunji Olaigbe\n\nOn the 20th of March, 2021, Jamiu Jibril, a visually impaired student sat to write his Master\u2019s entrance examination at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ilorin. He had an aid who read out the questions and wrote down his answers for him, and like the non-special needs student sitting for the exam, he was given two and half hours.\n\nThroughout Jibril\u2019s academic journey, he has had to depend on the goodwill of other students and his extra-thrust for knowledge to go through school. The University of Ilorin, the same tertiary institution he got his graduate degree from, never provided him with special needs resources.\n\nHe remembers going to the university\u2019s center for special students one day and being told \u201cthe center was for deaf students, and not the blind. Everything I did, every assistance I got, was on me,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nLike Jibril, special needs students in Nigerian tertiary institutions struggle against myriads of problems in the quest for education.\n\nIn a research by Abubakar Ahmed, Zakaria Al-Cheikh Mahmoud Awad, and Mastura Adam; Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and Kano University of Science and Technology (KUST) were scored 26.7% and 13.3% respectively in their accessibility to the mobility impaired, noting: \u201cOnly 272 special schools, homes, centers, and integrated school cater for the education of Special needs children in Nigeria; a country whose Persons living With Disability (PWD) population was put at 19 million. Only 10% of the over 19 million disabled are receiving education in Nigerian educational environment.\u201d\n\nThe 272 represents a totality of both special needs institutions, built specifically for special needs students, and seemingly \u201cinclusive\u201d institutions \u2013 meaning they provide education for non-special needs and special needs students. But how true is the statement?\n\nIn the University of Ibadan, the department of special education is a two-storey building with no ramps or supportive devices for special students other than the auditorily impaired. This makes it hard for students with other forms of disability to move around the building, getting education.\n\nTola Alli, NewsWire.\n\n\u201cMobility impaired students have to stick to the lower floors and in unavoidable cases, they have to find someone who can assist them up the stairs\u201d, says Nimi, a student of the department. \u201cEven non-disabled students have issues getting education in the University, imagine what it\u2019s like having a disability with that.\u201d\n\nThe presence of PWDs in an institution does not directly translate into true inclusivity. Most institutions lack resources and infrastructure for special needs students. For Jibril, who has visited several institutions while representing his faculty, the University of Jos is the most special needs-friendly institution he\u2019s seen, scoring 50% by his own discretion. \u201cThe University of Lagos could be scoring 80%, because they have a lot of resources and infrastructure, but they lack the motive to use these resources.\u201d\n\nA special needs-friendly institution for an auditorily impaired student can still be non-friendly to a mobility impaired, or a visually impaired student.\n\nIn the university of Benue, Akin, an auditorily-impaired student struggles in comprehending what is being taught because the university has no audio-to-sign language interpreter.\n\nAt the University of Ilorin, Victor, another auditorily impaired student of Computer Science Education faces a different shade of the same problem. The University of Ilorin provides interpreters, \u201cbut there are not enough,\u201d says Victor. Citing that this places a lot of stress on the available interpreters. He added, \u201csometimes, the available interpreter is not familiar with me or the course being taught, [and then] misinterpretations happen.\u201d For him, just as it is for every other student, getting what is being taught right is the tiny margin between a hardworking student and an intelligent one.\n\nQuoting the answers to research questions by Education Data, Research, and Evaluation Nigeria (EDOREN):\n\nThe schools have facilities that meet the needs of all learners, such as separate toilets for girls, ramps (not stairs) for learners with physical disabilities and tactile floor guide: NO\n\n\u201cTeachers have high expectations for ALL children, believe they all can learn and encourage them to complete school: NO\n\nTeachers know about the conditions that cause physical, emotional, and learning disabilities; and can help learners to get proper care: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nTeachers adapt curriculum, lessons, and school activities to the needs of learners with diverse backgrounds and abilities: NO\n\nLearners are involved to actively participate and develop guidelines/rules in the school to improve inclusion, reduce discrimination, violence and abuse: NO\u201d.\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nIn place of the margin between literate and non-literate PWDs in Nigeria, the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) implemented a policy encouraging institutions to make 10% of their population PWDs, \u201cbut I can assure you that\u2019s not the reality,\u201d says Jibril.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria introduced the National Policy on Special Needs Education, its first document fully dedicated to the interests of people with special needs.\n\nIn 2016, it also introduced the National Policy on Inclusive Education, which aimed to provide education to everyone. Promising to \u201coffer a quality education for all while respecting diversity\u201d. The policy defined itself as \u201cabout removing barriers to learning and involving all learners who otherwise would have been excluded through marginalization and segregation.\u201d\n\nOn 17th, January 2019, President Muhammed Buhari signed the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act \u2013 even promising the conversion of existing building structures into inclusive ones.\n\nBut most of these policies are lost in transition, not being translated into actions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need for more inclusivity policies, but more need for the enforcing of already existing policies. There\u2019s a need for institutions to improve on their inclusivity.\u201d says Dr. Azubike Onuora-Oguno, a Teaching Research Fellow on Human Rights Law and Society at the International Institute of Social Sciences, Netherlands. And a senior project manager of the Disability Law Advocacy Project \u2013 an Open Society Initiative of West Africa (OSIWA) project aimed to make academic curriculums in Nigerian Universities special needs friendly.\n\nThe majority of problems come from the government, but the public has a part to play too. \u201cWe all have an obligation to accommodate PWDs, but this can\u2019t happen until we understand the concept. Parents, people have to understand that PWDs are humans, meant to be acknowledged as such,\u201d says Dr. Azuibike. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s a need for deep-seated sensitization that will make us act reasonably towards PWDs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need understanding, EMPATHY, not SYMPATHY,\u201d types Abiola Dada, a special needs student at the University of Ilorin.\n\nJibril is a broadcaster at Royal FM, Ilorin, and when Jibril isn\u2019t busy with work or academics, he tutors other students in his Faculty. \u201cOn most days, the university is crowded. There\u2019s the bus fight, students literally gnawing their way through the queue. What happens to me? Do I sleep in school?\u201d Asks Jibril.",

          "title": "Murder in Uyo: Who Killed Hiny Umoren?",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 15\n\nOn Friday April 29, a 26 year-old lady set out around 1PM to attend a job interview in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Having recently completed her university program despite losing both parents, she was looking for a way to support herself before being called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) program.\n\nInstead of a job interview and hope for the future however, what she would actually encounter on that day would become one of the most shocking stories to ever emerge from Nigeria.\n\nY'all my friend @HinyHumoren is in trouble and she needs our help.\n\nI'm currently in Lagos and I can't help than to put this out there.\n\nEarlier today she told me she was going for a job interview at airport road which is quite far from her house. pic.twitter.com/X1YBLUPO7d \u2014 Happiness Activist #justiceforHinyUmoren (@UmohUduak1) April 29, 2021\n\nIniobong \u201cHiny\u201d Umoren became the subject of a desperate nationwide search led by Nigerian Twitter users after her friend Umoh Uduak put out an urgent appeal. She was eventually found, but unfortunately the worst had already happened. The police would later confirm that she was found dead, having been raped, murdered and then buried in a shallow grave.\n\nIn the wake of a crowdsourced social media sleuthing campaign which uncovered his identity, a primary suspect Frank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan was also arrested.\n\nIn a manner completely uncharacteristic of Nigeria\u2019s elephant-paced justice system, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command rapidly announced that it had extracted a confession from Akpan, and even identified his motive \u2013 he was a serial rapist and serial killer acting alone. End of story and job done.\n\nNaturally, this neat explanation did not satisfy many, who felt that Akpan could not have acted alone, and that the police might be involved in some kind of a cover up to protect powerful people potentially implicated. Rumours also began swirling about Hiny\u2019s family receiving death threats, and the suspect allegedly boasting about being well-connected.\n\nBeyond the whispers however, there has been precious little to substantiate the idea that stringing up Frank Akpan alone would not represent any kind of justice for Hiny Umoren. Sources willing to speak up and provide information about this case have generally not been forthcoming.\n\nUntil now.\n\nGame Changing Information\n\nEvery telephone conversation made via a GSM telephone line has a permanent record with the mobile service provider, which by law cannot be tampered with or erased. The information captured can vary, but it always includes the following elements: the date and time the interaction was initiated; the type of interaction (voice or SMS); the length of the interaction; the number initiating the interaction; the number receiving the interaction and the location of the closest cell towers to both parties.\n\nSome networks also record the actual conversation (voice note), and depending on the type of signal band and mobile device, it is even possible to capture the exact location of both parties, accurate to within a few metres. Anyone who can get their hands on the call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s line would very quickly be able to establish whether he was in fact acting alone \u2013 which is where my source came in handy.\n\nUnderstandably, this information is meant to be impossible to access without law enforcement authorisation. With this in mind, I have taken the extra precaution of reproducing it manually via a spreadsheet, so as to protect my source by removing all possible identifying information. Over the course of several hours last week, I pored over several days worth of leaked call data from Frank Akpan\u2019s mobile provider to make sense of the situation.\n\nWhat will be presented in this story is the closest thing that exists to objective evidence that:\n\n1.) Frank Akpan is being used to take the fall for much bigger fish involved in Hiny Umoren\u2019s murder; and\n\n2.) While Frank Akpan is certainly the primary suspect and was directly involved in the murder, there are other participants in the murder still walking free, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command intentionally bungles what should be an open and shut investigation.\n\nWho is Frank Akpan?\n\nApart from a few tidbits pieced together from social media accounts about him, very little is known about Frank Akpan the primary suspect. The timeline to his arrest begins late in the afternoon on April 29, when Umoh puts out Hiny\u2019s number hoping someone will be able to track down her friend\u2019s location.\n\nThe mention of \u201cFrank Akpan\u201d as a central figure in this story begins with this tweet from Umoh which identifies the owner of the Airtel number +2348127530092 as the person who invited Hiny for the supposed interview.\n\nA quick check with Truecaller brings up the name \u201cEzekiel Akpan.\u201d Curiously, the occupation tag on this person\u2019s Truecaller profile reads \u201cPolitical.\u201d It is important to bear in mind that Truecaller fills an individual\u2019s \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018occupation\u2019 fields by pulling high quality data from several sources including Facebook profile information and analysis of the individual\u2019s Facebook friend networks \u2013 so this tiny detail will become significant later on.\n\nShortly after finding himself under instant national scrutiny following Umoh\u2019s tweet, Akpan then attempts to throw the public off the scent with the Facebook post below. In so doing, he inadvertently confirms that the telephone number in question is actually his, thereby proving that \u201cUduak Frank Akpan\u201d and \u201cEzekiel Akpan\u201d are the same person.\n\nShortly thereafter, he deactivates his Facebook profile and seemingly goes silent until the Akwa Ibom State Police Command issues a statement 3 days later, confirming his arrest and effectively pronouncing him guilty of the crime as a sole suspect.\n\nFrank Uduak Ezekiel Akpan\n\nSo far, based on the version of the story that is in official circulation, there is only Frank Akpan and the unfortunate Hiny Umoren. The police have declared him a serial rapist \u2013 and hence a single actor. Officially, the issue is over and there is nothing more to see here. It was just a horrible monster and a woman who unfortunately fell victim under the most heartbreaking circumstances.\n\nThe only counter-story so far boils down to a few unsubstantiated social media rumours that cannot stand in court, plus what would otherwise be compelling evidence from Akpan\u2019s crime scene, which unfortunately has now been contaminated and rendered all but useless for the purpose of a criminal investigation.\n\nUduak Frank Akpan specialized in luring and kidnapping job seekers, youth Corp members, students and pupils, killing them, cutting off their sensitive parts, bury them in shallow graves then exhume their bones after decaying to sell off for more rituals#JusticeForHinyUmoren pic.twitter.com/BeexbP11wf \u2014 DR.PENKING\u2122 #JusticeForHinyUmoren (@drpenking) May 7, 2021\n\nBy deliberate malfeasance or by incompetence, the Akwa Ibom State Police Command has allowed key evidence from Akpan\u2019s hideout potentially pointing to a larger conspiracy, to be trampled underfoot by hundreds of curious onlookers and social media content creators. In so doing, the evidence to build a case for anything other than a standalone Frank Akpan conviction has been destroyed or rendered inadmissible.\n\nThere is however, one type of evidence that cannot be physically destroyed or tampered with in any way. This evidence has a permanent digital record which sits in cloud storage away from the incompetence or malfeasance of the Nigeria Police Force, and what it shows without a shadow of doubt is that Frank Akpan did not act alone.\n\nLeaked Network Records: The Smoking Gun\n\nTo properly understand and contextualise the data that you are about to see below, a little explainer is in order. As mentioned earlier, the 6 categories of telephone interaction data always recorded by service providers are call date and time, originating number, receiving number, type of interaction (call or SMS), length of interaction (in seconds) and the originating/receiving cell tower.\n\nEvery cell tower on earth has a unique location code written in this format: MCC (Mobile Country Code)-MNC (Mobile Network Code)-LAC (Location Area Code)-CellID. Nigeria\u2019s mobile country code is 621, and its 4 largest network providers MTN, Glo, Airtel and 9Mobile have the respective MNCs 30, 50, 20 and 60. Using this information alongside the LAC and CellID provided in the call records below, you can pinpoint the exact cell tower closest to where the call in question was made or received.\n\nFor example, if the given MCC is 621, the MNC is 20 (Airtel), the LAC is 00784, and the CellID is 20565, you can put this information into free public access cell site locators like cell2gps.com and the result will be a cell tower site in Uyo at the junction of Ikot-Ekpene road and Ikpa Road.\n\nThis is actual cell site data from a call made by Frank Akpan at 6.50PM on April 29, 2021\n\nThat being said, it is time to examine the leaked call record data and draw our conclusions. First, here is data I extracted from what my source provided, showing the significant parts of Frank Akpan\u2019s call and SMS history on the day Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nFor ease of understanding, I ran all the numbers through Truecaller and put the names in brackets next to them\n\nAround 1.17PM on April 29, Frank Akpan placed a call to Hiny Umoren, which lasted for 124 seconds. It is fair to extrapolate that this was a call where he gave directions to her regarding where she should go for the purported interview. At 1.21PM, he then placed a call to a Blessing Godwin, which lasted 147 seconds. Was he chatting up another potential victim of the same job interview snare? It is impossible to say for now.\n\nAt 3:38PM, Hiny Umoren then placed a call to Frank Akpan lasting for 106 seconds. If you compare the cell tower data here to that of his previous phone calls, it is clear that he was already at the supposed venue waiting for her because the tower location does not change. It is safe to assume that she was calling to tell him that she had arrived for her interview. Save for a 2-second WhatsApp voice note which Hiny later managed to send to Umoh, this call was probably the last time anyone ever heard Hiny Umoren alive again.\n\nAround 6.15PM, almost 3 hours after Hiny Umoren arrived at his lair, Frank Akpan then placed a call to an unknown number. The call records clearly show +2348127530092 \u2013 Frank Akpan\u2019s known public number \u2013 making repeated contact between 6.15PM and 6.50PM with +2348122386922, an unknown number which brings up no details on Truecaller or Facebook. For reference, if a mobile number pulls up no Truecaller, Facebook or social media results whatsoever, this could either mean that it is used on a non-internet-enabled feature phone (a so-called \u2018burner\u2019 phone), or that the owner is extremely intentional about having no digital footprint linked to that number.\n\nIncidentally, this was also around the time when the Twitter hashtag #FindHinyUmoren had already led Twitter sleuths to uncover Frank Akpan\u2019s identity, leading to his amateur attempt at misdirection referenced earlier. In the middle of a clear and obvious crisis moment, why was Frank Akpan repeatedly trying to establish contact with this unknown number with no digital footprint? The answer could lie in some data I extracted from a different set of call records showing Frank Akpan\u2019s contact with this number in the days and weeks before Hiny Umoren was murdered.\n\nThis unknown person contacted Frank Akpan no fewer than 12 times between April 4 and April 27\n\nWas this a regular buyer or facilitator of whatever gruesome trade Frank Akpan was involved in? Was Frank calling him for help after an unexpected social media campaign suddenly exposed him and put their entire business operation at risk? Why was this the first number that Frank called immediately after raping and murdering a young woman? We do not know the answers to these questions, but there is at least one person other than Frank Akpan himself who can probably tell us.\n\nThe \u201cSenior Forestry Officer\u201d\n\nIt is April 30, 2021, and Frank Akpan has become a nationwide hate figure on social media. His involvement in Hiny Umoren\u2019s disappearance is public knowledge at this point, and time is running out for him. He needs friends and allies to protect him \u2013 and fast. His name and picture are doing the rounds on social media, and in a city like Uyo, it will not be long before someone recognises him and he finds himself subjected to Nigerian street justice.\n\nBetween 10.27Am and 10.44AM, he places 3 phone calls to a Francisca Bassey Akpan \u2013 Francisca is in Calabar when she receives the calls, and she is using a smartphone in a location with high network capacity, which means the network is able to record her location while receiving Frank\u2019s calls to within a few metres of accuracy.\n\nAt 10.55AM, Francisca calls Frank back. Only they and the mobile network know what is said during this 51-second conversation. My source balked at the idea of obtaining customer voice notes because that would simply be a bridge too far, even for the sake of solving a brutal murder. Just getting this much information to me is already breaking multiple in-house rules and NCC codes, so they understandably did not want to push their luck.\n\nAt 4.32PM on April 30, Frank then makes one of the most most interesting phone calls in this entire story. Truecaller pulls up the details of the recipient of the phone call with the number +23480*****326 \u2013 one \u201cKufre Effiong.\u201d Unlike the other people Frank has been known to associate with, Kufre Effiong appears to be from a different world. He is significantly older than Frank and as his location details show, he lives in the swanky part of town. Who is this guy?\n\nTheir conversation lasts for just 31 seconds and presumably ends with Kufre hanging up. Frank\u2019s phone rings almost immediately at 4.34PM. The caller is +234803*****19 and this conversation lasts decidedly longer than the last one \u2013 almost 4 minutes. Who is the owner of this number that has so much to talk about with someone who is probably Nigeria\u2019s most wanted man at the moment? Truecaller answers once again.\n\nKufre Effiong is an older, wealthier looking man who apparently spends his time in the upscale Ewet Estate while Frank Akpan rapes and murders young women in uncompleted buildings somewhere across town.\n\nWhat could these two possibly have in common that brings them together? Interestingly, if you compare the location data from both calls, it is clear that both men have in fact met physically at a certain 58G, Ewet Housing Estate in Uyo. Frank is probably outside the building talking to this older, wiser man on the phone and hoping to get some help from him.\n\nMore on 58G, Ewet Housing Estate later.\n\nWho exactly is Kufre Effiong? I eventually found the answer after scrolling through dozens, maybe hundreds of social media profiles with that exact name. Mr Effiong as it turns out, is something of a big fish in Niger Delta civil service circles.\n\nNow back to the address where both men met. Plot 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is home to the Uyo branch office of a medical NGO called the Center for Clinical Care and Research (CCCR Nigeria).\n\nFounded in 2010 by an all-star list of accomplished Nigerian-American doctors, CCCR carries out medical outreach programs in underserved areas of Nigeria and promotes medical best practices using a fusion of global best practices and local healthcare delivery models. Or at least it used to, because as far as it is possible to tell, its social media pages have had no activity whatsoever since 2017. A scan of news stories since 2017 using the keywords \u201cCCCR Nigeria\u201d and \u201cCenter for Clinical Care and Research Nigeria\u201d turns up nothing.\n\nAnd yet, at least if Google is to be believed, its Uyo branch office at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate still opens at 8.30AM everyday and closes at 5PM. This exact address also happens to be where Kufre Effiong made and received calls from Frank Akpan, who also physically met him there 24 hours after raping and murdering Hiny Umoren.\n\nBlack market value of human organs | Source: Gizmodo\n\nDue to the convoluted house numbering system in Uyo, the property labeled as 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is also recognised on most digital maps as Plot S.9, Unit G, Ewet Housing Estate. That address is also home to Davok Suites, which is a popular upmarket hotel in Uyo favoured by high profile guests including the Cameroon national team.\n\nThis would be the ideal location for a trusted associate of a politician \u2013 say, a senior civil servant \u2013 to lay his head while running a clandestine errand for his boss.\n\nAn errand such as sourcing human parts for use in a ritual sacrifice ahead of the upcoming election season, for example. Whatever it is that happened or is happening at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate \u2013 and for whose benefit \u2013 is a question only Kufre Effiong can answer. Cavernous as this story has become, there is still one more twist.\n\nHiny Umoren\u2019s Murder \u2013 A Police Cover Up In Progress\n\nAt the outset, I referenced a press release from the Akwa Ibom State Command on May 2 patting themselves on the back for arresting Frank Akpan and solving a huge criminal conspiracy in 5 minutes by pinning everything on him. One of the names singled out for praise in the press release for his alleged role in apprehending Frank Akpan was a certain SP Samuel Ezeugo.\n\nOn April 30, at 4.40PM, Frank Akpan placed a call to someone with the number +2348034386086.\n\nSecond from bottom\n\nAt this point, I trust it will not shock you to know that when I ran this number through Truecaller, the name that came up was none other than\u2026\n\nThe one and the same.\n\nIn other words, while the Akwa Ibom Police Command is releasing statements claiming to be solving a crime by arresting a suspect, the suspect was actually making telephone calls to one of the police officers who would later \u201carrest\u201d him, and speaking to him for a minute and a half. What were they talking about? Perhaps Frank Akpan \u2013 who was still at large at the time \u2013 was giving SP Ezeugo instructions for how to apprehend him nicely?\n\nEven more conveniently, Akpan placed the call to SP Ezeugo less than a minute after receiving a text message from Kufre Effiong. While still physically located at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate.\n\nIn other words, the senior civil servant working at the Niger Delta Ministry probably sent SP Ezeugo\u2019s phone number to Akpan via SMS, with instructions to call him and let him \u201chandle\u201d it.\n\nAnd most tellingly of all, SP Ezeugo\u2019s cell tower location data indicates that while all this was happening, he was in close range of a cell tower near the entrance of Ewet Housing Estate. Presumably, on his way to meet oga.\n\nTake note of the cell tower\u2019s location next to General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nFor comparison, look at Ewet Housing Estate vis-a-vis General Edet Akpan Avenue\n\nSo putting the entire picture together, we have what appears to be a well-connected criminal gang in Akwa Ibom with links to the police and the Federal Ministry of the Niger Delta, which probably specialises in sourcing human organs either for the purpose of selling to the international black market or to service local politicians who believe in ritual human sacrifice.\n\nBy the accident of targeting someone with significant social media capital, the existence of this organisation is threatened, and so the Akwa Ibom Police Command is allegedly being used to actively bungle and mishandle the case.\n\nFinding the individual who owns the telephone number +2348*******22 is central to unraveling the mystery of why Iniobong Umoren had to die, how many more like her have died in the past, and most importantly, who are the big fish behind the entire operation. Exactly what is going on at 58, G Unit, Ewet Housing Estate is another key question that must be answered.\n\nIf Frank Akpan won\u2019t talk, maybe Kufre Effiong can tell us.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated in view of fresh facts.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "title": "Isa Ali Pantami \u2013 The Inside Story of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications & Digital Economy",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

          "text": "The possibility of shifting the date for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) is very high, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has said.\n\nJAMB Registrar, Professor Ishaq Oloyede, explained that this was because of the inability of at least 600,000 candidates who have indicated interest to participate, to register for the examination scheduled to hold between June 5 and 19.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual meeting with 2021 UTME committee members on Friday, he disclosed that 1.1 million candidates have so far registered for the 2021 UTME, and the board anticipated approximately 1.9 million registrations at the end of the exercise.\n\nThe JAMB boss noted that while 50 per cent of the candidates have already registered without problem, there was a need to carry everyone along.\n\nHe stated that at the end of the meeting with the stakeholders, they would decide on whether to shift the exam forward or not.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of shifting the exam forward is still high, but that will be determined after our meeting with stakeholders,\u201d said Professor Oloyede.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is because about 600,000 candidates who have indicated interest in the exam are yet to register. There is a need to give everyone the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe examination body, which is responsible for the conduct of the entrance examination into the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions, had directed candidates to provide two pictures in the exam script \u2013 that of who register for the exam and of persons who register for the National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nThe NIN, which is a unique number that identifies individuals, is issued by the country\u2019s National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) upon enrolment.\n\nThe JAMB registrar apologised for the new initiatives introduced in the 2021 UTME, noting that it was not to punish candidates but to expose candidates who engage in the habit of indulging in various forms of malpractices.\n\nWhile calling on the candidates to take note of the process, Professor Oloyede clarified that the essence was to dictate any disparity in the process.\n\n\u201cWe apologise for putting you through some hardship in the registration. The government directed that anyone participating in JAMB must have their NIN. This is beyond our control. Those who are yet to register should do so.\n\n\u201cThe MOCK exam is bill to come up on Thursday. It is an exam meant to test out capability. As you all know, the main exam is coming up on June 5 and 19, 2021,\u201d he told the meeting.\n\nThe JAMB boss added, \u201cWe are meeting with stakeholders today to discuss the issues and on whether we will shift the exam date forward or not. We will brief the media on the outcome of the meeting tomorrow.\n\n\u201cShifting the exam date is not the solution; at the meeting, we will discuss how some of the problems encountered by candidates would be resolved.

          "text": "Greece has officially kicked off its tourist season, lifting most remaining restrictions on movement and declaring \u201cwe are putting the lockdown behind us\u201d.\n\nAlthough an average of 2,000 daily Covid cases are still being reported, vaccinations are being rolled out with the Greek islands as a priority.\n\nA fifth of Greece\u2019s economy is seen as dependent on the tourism sector and 20% of workers are employed by it.\n\n\u201cWe are opening our tourist industry to the world,\u201d Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis announced on Thursday evening in front of the Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion outside Athens.\n\nThe European Union has yet to roll out its cellphone-friendly travel pass system. But southern member-states, driven deeper into debt by the pandemic and highly dependent on tourism revenues, are not waiting.\n\nCroatia has already reopened, as has Cyprus, joined Friday by Greece where residents were allowed to leave home without an electronic permit for the first time in six months.\n\nLast year, the number of visitors to Greece plummeted by 78.2% to 7.4 million \u2014 from a record 34 million in 2019 \u2014 according to official data, with a corresponding drop in tourism revenues.\n\nGreece is hoping to claw back half the 2019 visitor level. It\u2019s vowed to finish vaccinating its entire island population over the next six weeks and will even waive test requirements for tourists who have received vaccines made in Russia and China that are not approved for use domestically.\n\nOther Mediterranean countries are also looking for an edge.\n\nMalta is promising visitors vouchers to go diving and cash rebates to high-end hotel customers.\n\nIn Turkey, visitors from abroad have been exempt from stay-at-home orders applying to Turks, thus enjoying an empty Istanbul, and little-populated beach resorts. Starting Monday, travelers from China, Britain, Australia, and 13 other countries will be allowed in without even having to present a negative COVID-19 test.\n\nItaly is expected to drop a five-day quarantine requirement for travelers from the EU, Britain and Israel this weekend, but many in the hospitality industry are still bracing for another tough year.",
