          "text": "Human rights lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, says northerners have been kicking against Southern governors\u2019 Asaba accord because the north is afraid that the south is now awake and \u201cmay finally attain their independence\u201d.\n\nThe senior advocate made this known in a statement on Monday made available to The PUNCH. The statement was titled, \u2018Why Some Northern Elite Are Suddenly Worried By The Southern Governors \u2018Asaba Declaration?\u2019.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that about 17 southern governors met on Tuesday in Asaba and resolved to ban open grazing and movement of cattle by foot in the region as some kidnappings and killings in the Southern region have been traced to criminal elements amongst herders.\n\nThe governors called for the restructuring of the country along fiscal federalism, devolution of powers and state policing. They also called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to address the nation and convoke a national dialogue to address widespread agitations amongst various groups in the region.\n\nBut the governors\u2019 resolution also known as the Asaba Accord has raised dust, especially in Northern Nigeria, with many critics including Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello; and Senators Ali Ndume from Borno South Senatorial District, amongst others.\n\nReacting in a statement on Monday, Ozekhome stated, \u201cThe sudden unexpected kick by some Northern elite against the patriotic resolutions passed last week at a meeting held in Asaba by the 17 Southern Governors of Nigeria is quite worrisome, but definitely uncalled for. The kick is illegal, unconstitutional and even immoral.\n\n\u201cThe sudden hoopla and ruckus seem to suggest that these few vocal elements are suddenly scared. What are they afraid of? I do not know. Or do you? But, let me do some guess work here. They may probably be afraid that the South has finally woken up and shaken off its Stockholm Syndrome.\n\n\u201cI guess they are scared that the assumed long suffering \u2018slaves\u2019 of Nigeria may finally achieve their overdue liberation, liberty and freedom, and attain their independence from the asphyxiating grip of perpetual overlords, \u2018slave\u2019 masters, neo-Colonialists and territorial expansionists.\n\n\u201cThey may fear that under a true fiscal federation, anchored on the true principles of Federalism, everyone will now be required to contribute to the baking of the national cake and not just merely sharing it.\u201d\n\nOzekhome also slammed the President for jetting to Paris for the African Finance Summit amid the rising insecurity in Nigeria.",

The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States, and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting thanked the Host Governor, His Excellency, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the Southwest Zone to ensure that PDP takes over the majority of the States in the Zone.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "title": "BRAVE ESCAPE FROM BANDITS: I continued driving after being shot in stomach, then I collapsed \u2014 Catholic priest",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nFor many Nigerians in Diaspora, returning to the country to visit their families and friends is far from being an easy decision. There is the initial hesitation that arises from a deep-rooted fear of the unknown.\n\nThe thought of travelling by road from Lagos, Abuja, Kano or Port-Harcourt \u2013 where the major international airports are located \u2013 to the hinterland, no matter how excited the returnee may be, is usually an uncomfortable one. More often than not, they have to decide whether to request escorts to reduce the risk of possible attacks by bandits, or not. Either way, the returnee is likely to feel like a man standing between the devil and the deep blue sea.\n\nThis was the situation 55-year-old Rev. Fr. Aloysius Ezeonyeka, who resides in Los Angeles, US, found himself on December 29, 2020, when he had to visit Nigeria to see his loved ones after spending some years overseas.\n\nTears\n\nEzeonyeka was moved to tears as he recalled the moment when he had to make the tough decision to keep driving the car he picked up from a friend at a Dominican community in Lagos, despite having bullets pelted into his stomach from armed bandits along the Lagos-Benin expressway.\n\nIt was a very harrowing and truly testing moment, one that also awakened his spiritual side.\n\nInitially, he thought the sharp noise he heard was just a pebble propelled loudly from one of his tyres. But in a split second, the origin of that sound was unmistakable. His windscreen shattered as bullets passed by his side, fired by two men hiding in roadside bushes directly in front of him.\n\nAdmitting that it was one of the toughest decisions he ever made in his life, in an interview, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do, but I didn\u2019t have any time to be afraid.\u201d\n\nHe had travelled this road many times as a Benedictine of Ewu Monastery, and he had heard it was now a dangerous stretch of land because of bandits. But he never expected that he would be on the receiving end of violent gunfire.\n\nAlthough unscathed after the first volley of bullets, he knew that the assailants\u2019 intention was to kill him.\n\n\u201cYou might as well at least try a little bit to give them a run for their money,\u201d thought Ezeonyeka.\n\nIn that desperate moment, he found himself faced with three options: he could take the lane further from the shooters, but that would allow more time for them to shoot at him. Or he could take the lane closer to the bush in which they hid, but that would just make his car a closer shot. The third option was to drive towards his attackers.\n\nMaking a life-or-death decision, he pressed himself under the steering column, taking meagre cover under the dashboard as he slammed on the car throttle.\n\nThe assailants ran into the bush to avoid his car and unleashed another barrage. Rounds lodged in a front tyre and around the engine and painfully into Ezeonyeka\u2019s stomach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can have that amount of bullets without being hit. I\u2019m just surprised I was only hit once. I didn\u2019t stop\u201d, he narrated.\n\n\u201cI held the wound as much as I could to keep blood from flowing, but it was practically impossible to do that. I did that the best I could\u201d.\n\nPassed out\n\nAs soon as he was out of range and out of danger, Ezeonyeka knew he would have to pull over before he passed out. At last, he spotted a makeshift truck stop.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I said, \u2018This is where I need to stop,\u2019 the engine died,\u201d the priest recalled.\n\nHe stepped out of the mangled car and then collapsed. But there was no help.\n\nThe trucks he had seen were broken down. Sympathetic people gathered as he lay on the ground, bleeding, for almost an hour.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to do. They had no vehicle. There was no help coming. I kept praying in my heart,\u201d he said.\n\nAt around 6 pm, an 11-year-old boy, identified as God-is-Great, approached. Then, the child ran to his father, who owned a cargo van, shouting that a man was dying and needed help.\n\nThe father, a policeman known as SunnyMopol, fetched his gun because they would have to pass the site of the ambush to reach the nearest clinic. He told his little son to drive, while he literally rode a shotgun.\n\nWith God-is-Great at the wheel, the bandits again emerged from the bush, but Sunny was ready.\n\n\u201cHe started shooting his gun in the air. The bandits thought it was the police and they ran,\u201d Ezeonyeka said.\n\nA young man named Chidiebere, who had joined them, sat in the back of the cargo van with Ezeonyeka and prayed in Igbo. Interspersed in these prayers were appeals for the priest to also pray out loud and to not close his eyes.\n\n\u201cAny time I would try to give up, he would say, \u2018No, no, no, Father, you\u2019ll make it.\u201d\n\nMedical supplies\n\nTogether, they arrived at the first clinic, at 6:30 pm. But the clinic had no medical supplies to handle his case. The hospital staff murmured at the priest\u2019s volatile condition.\n\n\u201c\u2019 Don\u2019t worry about that man, he\u2019s not going to make it. He\u2019s going to die anyway\u2019, so just look at other ones. I could hear them telling the doctor to attend to other patients, that there was no way this man could make it,\u201d Ezeonyeka said.\n\n\u201cI was ready. I had peace with it and told Him (God) that I am really grateful to Him for the amazing life He has given to me. I told Him I was sorry for everything I had done wrong. I handed over my spirit. I was actually a bit curious to see the final act of human dying. I was waiting for it, curious to see how it would happen. It didn\u2019t\u201d.\n\nNext hospital\n\nAfter two hours at the clinic, he was loaded into an ambulance for the trip to the University of Benin City Teaching Hospital.\n\nHe arrived around 10 p.m. Most of the doctors, including all surgeons, had gone home to spend New Year\u2019s Eve with their families. The staff on hand doubted anyone could save him.\n\nAs soon as the local media in Edo got wind of the news, the communications staff of the Catholic Archdiocese of Benin prevailed on journalists not to publish the story until Ezeonyeka was safe. That was when a network of Nigerian priests went into overdrive.\n\nWhen Ezeonyeka\u2019s friends were notified of his plight, they started calling everyone they thought might help, including the Catholic Archbishop of Benin, His Grace Most Revd. Augustine Akubeze, and professors at UNIBEN to which the hospital was connected.\n\nA surgeon returned and determined that a whole team of surgeons would be needed to try to save him. He had lost so much blood that they had to obtain more before proceeding. The five-hour operation began around midnight.\n\n\u201cA few of the doctors felt it was too late, but one or two said they didn\u2019t care, that they were going to go through with the surgery. From then on, it was just an unbelievable array of goodness,\u201d Ezeonyeka said.\n\nThe priest\u2019s brother, Titus, drove three hours from the village to the hospital and collected his brother\u2019s things from SunnyMopol.\n\n\u201cListen. I love you, take care of everyone else. I will see you again,\u201d Ezeonyeka told Titus before being ushered into surgery right around midnight, New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nAfter five hours of unconsciousness, a gentle slapping on his face stirred him, and his eyelids flicked open to a hospital room filled with people clapping and cheering.\n\n\u201cFather, Happy New Year. Welcome to 2021.\u201d Joy flooded the faces of the weary doctors, nurses, friends, and family who surrounded his bed.\n\nThe news of the New Year was not the only surprise awaiting his waking moments. A few days before he left Los Angeles, an old friend had also faced a harrowing ordeal in Owerri. Moses Chikwe, once a fellow Nigerian student priest from Ezeonyeka\u2019s early days in LA (2002), and now an auxiliary bishop in the Diocese of Owerri, had been kidnapped.\n\nThe day after Ezeonyeka was shot, Chikwe was freed, reportedly without ransom. Ezeonyeka would also learn that a Nigerian from California, who had also gone home to Nigeria for holidays, was kidnapped and then murdered, even though his family had paid a ransom.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way you can survive six, seven hours without medication while losing so much blood. That was almost impossibility. They said at that clinic there was no way else I was going to survive. The doctors at the hospital said it was not going to work. I think it was purely providential,\u201d the priest, who has eventually healed and returned to his parish in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in America, said.\n\nEzeonyeka also said he remained grateful for the experience, stressing that it has brought him closer to God and changed his views on life.\n\n\u201cThis is the way I read my own life: God prevented my death because he believed I was not ready. I was not ready for eternity. I was not ready for Heaven. I needed more work for sanctification. I needed to be alive for him to sanctify me and purify me and help me to be ready,\u201d he said.\n\nThe priest further expressed gratitude for the doctors, and to the nurses, who placed his bed in a spot where they could constantly monitor him. He was also grateful to the young man who prayed at his side during the frantic search for medical help, urging him to hang on.\n\nHe admitted being moved by the love of fellow priests who called powerful people late on a holiday night to get him the medical care necessary to save his life.\n\nAs for the bandits who attacked and shot him, he said: \u201cI did pray for these criminals, that God would touch their hearts and change them.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nYoruba won\u2019t play second fiddle\n\nOur irreducible minimum condition of staying in Nigeria is a restructured Nigeria\n\nDayo Johnson \u2013 Akure\n\nThe Pan Yoruba Socio-Political Group Afenifere has lambasted the Senate President Ahmed Lawan for chiding the southern governors on their call for restructuring of the country at their Asaba, Delta state meeting recently.\n\nIts General Secretary, Chief Sola Ebiseni, in a statement said the Senate President has displayed unpardonable ignorance by his submission.\n\n\u201cThe call on the Governors to first ensure restructuring in their States is a display of unpardonable ignorance by the head of the National Assembly, who ought to know that restructuring is not at the act, omission or pleasure of any government or individual State actor, but a holistic overhaul of the structure and character of the State, enshrined in the constitution and binding nilly-willy.\n\n\u201cThe scepticism by the people of the incapacity of the National Assembly to bring about any meaningful restructuring is justified by this expressed mind-set.\n\n\u201cThe sermon of the Senate President chiding the Governors, as elected leaders, not to give voice to these popular views of the people is most mischievous because, in agreement with Governor Okowa of Delta State, the Governors would otherwise have no business staying in office.\n\n\u201cIt is convenient for Senator Lawan to play to the gallery calling for functional Local Government administration, which we agree, but it is also an issue in restructuring which must ensure that justice is equally done to the States, contrary to the nebulous and unjust award of the number of Local Governments, by the military, as presently in the constitution.\n\nThe groups statement was entitled \u201cThe Senate President and other jittery reactions to the southern governors meeting.\n\nIt reads \u201cThe statement credited to the President of the Nigerian Senate, Ahmed Lawan, best summarised some jittery and reactions to the birth of the Southern Governors Forum, their meeting at Asaba and the Resolutions arrived thereat.\n\n\u201cNigeria came into being as an amalgamation of its Southern and Northern Protectorates, each of which is constituted by existing and entrenched ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe North, which is more ethnically heterogeneous and exhibits irreconcilable intolerance among its faiths and even among sects of the same religion, still associates in different fora like a monolithic region.\n\n\u201cThe existence and meeting of the Northern Governors Forum is taken for granted and the Buhari administration especially is pleased to relate with them as such an autonomous holistic region.\n\n\u201cFor instance, at the aftermath of the #endsars# crisis, Northern Nigeria, on November 20, 2020, converged in Kaduna, in a meeting which paraded its 19 Governors and officials of the Federal Government which so shamefully exposed the nepotistic character of the Buhari administration.\n\n\u201cSenate President, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Attorney General of the Federation, Chief of Staff to the President, Inspector General of Police, National Security Adviser etc, all attended the meeting as northerners with the northern traditional rulers in attendance and participated.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government was only forced to hold such meetings in the South but separately on the geopolitical basis of South West, South East and South-South.\n\n\u201cThe Southern Governors Forum is, therefore, a welcome development in engendering a balance of opinion on a two regional basis rather than a cacophony of voices on zonal basis.\n\n\u201cThe southern ethnic nationalities are more agreeable among themselves as religious crisis is completely non-existent, neither are there inter-ethnic territorial contests or the fear of territorial ambition by any ethnic nationality to possess the land and dominate any other group.\n\n\u201cThe South is completely united in the quest for restructuring of the federation, devolution of powers to the constituent states of the federation; they all suffer from insecurity imposed on their people by ethnic Fulani terrorists herdsmen and related kidnapping and armed banditry.\n\n\u201cIt is so embarrassing and most unfortunate that under General Muhammadu Buhari, armed ethnic militias in the guise of herding animals would attack, sack and occupy communities while the people are relocated to IDP camps.\n\n\u201cThe Southern Governors Forum is the logical response to the need for a common platform for unity of purpose for development and fight against insecurity and all forms of criminality.\n\n\u201cThe same powers exercisable by some northern states banning trading in alcohol and destroying such wares in hundreds of Millions of Naira, belonging mainly to southerners, is not different from same by Southern or any state regulating the business of animal husbandry necessitating the ban of open grazing and transporting animals by foot.\n\n\u201cThe other Resolutions contained in the communique are equally national and most patriotic in their concept and applicability as panacea for peaceful coexistence and development of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEvery issue raised in the communique, as indices of a true federal State, which include State Police, devolution of powers to the federating states, review of the revenue formula, reflection of the Federal character in appointments including at the commanding heights of the economy and national security, are what we, in the Afenifere, have placed on the front page of national discourse, particularly since the return to democratic rule and also fully embraced by other patriotic organisations including the Southern and Middle Belt Forum.\n\n\u201cThey are contained in the reports of the 2014 National Conference already in the custody of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThose who interpret any call for restructuring as secessionist agitations need be told that Nigeria can only move forward by negotiations on terms reasonably agreeable to its stakeholders.\n\n\u201cTo us, in the Afenifere, and as stated in the inaugural address of our Acting Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, on Friday 14th May 2021, our consistent advocacy for the restructuring of the country to federalism is based on our founding philosophy.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba people are the only ethnic group that has never called for secession.\n\n\u201cWe will be in Nigeria as equal partners in a federal Nigeria. A Nigeria in which we will play a second fiddle is most unacceptable.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our irreducible minimum condition of staying in Nigeria is a restructured Nigeria. Anything short of that is \u2018\u2018to thy tent, oh Isreal.\u201d\n\nAfenifere concluded by saying that \u201cThe unity of horse and the rider in which a section of the country is the rider and we the horse is most unacceptable.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "The wife of Enugu State Governor, Mrs. Monica Ugochi Ugwuanyi, has tasked mothers to always ensure they take proper record of their children\u2019s immunization, for effective administration of vaccines on them for healthy living.\n\nMrs. Ugwuanyi gave the advice during the flag off of the 2021 Maternal, New Born and Child Health Week (MNCHW) and Modified Integrated Medical Outreach Programme (MIMOP), held on Monday, at Uwani Health Centre, Enugu South Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Enugu First Lady noted that some mothers do forget the scheduled date for immunization of their children, stressing that proper record keeping is essential and a sure way to effectively immunize the kids.\n\n\u201cOne advice I want to give is this; let\u2019s have a small bag where you keep your children\u2019s cards. You will also put in the bag everything concerning the child that you need in the hospital so that even when you are not there, the person taking the child to the hospital can pick the bag and present the necessary records for urgent medical attention.\n\n\u201cImmediately you get to the hospital, you give them the card so that they know the child\u2019s immunization history, because they will ask questions, such as how many immunizations he or she has taken, among others. So let\u2019s try to update our children\u2019s immunization card\u201d.\n\nReiterating her call for strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocol, Mrs. Ugwuanyi urged residents of Enugu State to continue to wear their facemasks, wash their hands with soap and running water, maintain social distancing, among other precautionary measures.\n\nIn his speech, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Ikechukwu Obi, who expressed delight at the state government\u2019s commitment to MNCHW, said the programme offers great opportunity for women and children to have access to unique healthcare services at the primary level.\n\nThe Health Commissioner advised fathers to mobilize their wives to take advantage of the one week programme to access quality healthcare services \u201cthat will enable them to breed healthy children that can take after us\u201d.\n\nHe commended Mrs. Ugwuanyi\u2019s pet project, Ugo\u2019s Touch of Life Foundation (U-TOLF) for facilitating the receipt of vaccines and other medicines for the immunization.\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Secretary of Enugu State Primary Health Care Development Agency (ENS-PHCDA), Dr. George Ugwu, disclosed that the administration of Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is focusing special attention on primary healthcare services across the state.\n\nDr. Ugwu pointed out that \u201cOur healthcare-friendly Governor of Enugu State, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has given the agency the mandate to work hard and ensure that the healthcare development services for the rural and ordinary citizens of this state are improved\u201d.\n\nThe Executive Secretary highlighted that the Ugwuanyi administration has been providing critical infrastructure, constructing and renovating health centres, stressing that \u201cit is only in Enugu State that you talk about Type 3 Primary Healthcare Centre, a special primary healthcare centre that is above the expected level\u201d.\n\nHis words: \u201cApart from these infrastructural developments, our governor is also concentrating in ensuring that our women and children are getting the services they deserve; the services that prevent them from falling sick by providing them with immunization and nutritional services, family planning and all other things women and children need\u201d.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Chairman of Enugu South LGA, Hon. Monday Eneh, represented by his deputy, Hon. Sandra Onyia, the Chairman of Enugu State Traditional Rulers\u2019 Council, HRH Igwe Amb. Lawrence Agubuzu, representative of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Ogechi Akalonu, the UNICEF representative, Dr. Nwakaego Ibekwe, and others, applauded Gov. Ugwuanyi and his wife, Monica for their passion and outstanding contributions towards quality and affordable healthcare service delivery across the state in spite of the nation\u2019s economic, security and public health challenges.\n\nThey maintained that flag off of the immunization programme was among the concerted efforts of the state government to effectively guarantee the health and wellbeing of mothers and children in Enugu State.\n\nThe stakeholders therefore enjoined mothers in every part of the state to avail themselves of this one-week opportunity by immunizing their children.\n\nOther dignitaries at the event include the Executive Secretary, Enugu State Agency for Controls of AIDS (ENSACA), Dr. Arthur Idoko and the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Dr. Ifeanyi Agujiobi.",

          "text": "By Tony Akowe and Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nNigeria would need a whopping 2 billion dollars (about N826 billion) annually to fund its Armed Forces to effectively combat the daunting challenges of insecurity it presently faces, the Defence Headquarters said in Abuja on Monday.\n\nThis disclosure came to the fore on Monday just it was revealed that some members of the Armed Forces currently engaged in the fight against insurgency and other criminal act are lobbying to be redeployed from the area where they are posted as a result of poor welfare.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on a bill to establish a the Armed Forces Special Trust Fund organized by the House of Representatives Committee on Defence, Director of Production, Defence Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal M. A. Yakubu, who spoke at a public hearing on the Armed Forces Support Trust Fund Bill organized by the House of Representatives Committee on Defence said even the sources of funding specified in the Bill would be inadequate to tackle the problem.\n\nThe Bill seeks alternative sources of funding for the Armed Forces to improve the software, hardware and training.\n\nYakubu said the projection for funding in the Bill is estimated at about N100 billion per year.\n\nWhen established, the Support Trust Fund is expected to draw funds from one percent of the total money accruing to the Federation Account; 0.5 percent of the profit made from the investment of the National Sovereign Wealth Fund (NSWF) by the Nigerian Sovereign Investment, one percent of Value Added Tax (VAT) remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) as well as any take-off grant and special intervention fund as may be provided by the Federal Government, states and local governments of the Federation.\n\nIt will also draw funds from one percent of the air ticket contract, charter and cargo sales charge to be collected by the airlines and paid to the support fund; Aids, grant and all assistance from international agencies, nongovernmental organizations and the private sectors; and Money derived from investments made by the Support Fund.\n\nBut AVM Yakubu said this will still be inadequate, saying \u201cI have been a defence attach\u00e9 in the United States of America from 2014 to 2017. I have been a Director of Procurement at the headquarters of the Nigerian Airforce for another two years.\n\n\u201cI have been a chief of logistics also at the headquarters Nigerian Airforce for another two years. So I am fully conversant with what it takes to run the affairs of a fighting Airforce.\n\n\u201cI also understand the limitations we have in Nigeria and what it should have been. I want you to understand how large is this problem we are trying to address before I make my point.\n\nIn his presentation, Director General Defence Research and Development Bureau, Air Vice Marshall U. P. Uzezi, urged that research and development be taken more seriously so that required military hardware can be produced locally.\n\nHis words, \u201cThis bill is needed at this point in time in the history of our country, bearing in mind the national security challenges we are facing. I just want to raise two points on this draft.\n\n\u201cThe bill talks about local production and I was thinking to myself how we are going to achieve this local production without adequate research being done to encourage local production. I did not find one. Of course it is implied in the bill, but not explicitly capture. I thought that R and D should be included as one of these priorities in this Bill.\n\n\u201cThere are many research institutes in the country, but they have suffered and they have not been able to achieve much because of this singular act of inadequate funding\u201d\n\nA member of the House of Representatives Committee on Defence, Hon Princess Miriam Odinaka Ohuoha, urged that the Bill should also accommodate better welfare for men and officers of the Armed Forces.\n\nShe said her constituents who are in the frontlines have been calling her to help them get deployed because of the issue of their welfare.\n\nShe said \u201cdoes the trust fund take care of the welfare of men and officers of the Armed Force? I am aware that in most cases, people in the front line are begging to be redeployed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs a representative of the people, I have a countless number of my constituents who call and write to me and say they have been posted to so and so place and have been there for long and that I should use my good office to apply for them to be redeployed.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about the zeal to serve your country. But the fear of what happens to your family when you die even in the line of duty. How can we tinker with the bill to at least accommodate the welfare of these people,\u201d she said.",

It is a political strategy to control the people.\n\n\u201cBut when they are sharing money, there is no tribe or religion; they are sharing it behind. So wake up.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum in Nigeria rose from a one-day consultative meeting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Monday, and called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately send an Executive Bill to the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe governors noted that the amendment of the constitution should be done such that more powers would be devolved to the states with respect to security arrangements that would culminate in state policing and the general security architecture.\n\nTwelves governors among 15 elected on the PDP platform and one deputy governor held the meeting at the Conference Centre of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan.\n\nA six-point communique issued at the end of the meeting and read by the Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, further reviewed the state of the nation, particularly practical next steps to take to advance the conversation on the worsening security situation and collapsing economy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe communique read in part: \u2018In the interim, Mr President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr President and all State Governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing.\n\n\u2018The meeting agreed that the Police Force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u2018The meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages. To this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC Government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\n\n\u2018The meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u2019\n\nThe meeting also thanked Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State \u2018for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South West Zone to ensure that PDP takes over majority of the States in the Zone.\u2019\n\nApart from Makinde and Tambuwal, the PDP governors that are also in attendance are the vice chairman of the forum and Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu; Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Duoye For (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Godwin Onadeko (Edo), and Nyesom Wike (Rivers). Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State was represented by his deputy, Mahdi Mohd.\n\nThe governors that were not at the meeting are Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku, and Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade.",

The era of centralized policing should be done away with while locals and communities be allowed to own and operate arms carrying personal to protect the huge investments in the oil and gas sector,\u2019\u2019.\n\nPENGASSAN also called on investors and management in the oil and gas to disregard the effects of COVID-19 pandemic in the sector and safe guide the workers in the industry against COVID-19 instigated redundancies, wage reduction and arbitrary dismissal.\n\nRather, PENGASSAN said encouragement should focused on opening new frontiers that will harness the abundant natural gas resources in the Zone, the ninth-largest in terms of global gas reserves with over 200 Trillion Cubic Feet(TCF), as well as the establishment of modular refineries and training facilities for the youth in the oil bearing communities as a way to fighting the rising wave of criminality and other social vices.",

          "title": "DHQ: Proposed N100bn Armed Forces Support Trust Fund Inadequate to Address Insecurity",
          "text": "By Udora Orizu\n\nThe Defence Headquarters on Monday said the N100 billion proposed by the Armed Forces Support Trust Fund Bill will be inadequate to combat the worsening insecurity bedevilling the country.\n\nSpeaking at the Bill\u2019s public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Defence, the Director of Production, Defence Headquarters, Air Vice Marshall M. A. Yakubu, said with the fluctuating exchange rate, sometimes it is impossible to fund procurement of equipment already signed for, making them run back to the federal government for interventions.\n\nHe said the United States will not sell equipment without a support package for a minimum of three years.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dThere must be training and other things. That total package came to that amount. How many years would it take you to budget. The maximum we have received from 2017 to date we have received in capital allocation for the Air Force was about N44 billion per annum. Convert that at the current exchange rate. How many years do you need to gather $500 million to buy just 12 aircraft? Look at the expanse of land we are required to cover? Nigeria is over 920,000 square km. Every inch of the land needs to be covered by either surveillance or capability to attack.\n\n\u201dAbout two weeks ago, we had a brief discussion of what we intend to generate from this. We are estimating something in the range of N100 billion per annum. Convert that to dollars because virtually all the equipment are imported. This will go nowhere. And it would not address the problem we are seeking to address unless we expand the sources. Nobody wants to sleep with only one eye closed. Everybody is scared of traveling on the road because of insecurity. Therefore I would urge that all stakeholders must educate citizens to understand the need to sacrifice because if we do not do that to address this problem sincerely speaking would continue to be a mirage.\u201d\n\nHe further called for the raising of the percentage of various areas that are expected to fund the trust fund.\n\n\u201cIf we are not able to raise a minimum of $2 billion per annum in the next three years for a start, subsequently maybe we can begin to taper down the percentages. But for a start we need a bulk sum because of many of these manufacturers of equipment require 100 per cent down payment to even start production. So you cannot sign a contract example with the US manufacturers and pay 15 per cent mobilization as required by the Procurement Act. Nobody would look at you. Their terms must be followed. Many times we are asked to pay 100 per cent,\u201d he added\n\nAlso, the Director General, Defence Research and Development Bureau, Air Vice Marshall U. P. Uzezi, canvassed that research and development be taken more seriously, so that the required military hardware can be produced locally.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis bill is very needed at this point in time in the history of our country, bearing in mind the national security challenges we are facing. I was thinking to myself how are we going to achieve this local production without adequate research that is being done to encourage local production. I did not find one. Of course it is implied in the bill but not explicitly captured. I thought that R and D should be included as one of the priorities in this Bill. Explicitly captured.\n\n\u201cThere are many research institutes but they have suffered and they have been able to achieve a lot because of this singular act of inadequate funding. I believe that the bills when passed into law would support the bill that is coming forth for the defence, research and development, which I also think is a good thing. I want to plead with the committee to include particularly in the establishment of the fund under the utilization of the fund section 3, that R and D be captured.\u201d\n\nResponding to the stakeholders\u2019 inputs, the Chairman of the Committee and the Bill\u2019s sponsor, Hon. Babajimi Benson, assured the audience that going forward, all concerns raised will be addressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Insecurity: Only 9% of Military Budget Goes to Capital Purchases, Says Gbajabiamila",
          "text": "\u2022 House to hold 5-day security summit next week\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, on Monday said that based on appropriation records, about 91 per cent of current funding to the Armed Forces go on recurrent overhead, salaries and welfare, leaving only nine per cent for capital purchases.\n\nThis is as he said that the country is at war against insurgency, terrorism, kidnapping and all manner of insecurity; hence the need to uplift the resources available to the Armed Forces to enable them procure the best tools to help win the war.\n\nThe Speaker also disclosed that the House will next week host a five-day special summit on national security, to take an all-nation and all-government approach by examining extensively non-military solutions to insecurity.\n\nGbajabiamila stated these while delivering his keynote address in Abuja at a one-day public hearing on the Armed Forces Support Trust Fund Establishment Bill 2021.\n\nThe House had, on February 27, 2020, moved to address the funding needs of the Armed Forces by passing for second reading a Bill to create a special support fund for the Armed Forces of the federation.\n\nThe Speaker, who was represented by the House Leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa, said these realities prompted the lawmakers to seek a way of providing funds that will be focused on the capital needs and training of the Armed Forces.\n\nGbajabiamila said that Nigeria\u2019s expenditure on military hardware and training in the last five years hovers between a paltry nine to 11 per cent of the total annual budgetary allocation to the Armed Forces.\n\nThis, he said, is grossly incapable of empowering the military to face the security challenges in the country especially the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe stressed that if Nigeria must develop, then there\u2019s need to get the security estate right by ensuring that the military is adequately equipped and well trained.\n\nHe said the importance of the proposed legislation is evidenced by the dwindling resources available to the Armed Forces of Nigeria to prosecute the various security operations it is involved in, which requires innovative ideas to raise additional funds without placing any burden on Nigerians,\n\nin support of the Nigerian military.\n\nGbajabiamila said: \u201dThe solution to our security challenges requires asymmetric actions across many policy areas. To succeed in this fight, the Armed Forces of Nigeria requires more funding for modern weapons and required trainings. Spending on military hardware must definitely increase to support the zeal and commitment already being exhibited by our soldiers. The Armed Forces Support Trust Fund (Establishment) Bill, 2021 is a time limited endeavour to upgrade the equipment infrastructure of the Armed Forces in a deliberate manner that will better position them to be more effective in securing the nation.\n\n\u201dThe myriad of security challenges facing the country has continued to dwarf every developmental effort put in by the government. No nation develops in a state of insecurity as currently being witnessed in Nigeria. This Bill has been crafted in ways that does not impose any direct additional burden on Nigerian citizens and businesses, but creatively make funds available through deductions from statutory receipts of the federal government as well as voluntary donations. I am happy to support this Bill because it will help reposition our military capabilities in ways that can only strengthen our national security. I agree that the solutions to our insecurity as a nation will not only be by military powers alone; but also, by non-military engagement and development of our communities.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Bill\u2019s sponsor and Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson, said the need for additional sources of funding for the Armed Forces became more apparent considering the myriad of security challenges facing the country.\n\nBenson explained that currently, the Armed Forces receive its funding mainly through the annual appropriations made by the National Assembly, and in recent times has continued to expand both in terms of personnel and the provision of platforms, weaponry and equipment to sustain its ever increasing operations.\n\nHe lamented that efforts in the past by the Armed Forces to procure the needed military hardware and provide requisite training to meet the challenges currently being faced has hit the brick wall due to limited financial resources.\n\nMaking reference to other countries such as United Kingdom, Russia, United States of America, the chairman said globally, no country adequately finances its Armed Forces solely through annual budgetary allocations and Nigeria ranks very low on the global defence spending, occupying fourth position in Africa, below Algeria, Morocco and South Africa despite its numerous security challenges.\n\nHe said when the Bill becomes law, the Armed Forces is expected to have additional resources for its use.\n\nHe assured his audience that the Bill has been designed in such a way that there will be no new direct financial burden on any Nigerian or businesses, adding that it is only appropriate for Nigerians to expect better outcomes and improved oversight by the House.\n\nBenson said: \u201dIn 2020, while Nigeria spent only $2.6 billion on its military, Algeria, Morocco and South Africa expended $9.7 billion, $4.8 billion and $3.1 billion respectively to fund and equip their military. Coping with the modern security challenges being faced in Nigeria today is, no doubt, an enormous task that requires contemporary, robust, weII-trained, well-equipped and efficient Armed Forces. The revenue sources are mostly statutory deductions as well as voluntary donations.\n\n\u201dAs your representatives, we are sensitive to the hardship in the land. We are also aware of the resultant backlash from the public on our military as a result of failure to effectively address the prevailing security challenges. No doubt, this bill will place even more burden of social accountability and trust on the Armed Forces of Nigeria. While that is understandable and expected, this is the time for citizens to rally behind our military. They need all the support they can garner to effectively tackle these challenges and ensure the protection of lives and property of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "A Product Marketing Manager\u2019s guide to killing it on the job",
          "text": "I\u2019m bringing Feranmi Ajetomobi to Centre Stage because I admire how he expertly combines analytical thinking and empathetic storytelling to help Cowrywise achieve its goals. He certainly has a unique approach to growth and leadership\u2013 an approach that is useful to aspiring product marketers.\n\n\u201cSo, what does the day-to-day of a product marketing lead look like?\u201d\n\nMy conversation with Feranmi Ajetomobi begins with this seemingly simple question. In the background, coffee cups clink, plates rattle, and waiters call out orders in strained voices.\n\nFeranmi leads product marketing at Cowrywise; a wealthtech and personal finance startup founded by Razaq Ahmed and Edward Popoola in 2017.\n\nFeranmi: If you asked me this question two years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have known how to answer. [laughs].\n\n\u201cWhat has changed since then\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I started off in Cowrywise as a social media handler. Then I moved on to become the Brand Storyteller before settling into my current role as Product Marketing Manager.\n\n\u201cHave you always been about growth and numbers? How did you transition from being a social media handler to product marketing?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: From the get-go, I had always been focused on ensuring that whatever we did positively impacted our bottom line. I\u2019m interested in engaging customers and keeping them connected to our brand. An engaged customer will always spread the word about your product.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to running campaigns, what should people in your field keep in mind?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: [laughs] This is a dicey question because campaigns have different objectives depending on the marketing team\u2019s goals. But I\u2019ll stress the importance of keeping what you want to measure in front of you. It doesn\u2019t make sense to run one campaign with multiple goals at the same time. I recommend starting with one goal and working to tie it to the bottom line. A bonus answer is: implement fast.\n\nI might need to re-think the number of goals I added to a campaign document I worked on last week.\n\nFeranmi: You definitely should. The truth is, focusing on one goal allows you to under-promise and over-deliver.\n\nCustomers love when brands exceed their expectations. You cannot exceed a customer\u2019s expectations if you are juggling too many goals.\n\nFeranmi: Exactly. One goal keeps your customers excited about what you are building to meet their needs.\n\nStudying Economics, writing classes, and a toolbox full of skills\n\n\u201cWhat skills did you already have in your toolbox and how did they help you become successful at your role in Cowrywise\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I took creative writing and poetry classes when I was in primary school. Interestingly enough, I grew up wanting to be a doctor but ended up studying economics at university.\n\n\u201cSay, what?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: [laughs] It\u2019s a long story that involves writing JAMB, applying for pharmacology, not getting in, re-writing JAMB, dropping out of some pre-med courses because of a problematic lecturer and re-routing to economics.\n\nStudying economics helped me think analytically about numbers and growth. My writing and comprehension skills enable me to break down complicated financial jargon into easy-to-understand articles.\n\n\u201cFascinating. What skills have you learned on the job\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Learning how to write emails in HTML and deepening my understanding on website and product analytics.\n\nThe subtle art of asking questions, listening and paying attention to small details\n\n\u201cWhat motivates you to stick with a company\u201d\n\nFeranmi: A strong and supportive team is a big motivator for me. Not a lot of founders will risk hiring someone who doesn\u2019t have a suite of impressive skills from the jump. Cowrywise is a space where I can learn and grow within my role and the company. I\u2019m also motivated by the company\u2019s vision. Cowrywise is interested in providing investment and wealth creation opportunities to Africans wherever they are in the world.\n\n\u201cWhat would you say to aspiring product marketing professionals\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Successful product marketing managers must have sharp social listening skills. You need to be able to gather information about how people interact with your products and brand. Next, you need to be intelligent about the way you see and address your competition.\n\n\u201cWhat makes someone a great leader?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I don\u2019t send angry emails during a heated moment. I may write my thoughts out and save them in my drafts, but I\u2019m unlikely to send angry emails to my team members. I ask questions before I make assumptions about delayed work or missed deadlines. Being a good listener is a non-negotiable leadership skill. Listen and pay attention to your team members\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. Where do your team members like to eat? Can you tell when they are having a bad day? How quick are you to offer them support? Ask questions, listen, and pay attention to the little details.\n\nWomen, financial exclusion, and the future of wealthtech\n\n\u201cWhat have you discovered about financial exclusion where women are concerned?\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Firstly, let me say that financial businesses that aren\u2019t chasing the inclusion of women are sleeping on a horse. Secondly, a lot of Nigerian women are victims of financial abuse in their own homes. Women who live in rural areas can\u2019t even access the money they earn from working petty jobs. Finally, the road to accessing credit in the informal sector is a long and bumpy one; particularly for women.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of recommendations would you make to conventional banking executives\u201d\n\nFeranmi: Most of these women have feature phones but they aren\u2019t literate enough to navigate USSD prompts. I recommend that banks and financial institutions use robocalls to communicate with women in rural communities. They can take it a step further by providing instructions on how to access credit in their local languages or dialect.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is the future of wealthtech in Africa? What do you think is possible\u201d\n\nFeranmi: I wake up every day thinking about endless possibilities in this industry. Wealthtech companies are going to help future billionaires grow their money. There\u2019s a common myth that wealthtech products help people make money \u2013 that\u2019s not what we do. We help you grow the money you make, legally. Adoption is moving at a snail pace but with consistent financial education, we\u2019re going to see more Africans gravitate towards wealth management services. I\u2019m hoping that more Nigerian wealthtech companies will invest in creating resources and content to promote financial wellness.",

          "text": "\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t come out right, they blame the editors.\u201d\n\nChuks Oteke had had enough of the complaints about his work. In 2012, he set up his video production studio where he provided visual effects and video editing services, but every now and then he received complaints from clients who were dissatisfied with his work. To them, Oteke was the problem but to him, the problem was the raw video cuts he got from his clients.\n\nThe shots taken on set didn\u2019t really tell the story and the clients believed that any shortcoming could be fixed in post-production.\n\nWhen he couldn\u2019t take it anymore he decided to look into why the shots were poor. He took on different camera operator jobs on different video shoot sets. At the end of his research, he came to the conclusion that the camera operators didn\u2019t have the right tools to get the right shots.\n\n\u201cTo tell a good story, it\u2019s not just about the camera. You need to position the lighting right, you also need to frame the shots appropriately. If a character is feeling depressed, the camera angle should help depict depression. High angles help with this by making the actor seem small or overwhelmed. On the contrary, a low angle helps in depicting joy or happiness,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some cases, a crane is needed to achieve these shots but how many people can afford it?\n\nThis informed his decision to go into creating tools for shooting videos. He started with making prototypes of DIY tools. It didn\u2019t officially become a business until some people offered to pay him for the tools.\n\n\u201cSo I started making noise on Instagram and Facebook about how I make customised DIY tools and the response was good. It got to a point where there was so much demand I just couldn\u2019t meet up with it.\u201d\n\nThis birthed Film Anatomie, one of the few African companies designing and manufacturing filming equipment. It caters for a wide range of clients such as independent content creators, filmmakers, television studios and even equipment rental companies.\n\nA component of the slider created by Film Anatomie\n\nGetting into General Electric (GE) Garage\n\nHigh demand could have fooled someone else to think they were in business but not Oteke. He quickly realised that he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable enough to turn his interest into a business so he enrolled in the General Electric (GE) Garage Program in 2014. During the training program, which spanned across a few years, his mind was opened to advanced manufacturing techniques, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc.\n\nHe remarked that simply learning about product design influenced the design of his products.\n\nDuring the program, Oteke met other participants who were into robotics, aviation, STEM education and biomedicine.\n\nAt the end, he had access to over a thousand local and foreign mentors in the tech space.\n\n\u201cI now had this network of people I can contact at any time and say, \u2018I have this problem, how can I solve it?\u2019 Definitely, there\u2019ll be somebody who knows somebody else who can help.\u201d\n\nDifficulty in getting funding\n\nArmed with this knowledge and network, he set out to run a better business. He knew where and how to get raw materials. It wasn\u2019t possible to make everything locally but with 80% local raw materials the cost of production was low.\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle was finance. He needed a business partner as well as capital.\n\n\u201cI am a techie. I\u2019m not a business person. So I was looking for investors who\u2019d provide capital and also business advice. It took a while for me; other participants had already gotten investments.\u201d\n\nGraduates of the GE Garage Program were introduced to a pool of investors in their fields. While many of the other participants had business ideas that were seen as important, Oteke\u2019s idea was seen as a nice-to-have. Investors showed little to no interest in him until the movie Lionheart was released.\n\nHow Lionheart changed everything\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know Genevieve, I\u2019ve never met her, but she doesn\u2019t know what she has done for me.\u201d\n\nGenevieve Nnaji\u2019s Lionheart made headlines in 2018 for its milestone as a pioneering Nigerian Netflix original. Finally, investors started paying attention to the creative industry. Oteke started getting some attention.\n\nIn an industry that barely has ready data, Oteke had to crowdsource and develop a realistic projection for his business. He found out that the Nigerian movie industry produces about 50 movies per week and generates an impressive $590million in revenue annually.\n\nHis pitch to investors was simple: the filming industry market is smaller than it will be in a few years time, it\u2019s easier to gain a large market share now.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s creative industry doesn\u2019t have a repository but with Netflix you could see the views and how much was being paid. Lionheart was reportedly bought for $3.8m.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, while it was easier to get overall industry statistics, he still had issues getting numbers because his target audience are moviemakers, not actors. He reached out to different production teams to get a sense of how much they spent on equipment and what the demand was like.\n\n\u201cI reached out to friends in film production and film schools. I established a relationship with Dell York, Jeta Amata and Olu Jacobs\u2019 film school. I\u2019m trying to establish one with Ebony life. We hope to grow to the point where you can come to us when you need the numbers for Africa\u2019s creative industry.\u201d\n\nA member of Film Anatomie working on a new product\n\nGetting Investment\n\nAfter one of Oteke\u2019s pitches at GE garage, an investor from Platform capital* reached out to him. The conversation, unlike others, looked promising.\n\n\u201cI remember I told him \u2018I\u2019m not really much of a business person, and I know you can help. You also have access to other markets like Asia, America and the UK\u2019. He was quite open and he wanted to build a film academy, a production company, and [had] a lot of other creative ideas.\u201d\n\nOteke finally got investment just before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic made it difficult to get a few necessary things but was also a blessing because at that time they pivoted to making face masks with their 3D printers. It was a business opportunity that kept the lights on for a while before they returned back to their main focus: creating film equipment.\n\nA sample of the Face Mask made with 3D printer\n\nOteke and some team members at work\n\nOffering free products to get customers\n\nAs the effects of the pandemic waned and filming activities began, Oteke and his team were tasked with finding customers. Unlike other popular filming equipment, people were hesitant towards trusting their expensive cameras and filming gadgets with less popular locally made equipment. Building trust was the next hurdle they had to jump.\n\n\u201cWe found a way to mitigate that problem by offering our products for free. We targeted selected customers who could help us publicize our brand. For instance, I took my slider to where some big filmmakers were filming.

          "text": "Technology-enabled solutions are increasingly becoming part of everyday life in Nigeria, helped by a combination of a largely young and tech-savvy population, deepening broadband penetration, and widespread mobile connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic has only further accelerated the transition to digitally-enabled lifestyles with more and more Nigerians adopting technology to live a simpler life.\n\nWhile this growing digital culture permeates all aspects of life, from the way we work, shop, commute, and even entertain ourselves, financial services in the country are still provided largely via manual processes, and many Nigerians are subject to several restrictions that come with the existing banking system. The spending limits on bank-issued naira-denominated debit cards Nigerians use for dollar payments readily comes to mind. Also, there is a significant number of adults that remain outside of the financial inclusion umbrella due to the limitations of the existing banking system and thus lack access to basic financial services.\n\nThe rising digital culture and unmet consumer demand require service providers that understand current trends and can leverage technology to meet the financial inclusion and changing lifestyle needs. One such is Fundall, a Nigeria-based digital banking platform that seeks to solve the accessibility problem while offering users a more convenient full-banking experience compared to traditional banks. Fundall prides itself on helping their users achieve optimal financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWe understand that people only want to keep up with 8 to 10 apps on their phone; with social networking and entertainment apps making up more than half of that number. We believe there is a growing desire for one platform to handle all things money and that is what we strive to become by providing individuals and businesses with financial products and services that help them better manage how they spend, manage and grow money.\u201d \u2013 Ayomide Ajayi, Growth Lead at Fundall\n\nOfficially launched in 2020 with a microfinance banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria, Fundall is a digital bank that provides wholesome financial products and services to individual Nigerians and businesses through a single platform.\n\nToday, Fundall announces their launch of USD virtual cards to their existing and prospective users. Fundall\u2019s dollar virtual cards aims to eliminate the challenge of spending limits Nigerians come across when making international payments using naira cards. The USD-denominated debit card is a limitless passport to the world as users are able to enjoy freedom and flexibility when making payments in dollars anywhere in the world.\n\nWith a Fundall virtual dollar card, users can spend internationally and transact on any website seamlessly as well as enjoy the convenience, flexibility, safety, and security of cashless payments across various channels \u2013 whether for shopping online on Shopify or Amazon, paying for streaming access on Netflix, or business services like Facebook Ads.\n\nFundall users will be able to get their first virtual dollar card for free, while the creation fee for subsequent card creation is just $2. Users are also able to create multiple cards instantly and can easily dedicate each card to one web platform.\n\nFundall \u2013 run by a company of the same name founded in 2019 \u2013 is on a mission to provide all things money in one place to their customers. Fundall users can manage everything money-related on its online platform; and unlike most banking services providers that only focus on the money of their clients, Fundall does more to help its growing user base. There are currently 17,000 individuals and 150 businesses registered on Fundall\u2019s online platform right now.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foremost financial super app offers a wide range of services that include flexible payments and transfers, savings plans, in addition to advanced tools for better money management such as lifestyle cards, budget planning, income and spending analytics, SaveAsYou Spend, Portfolio Line of Credit, and insurance.

A savings tool and wealth builder aimed towards specific goals are included. Users can split bills, make utility payments, as well as send and receive money in the Fundall network and with other local banks.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Telda, an Egyptian fintech startup, has raised $5 million in a pre-seed round to digitise how Egyptians save, spend, and send money. The round was led by US VC firm, Sequoia Capital; Berlin-based Global Founders Capital (GFC); and Class 5 Global.\n\nThis pre-seed round led by Sequoia Capital is the largest in Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Also, it is Sequoia Capital\u2019s first investment in MENA, while Telda is the first digital bank in Egypt.\n\nThe fintech \u2014 with a goal to change how Gen Z in the Middle East spends their money \u2014 allows users to sign up for a digital account that comes with a free Mastercard-powered card that can be used for online payments, in-store purchases, and cash withdrawal.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Ahmed Sabbah, Telda CEO, said that more than 30,000 people had signed up, with half of them demanding cards. Therefore, with the new funding, Telda aims to accelerate its card production and dispensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the launch of the money app, Sabbah was the Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Egyptian transportation startup, Swvl.

          "text": "Leading crypto exchange platform, Binance, has reported a surge in the number of African users on its platform. This is despite attempts by some governments across the continent to clamp down on the use of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt saw an increase of 2228.21% in P2P users on the platform and 386.93% in P2P volumes across Africa.\n\nRecall that in February, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a circular prohibiting banks and financial institutions from facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges. This followed a trend of governments worldwide pushing back on the use of cryptocurrencies, with United States Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, expressing reservations about the volatility of cryptocurrencies and their role in criminal activities.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the number of users on Binance that increased. The trading volume of crypto-crypto transactions also increased by 28.61% between January and April 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe platform also recorded a 114.33% increase in users across Africa between January and April 2021. Binance\u2019s growth is consistent with a report by Nairametrics claiming that there was a surge in P2P bitcoin transactions following the CBN\u2019s ban.\n\nTo increase its presence in Africa, Binance invested in Nigerian startup, Xend Finance.\n\nWhile Binance\u2019s African operations seem to be on the rise, the same cannot be said for its US operations. The startup is under investigation by the US Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service. US federal officials are investigating whether its citizens are using the platform\u2019s services to fund illicit activities and evade taxes.\n\nBinance\u2019s growth in the period under review is further proof that Africans will continue to use cryptocurrencies. Rather than place roadblocks in the path of users, this might be the time for governments across the continent to rally around startups operating in the space.\n\nTechpoint Startup School holds in Port Harcourt this Thursday!\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has lent its for the call of the Southern Governors to ban open grazing of cattle, noting that the practice must end.\n\nACF Chairman and immediate past Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbe in a statement on Monday said, \u201cthe ACF does not see any reason to object to a decision taken in the best interest of all.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe fact of the matter is that, the crisis emanates from the belief by most herdsmen that they are free to enter any farm, eat up the crops and rape or kill any one raising objections. Nobody or society can accept that.\n\n\u201cThe current high price of garri is one obvious reason of this behavior. Few cassava farms cannot grow to maturity before it is harvested by the farmers. So, food security is already being threatened.\u201d\n\nChief Ogbe however said there is the need to advise the governors in all states not to think that merely banning open grazing will end the crisis, stressing that \u201cThe bulk of the violent herders are the ones marching in from neighboring African countries in large numbers, thousands at a time and showing no regards to boundaries whether State or regional. They have to be stopped.\n\n\u201cTherefore the Umar Abdullahi Ganduje formula must be adopted to stop the entry into Nigeria of cattle from West Africa. The solution is for Nigeria to seek an amendment to Article 3 of the ECOWAS protocol especially as regards the free movement of cattle and other livestock without special permits.\n\n\u201cIf this is done, we have over 5 million hectares of land in old grazing reserves left, enough to accommodate over 40 million cows if well grassed and watered.\n\n\u201cNorthern governors should immediately look into this and see the viability. Within those spaces, ranches can be developed for lease to Nigerian herders so that this matter can be brought to an end. Thereafter any herders found roaming can be penalized.\n\n\u201cOur ECOWAS neighbours can find ways to deal with their own issues the way they deem fit. We can seek support from AFDB, the World Bank EU or the Kuwait Fund or any source willing to support us in resolving this problem. Hurling abuses, trading suspicion and threatening warfare as is currently the trend will only produce grief and disaster,\u201d he said.",

The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States, and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and other cleavages.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC Government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\nThe governors also re-iterated their earlier call on the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that would ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\nThose in attendance were Aminu Waziri Tambuwal ( Sokoto State), Udom Emmanuel ( Akwa Ibom State), Douye Diri (Bayelsa State), Samuel Ortom (Benue State), and Ifeanyi Okowa Delta State.\n\nOthers were Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu State), Nyesom Wike (Rivers State), Seyi Makinde (Oyo State), Ahmadu Fintiri (Adamawa State), and Godwin Obaseki (Edo State).\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State was also there while Deputy Governor Mahdi Mohd represented his boss Bello Matawalle",

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum has unanimously backed Southern governors\u2019 ban on open grazing as a panacea to the herders/farmers clashes in the country.\n\nThe governors, who met in Ibadan, Oyo State capital on Monday to further review the State of the nation, particularly, as it concerns the worsening security situation and the country\u2019s collapsing economy, maintained that ranching remains the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria.\n\nIn attendance were: Gov. Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, (Rivers); Gov. Udom Emmanuel, (Akwa Ibom); Gov. Douye Diri, (Bayelsa); Gov. Samuel Ortom, (Benue); Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, (Enugu); Gov. Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, (Delta); Gov. Ahmadu Umaru Fintini, (Adamawa); Gov. Godwin Obaseki, (Edo); Gov. Bala Mohammed (Bauchi) and the Deputy Gov. Mahdi Mohammed, (Zamfara).\n\nChairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who read the 6 point communique at the end of the one-day consultative meeting, advised President Muhammad Buhari to immediately send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the country\u2019s Constitution to devolve more powers to the States, with respect to security arrangements culminating in some form of State Policing and the general security architecture.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, Mr President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr President and all State Governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that the Police Force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\u201d\n\nThe PDP Governors reiterated their earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\n\nThe forum said it was in support for the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\nThey enjoined all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC Government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\u201d\n\nThe PDP governors commended Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South West Zone to ensure that PDP takes over majority of the States in the Zone in 2023.",

          "text": "\u200b\n\nFormer Presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba has started off yet another controversy with his claim of cows having more economic value than the entire oil and gas reserve in the country.\n\nGarba who took to Twitter to lay out the claim, also disclosed that he supports Miyetti Allah\u2019s directive for Fulani herdsmen to leave Southern states.\n\nHe tweeted;\n\nI perfectly agree with this proposal. All Fulani present in Southern Nigeria should come back. We shall use the cattle, process the resources, and sell all over the world as finished goods. Miyetti Allah Asks Fulani Herders To Leave Southern States Cattle have more economic value than the entire oil and gas reserve we have in Nigeria. Our major stakeholders in the North must admit cows as business opportunities not just culture & invest heavily to bring #CowToCurrency to reality. Cows alone can solve all Northen problems.\n\nGarba also listed ways the Northern part of the country can make money to develop the region through cattle business.\n\nHe added;\n\nThe job opportunities, the manufacturing centers, & the connection to global hubs of demands for the best cattle meats can open more doors and set for the liberation of Northern Nigeria from cheap and somewhat, useless oil assets. We must invest in harvesting the value of cattle A litter of Cow at N350 is much more than the value of a liter of oil at N145. With over 20 million cows, take 1/3 as milk-producing female on average of 5 liters a day, we\u2019ll have almost N12Bn/day from cow milk. That\u2019s about N700M/state/day. About N21Bn/State/Month. That is much higher than the Monthly Allocation the largest state receives in the North. Again, each cow can generate a minimum of 3 Jobs. Rearing, Slughtring, Processing, marketing, Selling, and management. 5M cows =15M jobs. I marveled at the laziness of Northern Governors. Northern Governors think awarding contracts for building roads, taking their cuts is all they need for themselves. Doing so has subjected the North to condescension and dehumanization from some elements in the South. The time is now for them to wake up to our potentials.\n\nThe former Presidential aspirant also claimed that the 2023 election will be a \u201cgame between cattle states & non-cattle states\u201d.\n\nHe tweeted;\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that the 2023 election is a game between cattle states & non-cattle states. Let\u2019s be blunt about this. If Northern leaders do not wake up to this urgent reality, the target will not just be the cow, but the cow harboring states & their adherents From each cow, you have: Oil Meat Skin Milk Horn Bones Dungs Grasses More fertile land. You also have:: Land Gold Diamond Silver Oil/gas Cement Rivers Fishes All Agricultural produce culture values forests Sahara etc. Why would you ever wait for Oil and Oil only? Shame!",

And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019ll continue to do until everybody is free and until every corrupt individual is either in the grave or be hanged or is in the prison.\n\n\u201cThe difference between us and some of you is that when we say things, we do it.

Why? Because we defeated them in the East. We rendered them useless. Because of the work that Eastern Security Network did in the past, is doing now and will continue to do.\n\n\u201cThat is the why the southern governors came together only last week to announce a ban on open grazing. To try for the very first time in their life to confront head-on this Fulani Islamic hegemony as a result of the bravery and sacrifice of the Eastern Security Network.\n\n\u201cEvery DSS office that we know must be placed under surveillance and we must begin to deal with them as we lay our hands on them,\u201d Kanu said.",

          "text": "\n\nBusiness and commercial activities in Kaduna state came to a standstill on Monday as the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) commenced its five days warning strike to protest the sack of 4,000 workers by Governor Nasir el-Rufai. The five-day warning strike by the NLC and its affiliate unions and associations, which was also to forestall further proposed sacks by Kaduna state government, saw the state thrown into complete darkness since Saturday as the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) switched off the 33kva injection sub-station serving the state at Mando.\n\n\n\nImpact of the total blackout was further felt by the citizens, as supply of fuel to Kaduna state was cut-off, leaving filling stations in Kaduna to close shop and join the strike as residents seeking fuel for their generators were left at the mercy of black market operators who now sell fuel at exorbitant rates to make good profit while the strike lasts.\n\n\n\nActivities at the Kaduna International Airport was also in a lull as the airport was under lock and key since Monday morning with no plane taking off or landing at the airport.\n\nThe Rigasa train station terminal serving the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna trains and passengers also took time off as no train came to the Rigasa station, while no train left as well.\n\nThere have been threats to the labour movement that the strike will not be effective because private sector workers would not join, but that became a ruse as all the commercial banks visited by our correspondent in Kaduna were locked up due to the strike action.\n\nThough immediate past president of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Comrade Najim Yasin was one of the labour leaders that led the labour protest procession to Kaduna State House of Assembly from the NLC state secretariat, taxi and commercial bus drivers were still going about their businesses without let.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, NLC Chairman Kaduna state, Comrade Ayuba Suleiman Magaji, urged, \u201cresidents of the state to remain calm and peaceful throughout the five days warning strike period. We are assuring the Kaduna state workers and the general public of our commitment to maintain peaceful strike action.\u201d\n\nHe said while they were misled to commend the state government over the N30,000 minimum wage, \u201cthe government reverted to old minimum wage of N18, 000 in the month of April, 2021 salary in the local government council, about 20, 000 state civil servants received half salary which is even less than the former N18, 000 minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\u201cHealth workers were denied almost all their allowances such as hazard, call duty, shifting, rural posting. Kaduna state government on the bases of their claim that it had paid up to N14 billion as arrears of death benefit and gratuity from 2017 but the fact is that the same government disengaged over 35, 000 civil servants in 2017 and up to date over 80 percent have not received their retirement benefits.\n\n\u201cThe state government in its ignorance failed to realize the obvious fact that payments of salaries have multiplying effects on the social- welfare and economy. When salaries are paid it reflect down the line. The unfortunate downsizing of work force in Kaduna state was not done in accordance with the statutory Labour Law, with keen examination of it\u2019s activities from 2017 till date, over 50,000 workers were affected.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver 21,000 teachers were sacked, 5,000 local government workers were equally disengaged in 2017, while another 12,000 state civil servants were also unfairly disengaged and the recent sacking of over 7,000 workers of local government in the month of April, 2021 these lay credence to the figure given by the NLC.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nTen years ago, an 18-year-old stormed the Nigerian music industry with \u2018Back When\u2019 and \u2018Dami Duro\u2019 tracks that swept across Africa.\n\nFor many, it seemed like the regular case of a new artiste hitting luck in quick succession. But for those who had known the teenage sensation, this was the birth of a new star.\n\nThe first track, \u201cBack When\u201d was a faux attempt to explore a struggle narrative. But fortunately, David Adeleke redirected his narrative and embraced his privileged status with Dami Duro.\n\nAnd \u201cDami Duro\u201d, co-produced by Shizzi, was the perfect introduction to Davido. As one from an affluent family, his background afforded him the leeway to pursue music as a hobbie, but with Dami Duro, Davido stood in our faces, shouting at the top of his lungs \u201cI am from a rich family, I own my representation and no one can stop me\u201d\n\n10 years on, and Davido has walked the talk. He has had an enviable career laden with multiple hit tracks and lots of real awards to brag with.\n\nDavido\u2019s story is one that deserves to be told and this week, NewsWireNGR had a chat with Obinna Agwu, a music executive and talent manager to analyse Davido\u2019s success and detail how his career has been a win for the Afrobeats community.\n\nWhat is the Afrobeat genre?\n\nThere\u2019s Afrobeat and there\u2019s Afrobeats. Afrobeat without the \u2018S\u2019 is the music that Fela worked tirelessly to develop over a long period. From his own band Koola Lobitos to finally refining it to where he started Egypt 80 and everything, and it was because he schooled out there in the West, he took in a lot of their sound and all of that. But at some point, Fela felt the need to really stand apart from the music he had learnt and he wanted to make it more African than more make it more authentic.\n\nSo Afrobeat is the music today that emerged from the genius who spent tireless time in developing and working on it in the 60s.\n\nSo now to the Afrobeats with the \u2018S\u2019. A lot of people are going to say to you that unlike Afrobeat that is a distinct sound with elements, Afrobeats music isn\u2019t particularly a genre. It is just the overarching umbrella sound of the music out of West Africa.\n\nAnother funny thing is that the word Afrobeat was first coined or used by a Ghanaian-based DJ in the UK called DJ Atlantic. He was on radio at a time, and he had a show on a certain radio station and at that point he introduced a lot of African music. I guess after some time he felt the need to call it something, so that\u2019s where Afrobeat came from. Afrobeat is pretty much a sound from West Africa, the overarching sound of the umbrella music from West Africa.\n\nAfrobeats looks like the biggest export from Africa to the world right now, can give us a rundown of the evolution of the genre?\n\nWhen you talk about Afrobeats music, there are a lot of elements and a lot of people to thank. For example In 2005, people like MTV Base made their entry into Nigeria and to Africa. What those platforms did was that they gave us an avenue to expose our music to a bigger and wider audience within Africa and the world.\n\nHowever, at that time what we know as Afrobeats hasn\u2019t quite started to happen so at that time We had the 9ice, we had the P-Square, Naeto C, Ikechukwu, Mo\u2019 Hits, MI and all these people things, so as our music continued to grow I would say it was in early 2010 that Afrobeat started to form and shape up into something, especially with people like Wizkid, and there\u2019s really no way we would talk about Afrobeat victory without bringing the UK into it.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately because the UK ended up playing a huge role that helped in disseminating the sound support, and it was very obvious because we have a lot of Nigerians out there, a lot of Africans out there. So the UK is really much like an annex of Africa, so the UK and the regions of the UK and the people of the UK definitely played the huge role in helping to disseminate the sound support just like in everything, as you start to earn success, more people want to tap in, more people want to understand what you\u2019re doing. So before we knew it people like Drake came in and wanted to do stuff, J Hus plenty people, Skepta, so many people started to identify with the sound and these people came with their own huge following and their own audience. I\u2019d say that Afrobeat as a sound or as a musical consciousness , pretty much started in the 2010s and yes, we are like ten years deep into all of that now. So shout-out to Davido, shout out to Wizkid , shout to all these people who helped to push the sounds up.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to discuss Afrobeats rise without mentioning Davido, a man who recently clocks a decade in the industry. What do you think has defined his career so far in the industry?\n\nResilience and Passion. At the initial stage a lot of people did not consider David to be the most obviously talented person.\n\nBut one thing you could tell from David was that this kid was hungry, this kid wanted this thing, this Kid is going to do anything to get it , as God would have it he seems to have financial support on his path, but why I would not talk so much about that is that before David and even after David, we have seen a lot of rich kid , right? So money is not the only reason David is such a star. As a manager and an administrator, I have run with people who have money but their money is for their lifestyle and it\u2019s not for the music and when it\u2019s time to invest in music they would not, but with David , David realised that okay, I have the wherewithal to do what I need to do, he really put his money where his mouth is and he went all out for it.\n\nSo I would say resilience and passion first of all and over time we have seen this guy improve and get better and better. So it\u2019s not hard to say that David has been growing because over time he has shown us that.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Davido has undergone a lot of evolution to stay relevant. What has been the biggest?\n\nFor me, his biggest evolution has been his ability to spot great songs. His ability to work with amazingly gifted people and you must understand that sometimes these people are not necessarily the most affordable people to work it but David has displayed creative maturity over time.\n\nIn Nigeria a lot of people at his level wouldn\u2019t be open to come and say \u2018somebody wrote this song with me, or I took the song from somebody\u2019. But, we have seen David do that from time to time . From \u2018Gobe\u2019 to T Spize that wrote \u2018Aye\u2019 to collaborating with Peruzzi on a lot of songs, to working with Adekunle Gold on One Milli , so you can tell that David has a mentality that a lot of his peers and people do not have.\n\nHe is open , he understands music, he goes to a place and hears a song and says Yo, this song, I want this song, I need to sing this song, I would buy this song off you, what is it going to take , so over time David has shown that he is an incredible Musician and he has the ear for good music and also likes working with with gifted people.\n\nA lot of people say his special sauce is creating monster hits, how true is this? And how easy is it?\n\nHis special sauce is recognising monster hit, so when somebody tries to downplay David\u2019s greatness and say he is not talented, I\u2019m like yoo, it takes a lot of talent to spot hit, it was this boy who spotted \u2018Gobe\u2019 and he bought it, this guy who spotted \u2018Aye\u2019, and he bought it, he spotted even \u2018Fem\u2019.\n\nHe said some people were working at his studio, the song was not even meant for him, he now pulled up, he heard it and he was like yoo I\u2019m using this work, it takes talent to be able to spot those things you know and the ability to collaborate with very gifted people, all these things are talent, these are things his father\u2019s money cannot afford him. So yeah, Davido definitely has superpower for creating songs that are amazing.\n\n\u2018IF\u2019 was written by Tekno so you can tell that this guy is actually steps ahead of his peers. He is able to collaborate with the right people and he is able to spot amazing songs and say so you know what we are going to do with this one.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference in delivery even when one buy songs\n\nDefinitely, and he does that well. Like \u2018Gobe\u2019, he ended up not using the actual beat and he got.bI think he got Chizzi, and David has done so many things like this with his songs. So you can tell that this guy really has something, he knows something, something that can\u2019t just be learnt, something his father\u2019s money can\u2019t buy.\n\nWhat other elements of music marketing has Davido mastered to keep him going for over ten years?\n\nI think his use of social media has been very impressive over the years and that\u2019s why If I am not mistaken I think he even has more followers than Wizkid on Instagram.\n\nThat says a lot because Wizkid is quite a superstar. But for some reason, that followers count means that more people are trying to see something on David\u2019s side than on Wiz\u2019s side and it\u2019s just that when people love you and they admire you , they want to know more about you and David let\u2019s you in. You see his friends, you see his travels, you see his kids and even when he\u2019s ranting he puts it up there and another thing, David is so giving off his platform, that\u2019s something we have seen over time, I\u2019ve seen and then when he sees something that\u2019s amazing, he is always making sure he finds a way behind it through his platform I think in some way these things get to people and they love you more and support you.\n\nAlso, David is actually a businessman and he is very clinical about these things. If you get on YouTube and say you want to sit down and watch David\u2019s videos, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time there. And you know that these videos are shot by Clarence Peters. If you put it into naira and kobo, you would see that we are talking about hundreds of millions so a lot of people make money and they struggle putting that money back into their business but not David.\n\nHe\u2019s a great businessman and his use of social media has been very impressive and he has a heart of working with the right people.\n\nA lot of people have pointed at his humility in recalling Asa, as a key moment in his career\n\nYou see what he displayed, these are the things people love about David. David\u2019s ability to be honest and to just come out of a situation and say this is what it is.\n\nLike the project he did with Sony, that international project, David would openly say to you, I don\u2019t like that project, that project carries my name but I do not like it, I don\u2019t think it was me, I don\u2019t think I was allowed to do what I really wanted to do. It\u2019s not a lot of artistes who are able to look at their work and say ohhh I do not like this work .\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big level of honesty and sincerity and I think people can really connect with that. And on a human level when you have that type of understanding, it puts you in a place where you can learn and get better.\n\nTo Asa, I happen to be there to some extent. Asa started out working for his uncle\u2019s record company, Storm records, and of course you know Storm records at the time in Nigeria were like the biggest record label Nigeria. So that gave him a platform, that gave him access to do a lot of things and meet a lot of people. So I remember there was a time when Asa was hosting club nights in a lot of big clubs or Storm was handling PR for a lot of big clubs and it was him who would directly manage that relationship. So overtime, this guy had a strong contact base and I saw him first hand deploy all of this to push his music forward.\n\nAnd David is very clinical in his actions. He knows what he wants to do and he goes for it. We talked about \u201cBack When\u201d, do you know that he paid Naeto C for that feature? One would think that because Asa is his little cousin things would come easily, no, that feature was paid for and it was business, at that point how many people were paid? I think he paid about a million naira for him to do the audio and then be on the video. The video was shot by Clarence Peters, and over time we have seen how many more Clarence Peters videos he has made. Meaning that he wants the quality of the work to be good every step of his way .\n\nI can\u2019t say how the disagreement happened, but these things happen, at some point they fell in and then Kamal came in and a lot of things. But it takes a lot of honesty and sincerity for you to look at something and say, I should go back to this guy, this really loves me and was out for my best interest and he did just that.\n\nAnd from a manager\u2019s point of view, that was for me a key moment in the industry because I don\u2019t remember seeing stuff like that happen a lot of times. When an artiste falls out with his manager, and they go back to do their thing and honestly say \u2018you\u2019re the person who can do this thing, I\u2019m sorry about everything, let us just keep going\u2019. I strongly believe that as we celebrate David we ought to celebrate Asa as well.\n\nA lot of people think 2016 was Davido\u2019s biggest moment. I saw a video on twitter and it was a thread of different renowned celebrities singing those 2016 fire songs, FIA, IF and Fall. There was even a Kanye West sample. How did David crack the international scene with those songs?\n\nLike I said, David is very passionate, very driven, when he feels like it\u2019s time to get things done, he goes out to get it. Yes, he was already shutting things down on the Africa front, but that \u2018IF\u2019 victory was a calculated promo plan on their path.\n\nI\u2019m sure he must have sent them back some decent dollars to some announcers in American and possibly gotten some help with the international labels he was in at that time. This was someone basically saying I think it\u2019s about time we get this thing done and he went all out and then made it happen. It took some time but eventually the figures and everything started to add up. That was another coordinated plan by David and his team.\n\nDavido has amassed over a billion streams so far and I think that\u2019s very rich, how critical is digital streaming to the growth of Afrobeats?\n\nVery critical, and it is not like we have a choice because digital streaming is where the parties are right now. There\u2019s nobody who is trying to engage with your physical products anymore and there\u2019s nobody trying to buy your VHS or anything.\n\nSo it\u2019s not like we have a choice but it\u2019s a good thing people think that we were deemed enough to engage in those platforms and we woke up to the right technology and partnership of technology early enough. Imagine that we made all these things happen without our own numbers being registered on platforms like Spotify. Spotify just only came to Nigeria this year. So it just shows that despite all the numbers you have been seeing on Spotify, Nigerians in Nigeria our numbers are not even there.\n\nIt just shows how much better these things are going to be, and we have Audiomack, we have YouTube, we have Apple music, we have Spotify these brands have also realised that we Nigerians are an important market. And shout out to Nigerians in diaspora, they continue to push the culture forward. I like to think that they are the unsung heroes of Afrobeats music, because Nigerians everywhere and we can make music everywhere. Maybe that\u2019s the advantage we have over other countries because of the chances that you\u2019re going to find Nigerians everywhere. We are always travelling so It\u2019s easy for our music to travel as well. Hopefully, the internet data can get cheaper and more people can be able to access smart phones and all these gadgets and then stream it down and more people can be able to jam in and help grow this ecosystem.\n\nBurnaboy and Wizkid, recently bagged the grammy awards, will Davido get one soon?\n\nI think David is very close to it, because away from the music, the Grammy sometimes can tend to be like a popularity contest sometimes and, David is quite high up there and more than anything this dude has shown us that he has the ability to continue to bag out this heat. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any stopping that soon. This guy is not even 30 years old yet so David definitely has a lot of time on his clock to go out there and make it happen. He has the pedigree, he has the connections, he has the finance, he has everything, and ultimately he has music.\n\nI like to think eventually, David is going to be on his stage, hold his neck and say \u2018E choke\u2019 at some point.\n\nIn a recent interview with Ebuka, Davido said stuff like, Grammy no be by force. Do you think he can be as intentional as Burna Boy was or probably deviate from his light hearted niche?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think David has found his sweet spot. It\u2019s almost like we have forgotten but the huge positive uprising that happened last year, which is the EndSARS movement, David\u2019s song ended up being the song track for that whole movement.\n\nSo this man makes impactful music, he has the pedigree to back it up, He has the fanbase, he has the people, he has everything. So David has found his sweet spot. I don\u2019t think everyone has to sound the same.\n\nFor Burnaboy from the job, for those of us who were following him, everyone saw the view that at some point this guy called Burna Boy is going to win a Grammy. I\u2019m one of those people who wasn\u2019t surprised. I was literally just counting down to the day, he\u2019s that gifted, and his international appeal and his close relationship with Atlantic. Atlantic realised they had a gem in their hand and they really went out to position him like one.\n\nHow do you make an album like that and you do not have a Grammy? It\u2019s impossible. Diddy is your executive producer, Anderson Park is playing drums in there and Youssou N\u2019Dour is in there, you know, and all this other thing, and then you have the world\u2019s famous Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin\u2019s on that record. So every step of the way, you know this was a Grammy product, this was positioned for that and it eventually got it. Besides, a year before he had gotten a nomination, the one that he lost to another African legend Angelique Kidjo, so everybody just knew that it\u2019s only a matter of time, this guy is gonna get this nomination again and he\u2019s going to win. So, I have no doubt in my mind that as long as David continues to do his thing, he is going to win it at some point.\n\nWould there be any career regret if Davido never wins a Grammy?\n\nNo, there will be none. He is an accomplished artiste as it is. It was this year that Nas got his Grammy for the first time and there are plenty of other people that never got the Grammy but we know that these people are some of the finest artistes. Do you know Snoop Dogg never won a Grammy?\n\nSo there are plenty of other people like that, so sometimes these things happen. Maybe you dropped a project in a year, well then just so happened to be like a bigger or more popular project and then, you know there are those variables and these things that happen. So in my opinion David is really an accomplished musician, he has traveled round the world, he has met everybody, he has made money, he has made a clout, I mean what else is there to do? At this point he just needs to keep making music because that is what he has feelings for.\n\nWhat can young hungry artistes out there learn from Davido?\n\nBe open to collaboration. Know that using a songwriter does not mean you\u2019re a terrible musician, sometimes you write alone, sometimes you need to sing somebody\u2019s perspective to give your music that bit of freshness.\n\nSecond, you need to show that you want it, you need to be hungry about this thing, like I said before, David is not the first rich kid we have seen, but we have seen plenty of them who didn\u2019t seem to have that fight in them.\n\nThird, you have to be passionate, this is what you love, submit to it. One vibe you get from David is that this brother has genuine love for music. Just follow your heart, be passionate, be hardworking and if you have money to put in, put it in, be an entrepreneur.\n\nI want to add something else, just in case we don\u2019t get to touch that. Let us not forget that in the history of artistes who run record labels, we possibly have not had anyone that has been successful as DMW. So away from being an artiste, even as an executive or a label guy, David has been hugely successful, Mayorkun is big, Perruzi is big, Dremo, all these other people, so unlike all other guys who have tried to start a label, even the people he\u2019s competing with, a lot of them do not have anything going on that level, but away from David being this guy, he has also successfully built a platform that is huge as well, so David the executive also deserves a lot of kudos.\n\nHas Afrobeats peaked with this Grammy win and its present level of influence?\n\nI do not think so. If anything, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re just getting started. I was recently saying to someone, these days it appears like the producers outside Nigeria are even starting to make better Afrobeats production or songs than us. People like Jay Five, people like P2J, there\u2019s this guy in Los Angeles who does work for Tiwa savage and Seyi Shay plenty of these people, these guys are making incredible stuff. You know how a black American cannot really really say hip hop is our thing anymore because in Asia they now make hip hop, Africans make hip hop, a lot of people make hip hop, so that\u2019s the beauty of your tradition on your product going across. It sort of gets to a place where it feels like it\u2019s no longer yours anymore because a lot of people have now bought into your product and they love it so I see that happening with Afrobeats.\n\nAnother thing is that these guys are still young and they\u2019re going to continue making music. Wizkid is a big superstar, look at what he did with Made in Lagos, so projects like that help to reinforce the importance of this genre, people like Burna Boy, Burna Boy is only just getting started, Davido is a young man, he\u2019s just getting started, let\u2019s not even talk about the younger people who are coming behind them, Buju, Joeboy, Fireboy DML, Tems, all these people, so I think we\u2019re only just getting started.\n\nHow can the government key into the million dollars Afrobeats industry now and provide active and actual beneficial support to the growth of the industry now?\n\nMaybe that ship might have sailed because before we got into this digital age, we used to beg the government to come and help us stop piracy, come and help us stop this people who are creating our CDs and selling, come and help us stop these people in Alaba who are faking our products, but now with digital, nobody even cares about them anymore, so you find out that more and more we don\u2019t even need to talk to these people, we don\u2019t need them for anything. The labels have stepped up, were getting investments, international labels are coming in to partner with our local guys here, we have big artiste development and artiste relation companies like Platoon, like ONErpm, like Empire, like Orchard and all this people coming to Nigeria to set up shop, so it appears that through our own sheer determination and hard work, we have taken this thing to a level where it has really taken off, all the government can do is to congratulate people where the would help us.\n\nSo there\u2019s no role left for the government now?\n\nPerhaps that ship has sailed, so maybe they should perhaps help us add more event centres, you know just put in laws and regulations that help people to do business more easily. But generally, the success has gone beyond them.\n\nFans of Davido, Wizkid and Burna Boy are always pitching against themselves on social media. Is this beneficial to the artistes or can it be very damaging to their career and industry growth in the long term?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Because these people are the people who speak up and drum up support for these people that helps to take them to the next level. So now the onus is on the artistes and their handlers to understand that hey, you people must remain friends ooh. You must know that these people would always come with these competitive problems but you guys must know that hey, fans are just doing what fans do.\n\nHowever the competitiveness is what makes it fun. A lot of times, if there\u2019s no competition people are not really bothered to go the extra mile, so there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\n\nDavido coming to tweet and say \u2018Yo, my fans stop doing this doesn\u2019t change anything\u2019, yeah, you get on Twitter you would discover that there are a lot of handles that are dedicated solely to these guys and all they do is talk about them, tweet them and drop fights and everything. So at that point it is out of your hand, it is just up to you to understand that now it\u2019s part of the game, but these people are my brothers and we should not let what the fans say make us enemies but however, the noise that the fans are making out is important.\n\nObinna Agwu is a music executive and talent manager who has had in his clientele MI Abaga amid a plethora of other artistes.\n\nListen to his expert analysis of happenings in the entertainment industry on Listening Session Podcast",

So has the price of food, he adds grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s just chaos,\u201d says Dotun Babande, who runs a juice shop across town.\n\nInflation is running at 18%. For food it is 23%, the highest in two decades. More than half of Nigerians are underemployed or unemployed. Before covid-19 about 80m of Nigeria\u2019s 200m people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic andpopulation growth could see that figure rise to almost 100m by 2023,says the World Bank.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic woes also help explain a vertiginous rise in crime. More people were kidnapped in the first four months of this year thanall of last year, according to Jose Luengo-Cabrera of the World Bank.This has added to worsening violence around three flashpoints: thejihadists of Boko Haram in the north-east; a long-standing conflict between farmers and cattle- herders across central Nigeria; and fighting between government forces and Igbo separatists in the south-east.\n\nCovid-19 has slammed economies everywhere, but Nigeria\u2019s economicmalaise predates the pandemic. GDP per person has fallen every yearsince 2015, when oil prices slumped (see chart). The World Bank reckons that by the end of the year real income per person in Nigeria, home to one in six of sub- Saharan Africa\u2019s people, will be at the same level as it was in the 1980s. Reform is desperately needed, but fiendishly difficult to enact.\n\nAlthough oil makes up about 9% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, it accounts for 80% of export earnings and about half of government revenues. A long slump in its price\u2014from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to less than half thatfor most of last year\u2014has squeezed the supply of foreign exchange.\n\nNormally economies would adjust by letting their exchange rates fall, making imports more expensive. This can be painful in the short term since it fuels inflation. But usually it helps boost exports by making them more competitive. If Nigeria could make, grow or mine more forexport, it would be less vulnerable to swings in the oil price.\n\nInstead, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has restricted imports in an effort to prop up the currency, which he sees asa measure of Nigeria\u2019s strength. In an attempt to conserve dollars, thecentral bank has banned those intending to import almost 50 items from buying foreign currency. Last month wheat and sugar were added to the list. In 2019 Mr Buhari closed Nigeria\u2019s land borders to goods to stop smugglers undermining local producers. Both moves have fuelled food-price inflation.\n\nThey have also hobbled manufacturing firms by making it hard for themto obtain inputs. Manufacturers would be lucky if they get 20% of the forex they request, says Muda Yusuf of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Ajibade Oluwabukunmi imports medical equipment and uses the volatile black market, where dollars cost almost 30% more than the official rate. \u201cNigeria is in a shambles,\u201d he laments. Despite all its unorthodox controls, the central bank was forced to devalue the naira twice last year. Businesses are getting neither a stable currency nor access to dollars.\n\nThe government may slowly be changing its tune. Bismarck Rewane, an economist who is also on the president\u2019s council of economic advisers, says that \u201cthe futility of a Robinson Crusoe economy became very clear for everybody\u201d. The government is starting to pay more attention to exporters, he claims, pointing to the partial reopening of land bordersfor goods in December and Nigeria\u2019s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in 2019.\n\nYet sustained growth in exports requires more than just opening the border. Many firms are uncompetitive because they are hampered by red tape and government failures. \u201cGovernment is the biggest problem for business in Nigeria,\u201d says Bashir Abdulrahman of Credent Capital and Advisory, an investment bank.\n\nElectricity blackouts are maddeningly frequent. Roads are often poor and ports clogged up. Moving a container 20km from the port of Lagosto the city can cost $4,000, almost as much as shipping it 12,000km from China. Nigeria ranks 131st out of 190 countries on the World Bank\u2019s ease-of- doing-business index. Although some industries, such as information technology, are growing, this is \u201cin spite of the government\u201d, says Tayo Oviosu of Paga, a mobile-payments company.\n\nThe government has tried to give the poor more aid to get them through the pandemic. It also promises to improve infrastructure. But spending on salaries and other annual costs chews up 75% of the federal budget, leaving little money to invest in roads or railways. With a view to freeing funds for infrastructure, the government last year promised to cut costly fuel subsidies. Yet that has been halted in the face of opposition.\n\nThe stalled reform is typical of Nigeria\u2019s troubles. For decades cash from oil has been used to subsidise things like fuel and electricity. The easy revenue also allowed the federal and state governments to getaway with abysmal tax collection. Worse, it fostered corruption.\n\nMany Nigerians have had enough. Between 2014 and 2018 the percentage who want to emigrate rose from 36% to 52%, one of thehighest levels in Africa. Rising oil prices this year will ease the shortages and boost government finances. Yet that may reduce the pressure to fix deeper economic problems, admits Kayode Fayemi, a state governor. Nonetheless, he believes there is an \u201calmost overwhelming consensus\u201d on the need to restructure the economy. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it,\u201d he warns, \u201cwe run the risk of disintegration.\u201d ?\n\nThis article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \u201cStuck in a rut\u201d for the Economist Magazine.",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 21\n\nIn late 2016, the terror group Boko Haram razed down a community in Borno State \u2013 Bama.\n\nThe Boko Haram elements, whom some were from Bama were vexed that some residents had snitched on them to the army so they set out to destroy all living things and inanimate things in sight.\n\nAfter news of the attack, a group of volunteer civilian care group \u2013 Victims Support Fund were ushered to tend to any possible survivors of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. We travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time,\u201d NewsWireNGR\u2019s guest, Alkasim Abdulkadir, spokesperson to the VSF recalls while explaining how these travels were merely deathtraps.\n\nAnd like Bama, there were other endangering care and rebuilding travels to Chibok, Dikwa and other communities that had suffered attacks by Boko Haram elements.\n\nFor more than 5 years, Alkasim, a seasoned journalist risked his life rebuilding territories destroyed by Boko Haram.\n\nNewsWireNGR\u2019s Oladele Owodina chatted with him for over an hour and he detailed a lot of untold stories he witnessed on the frontline. We couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to explore journalism, nation building and youth politics.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and how can you compare that period to Nigeria today, especially with the recent insecurity challenge in the northern region?\n\nI didn\u2019t have my entire growing up experience in Northern Nigeria; I grew up partly in the north. I came of age in the town or city of Minna and I also partly had my growing up experience in Lagos, because Lagos was the capital city of the country at that time and most civil servants worked in Lagos before the capital was returned to Abuja. My father, being a civil servant worked in Lagos at some point.\n\nGrowing up in Minna, Niger state you can actually see the truism in the saying that it takes a village to raise a child, in the street where I lived, every parent or every household was my household. If I was doing something wrong every member of that household had the right to say stop what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s wrong and they would report me to my parents and it meant that I had to be well-behaved. So this was the atmosphere that I grew up in.\n\nI grew up in the 80s so I can therefore say that I\u2019m a child of the 80s. The 80s were a lot different from the 90s, from the 20s post-millennium age and there weren\u2019t many crimes. The crimes we had were just burglaries, they were lots of burglaries, neighborhood youngsters breaking into homes to steal TV sets, to steal wall clocks, to steal just basic stuff. There was also a bit of armed robbery, and the most tragic and fascinating thing at the same time about the armed robberies was that there would would be a public execution of armed robbers and as children, as very little kids, we would go to the grounds where these executions used to take place to go and watch, you know that was.\n\nIn retrospect, it was wrong for society to have allowed members of the public to see the executions but that was the idea of that time. So in Minna where I grew up, the firing squad ground was at the old airport and people would come from all over to watch armed robbers and assassins being executed, I have vivid memories of this because it used to be very fascinating, also remember that this was the age of action movies, Predator, Commando, No retreat no surrender, we kind of likened what we see in the films with these public executions.\n\nThere was also part of this ethno-religious riot, it was the age of this Kafanchan crisis; it was the age of the riot in Bauchi, these were like the really violent ethno-religious crisis, the spectre of violence always hanged over us.\n\nSo growing up was fascinating, it was an age where there was a lot of family and parental values, where there was a lot of value system being instilled in the schools. I knew how much we respected our teachers, how we hung on to every of their words, The classes of the schools we went to were not very congested until when I finished primary school and I doubt if we were more than twenty-five in my class, we were well attended to by very attentive and intelligent teachers.\n\nWhat are the things that today\u2019s children would miss due to the heightened insecurity problem?\n\nThose who are kids today can\u2019t enjoy the life that we enjoyed where you felt at home in the entire neighborhood. I would give an example where I live now. My kids hardly go to neighbours\u2019 houses, if there are precautions, there are certain houses that they go to, but not everybody\u2019s houses.\n\nWhen I was a child, everyone in the community, every house in the community was your home. You could eat in those houses, but now with the fear of kidnapping, with the fear of distrust between neighbors, you can\u2019t just let your kids enter anybody\u2019s house, so definitely kids would miss that communality, that feeling of belonging to everyone. And then we also enjoyed a lot of plays outdoors, kids now hardly play outdoors, and even when they play outdoors they play within a gated community, but we had the luxury to run around from one neighborhood to the other to play in the sand and all. So these were the privileges that we had, it was a lot, you hardly hear of cases of kidnapping, cases of rituals and all these that came in later on.\n\nBorno State has always been a state with a good cultural presence, the history is culture rich but with the recent insecurity challenge now, do you think the status, artifacts and cultural presence of the state can ever be rebuilt?\n\nFirst of all, Borno State has its state moniker as the Home of peace, so you find out that it\u2019s a bit ironic what has happened whereby there is an insurgency going on for the last 11 years, you know, but if you talk to people who are from Borno State, they would tell you that it was not always like this, they would tell you that in the past, Borno was indeed the home of peace, they would tell you that there was a time when you time you could trade, when you could do your business, when you could do anything without the fear of being attacked, molested or anything.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the case today because there\u2019s been an insurgency in the last 11 years, but I have a strong opinion that this insurgency is not going to last forever. I am very hopeful that either the war ends militarily or either the war ends at a negotiating table , one day the war would come to an end, and Borno State would again be the home of peace.\n\nHistorians would tell you that this uprising, this insurrection is not the first time that it\u2019s happening in the history of Borno State. The Kanem Bornu empire is an institution that has lasted for more than a thousand years, and they\u2019d tell you that in their one thousand years of existence, they have had several episodes of insurrection, Several episodes of insurgency, and after each and every one, they have come out stronger. So I can\u2019t put a time to when peace is going to return to Borno State but what I know for sure is that this is not going to last forever.\n\nIn the last five years, a lot of communities have found their voices, a lot of communities have tried to rebuild themselves, and it\u2019s exciting in my line of work I have been part of the rebuilding process in Bama, I\u2019ve been part of the rebuilding process in Dikwa, Borno. I\u2019ve also been part of the rebuilding process in other towns in Adamawa state. So I\u2019m hopeful that one day all these military actions would end and a proper framework of rebuilding would come up, and the state would go back to the way it was.\n\nWhat are the biggest but under-reported stories of insurgency you have discovered during the course of your work?\n\nFor me I will not say the biggest stories, but three issues come to my mind, three issues where I\u2019d like our journalist to shed more light on to be able to talk about them in this conversation and then I\u2019d go ahead to mention them.\n\nThe first one is the orphans \u2013 children who have lost either parent or children who have lost both parents. This is one major issue that is very close to my heart. About three years ago, the then Governor of Borno State, Governor Kashim Shettima said there were about fifty thousand orphans in Borno State alone. If you look at that number, it\u2019s not an issue that is highly reported. Fifty thousand is a lot, and now when you look at these children who are orphans, you would think about their education, you would think about how their tomorrow will be, you will begin to tell yourself how are they going to be turn out, But fifty thousand alone who have lost either one parent or both parent is a huge number, It is also an issue that is highly under-reported.\n\nTwo major efforts I know that have been done in that area is the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osibanjo, alongside his friends came up with the idea of building a north-east learning centre, whereby they were able to enroll one thousand orphans in the school, with a very wonderful education curriculum, where the students are groomed and they have their nanny, they have their own hostels; they have their own farm. This is a successful story but these are just one thousand orphans out of fifty thousand.\n\nThe victim support fund which is another organisation that I have been involved also came up with an idea that they call First healthcare system whereby it takes two orphans and reintegrate them in the community where they come from and ensure that a family comprising a father and mother adopt these children and then the victim support fund gives these families an allowance of fourteen thousand naira per child making twenty-eight thousand for two children every month, there are other people that have been able to build schools, to enroll these orphans.\n\nThe second story is that of missing people. There are thousands of people who have gone missing and these people range from citizens, doctors and nurses, soldiers, policemen to NGO workers. They have disappeared off the face of the earth, never to be seen again. If they are military, they are regarded as missing in action. If they are civilians, they are regarded as sometimes as forced disappearances. This is a really tragic and under-reported story. Some of them went missing because they were caught in between crossfires of the military and the insurgents and some of them have not been seen afterwards.\n\nThe third component which I would say is, what I would like to refer to as transnational crimes and criminal networks. What has happened is that a war economy has developed in the north-east, and to fill the vacuum of the war economy is that people are aiding and abetting the war economy and they have become criminals. To be able to make money, they service the value chain of the insurgents. They smuggle petroleum products; they smuggle bread, they smuggle fish, they smuggle cows across borders. This is sometimes done with the collaboration of security operatives along the countries in the Lake Chad region so a war economy has been built with a very strong Influence of transnational crimes. We also have on authority, there\u2019s a lot of drug smuggling from the populace to the insurgents because the insurgents are very hooked under and all kinds of drugs. But because it\u2019s an active war environment, it\u2019s almost impossible to do these stories and have the verified independent source.\n\nYou have been on the frontline in different routes and helping people who are victims of the insurgency, has there been any near death experience for you?\n\nSure, there have been so many near-death experiences especially if you take into consideration that we travel in an enemy territory.\n\nSo in the six years that I was actively working in the northeast, we travelled on roads that had suffered scorched-earth attacks. What I mean by scorched-earth attack is that we were traveling through communities that have been totally destroyed to the extent that you\u2019ll not find a goat, a hen or even a lizard. nothing existed in that community. For example, we were part of the first civilian team that visited Bama and I think in late 2016 after Bama had suffered a siege of Boko Haram.\n\nWhat happened was that when Boko Haram were leaving Bama, most of the Boko Haram members that took over Bama were from Bama, so when the army was approaching they were so upset that they burnt the entire city to the ground. They destroyed every house, destroyed every police station, destroyed every hospital, destroyed every bank, and ensured that nothing stood in Bama. And it was discovered that there were still few survivors, we were the first coordinated team that entered Bama. So it meant that we travelled from Maiduguri to Bama and there were no single souls on the way except soldiers on the way. It meant that we could be attacked at any time. Also at the point where we travelled from Damboa to Chibok, there were absolutely no one on those roads. And after every of these trips there was always a major attack.\n\nSo on this day we were going from Maiduguri to Chibok and there was a clearance operation going on so when we were given the go ahead to pass, they were so many armoured vehicles, they were so many soldiers and a lot of M-RAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) all lined along the way because they had come for clearance along the way. What is meant by operations clearance is that the army has come and they are making arrests of Boko Haram operatives and we had to stop. When we were passing, we realized that the Boko Haram operatives that were caught were made to sit down on the floor, because they were being profiled and they were being arrested.\n\nAn M-RAP is an extremely expensive machine that costs between five hundred dollars to one million dollars and the Nigerian Army has a couple of it in the northeast.\n\nVery recently we flew an aircraft, a Dornier 228 from Akwa Ibom to Bayelsa and soon as the aircraft dropped us, it couldn\u2019t fly back because it had engine failure. The aircraft dropped us in Bayelsa, when we got to the hotel, we learnt that the crew could not fly back because they had engine failure.\n\nIt was just a matter of some minutes, and anything could have happened\n\nAnd I think they spent almost 72hours trying to fix the engine and we had to look for alternative transportation out of Bayelsa State.\n\nIf the worst had happened, and you had tough luck during those journeys, would you have been satisfied? Or what made you keep going despite knowing this could be the end?\n\nYes, I love my country very much and I will say to myself that I did my best and everyone who knows me would be like Yes I gave my word to my country.\n\nMoving away from insurgency so we don\u2019t box you in that corner. You have been privileged to practice journalism in Nigeria and outside Nigeria for both local and international platforms, do you think journalism we see today is diluted to fit the modern society?\n\nWell, I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have gotten access to information, and also I think there\u2019s no time in history that journalists have delivered subpar work than today. For some funny reasons, it\u2019s my view that journalists don\u2019t put in the required work for excellent journalist work. I have a feeling that journalists are more interested in press releases, in covering events compared to when I started my practice of journalism, there was an actual hunger to tell stories, to shape narratives, to be curious, to unveil what was not in the public sphere, but that\u2019s not the case today.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame the journalists totally, we\u2019ve gotten to a time whereby we\u2019ve seen a decrease in funding of journalists and media houses, where we have been able to build a culture whereby journalists are not paid, and journalists are required to survive on their own. So there\u2019s no incentive, there\u2019s no hunger to actually tell the stories that matter and almost all the stories in newspapers are paid for. What is popularly called the brown envelope syndrome is very pervasive, so you only find that it\u2019s very few newspapers who have a \u201cNo Thank You\u201d policy, but the rest have almost legitimised the phenomenon of the brown envelope. This is an indictment on all of us, because the readers, the government, the audience and everyone should be able to pay a premium for news.\n\nSome organisations are already putting their news stories behind paywalls, if you want to read premium news, if you want to read premium stories, then pay for it. Some news organisations have already started receiving grants to be able to tell some stories, that\u2019s also a very good development, but we can\u2019t all reap where we did not sow. So if we expect stellar work from journalists, we should be able to have stellar investment in journalism. So it\u2019s a 360 issue. If you\u2019re saying that journalists are not putting their best, are you giving journalists their best?.\n\nWhen I was a reporter, I benefited from a lot of training both in Nigeria and abroad. I had the hunger to do the work, I put my life on the line to do the work and all that. When I worked for BBC media action, I had a life insurance, I go to places to tell stories and all that, but that couldn\u2019t have been said for my colleagues who work for other media organisations, so these are the things we need to put in place if we want to get the quality of Journalism we deserve.\n\nLet\u2019s go a bit personal now. Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently if given the chance?\n\nThis is a very deep question that requires some retrospection. Well, if given the chance, the only thing I can think of is that I could have worked harder and done better than I had.\n\nYou\u2019re 40+, it\u2019s almost 11pm over there and you\u2019re in an interview. This probably shows that you worked hard when you were younger.\n\nYes!\n\nDoes that mean that hard work was not enough?\n\nWell, if you take a look at it. In spite of all the work that we put in, in spite of all the stories that we talked about, in spite of the networks that we built and all of that, Nigeria is still in this vicious circle. It means that we played our part, we did what we had to do, but perhaps we could have done a lot more, that\u2019s what I mean, perhaps our best was not good enough.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about your generation now?\n\nYes, and personally too, I don\u2019t excuse myself\n\nTimes are changing now, and a couple of more young Nigerians are taking over the affairs of the country and they want to be involved in politics. What do you think they would need to do differently?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that can be done, but because this is an interview, I\u2019ll like to just state 3 of these things that can be done.\n\nThe first is funding. We live in a country where half of the population, sharply divided, are extremely poor people. What I mean by extremely poor people is, these are people that can hardly afford three square meals a day. These are people who don\u2019t have enough money to live a life of luxury. Where entering a cab is a thing of luxury, you have to enter buses every day. These are people who find it hard to access great indicators of healthcare or education. So what I\u2019ll tell young people is make that money first and ensure that your skills bring you money, ensure that you\u2019re able to get disposable income to push towards your passion.\n\nIf you look at the EndSARS protest and the monies that were raised by either FEMCO (Feminist Coalition) or other groups, that was a lot of money. If the groups that raised those money didn\u2019t have disposable income, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise the money. Ensure that you have enough disposable income, that\u2019s one, it means that whoever wants to weaponise poverty, whoever wants to use your needs and wants against you would fail woefully if you\u2019re able to have your own income.\n\nNumber two, you need to learn about governance, you need to learn about civics, you need to learn about democracy. You can\u2019t just assume because you have a degree or because you have studied abroad that you understand how government work, you need to understand how parliament work, you need to understand lobby, you need to understand how pressure groups work, you need to understand how to court the media, you need to understand framing your grievances, you need to understand framing your advocacy, you need to be able to understand psychology of politicians, psychology of government, the psychology of Nigerian politics and its various components. You need to be able to speak the language of the oppressor; you need to be able to speak the language of people in government; you need to level up with them if you are going to go into mainstream party politics, go in and do it from within. If you\u2019re going to be a critic, ensure that you totally understand the issue at hand, you know the terms and terminologies; you know the right registers, ensure that you have adequate knowledge of what you want to do. People like Adetola who ran the legal arm of the EndSARS; if you look at what they did, these people are lawyers, some of them trained in Nigeria, some of them trained abroad and they understand the Nigerian legal system. That is why the people arrested got out within a very short period because they understood the law, they understood the right to assemble, the right to protest, they understood all of these things, so if you understand the language of government, if you understand the language of politics then you\u2019ll be cultivated, you\u2019ll go through the process of the framework that have been laid down and you\u2019ll put in the work and follow it to a logical conclusion and these are where you earn your stripes.\n\nLastly, we need to build consensus and partnership across ethnicities, across religious lines, across geopolitical zones. We need to build a consensus; we need to find like-minded individuals across the country. It\u2019s not enough to come on Twitter and insult the people of the south and insult the people of the southwest and insult the people of the northwest and insult people of the northeast. We need to look for areas of convergence and say okay, you know what, at the end of the day what I assume you go through and what I go through is all the same, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re speaking it in a different language, but you and I, north or west, east or south, we\u2019re all one, we\u2019re all members of this entity called Nigeria. If I understand you and you understand me, we can be able to build a stronger, more understandable consensus.\n\nThis consensus is what the politicians are better at doing than us, the politicians fight in the afternoon on national television, and at night they pat their backs then further seek on how they\u2019ll capture our common wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than six months since the EndSARS protest, what can you say about the protest? What is your view regarding the arguments that the youth overstayed their welcome?\n\nI have a quote from Zora Neale Hurston where she says \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about your pains, they\u2019ll kill you and say that you enjoyed dying\u201d.\n\nAs regards the EndSARS protest, it\u2019s a tragedy how the protest ended with a lot of lost lives and properties. But I think it\u2019s a milestone in the contemporary political issue of Nigeria, I think the young people had their baptism of fire on how the Nigerian state operates. I must say that it was an idea that had come of age.\n\nHowever, the government made consension in my mind and this is what I have told some people who were at the forefront of the movement. Even though they said that they had no leaders, they were people who were at the forefront and my argument was; now that the government was making consension, why don\u2019t you listen to them? Why don\u2019t you try one foot in one foot out? Why don\u2019t you try to just listen?\n\nThe difference between EndSARS protest and other protests is in the make-up of the people who were doing the protesting. Most protests in Nigeria are usually by civil servants, usually led by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), so the longevity is always kind, these people cannot remain on the street for too long because they need to go back to work because the government will appease labour leaders and labour leaders will have no choice but to come to the table.\n\nEvery crisis ends in two ways, either it ends in anarchy or it ends in the negotiating table. We do not want it to end in anarchy because you and I can lose our lives. If we end up at the negotiation table, there\u2019ll be give and take, and therein lies very little successes that will come up another day.\n\nSo in my mind the government was willing to negotiate, those at the forefront should have taken the lead to go in and negotiate with the government. However, there is a trust-deficit, we never trust each other because of what had happened in the past. But like I said, I\u2019ll rather end at the negotiating table than end in anarchy. At the end of the day whether it was criticized anarchy, whether it was organized anarchy, it still ended in anarchy. Very tragic what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. Some people I believe lost their lives, some people lost their limbs, it was needless; It wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way .\n\nAt least later we saw rampaging youths, looting, looting courts, vandalizing public utilities, all of that were needless , you know they were needless, all of these were avoidable, we also saw similar things in Abuja but in my mind all of this were very much avoidable, if both parties had come to the table at the right time. it may not be a popular opinion, but this is my opinion.\n\n",

          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 13\n\n\u201cThey brought out two girls from the van and asked for money, those that didn\u2019t have money were all raped by the police, anyone that paid was allowed to go and from the van, if you had no money you\u2019d be raped before they left you go off the van.\u201d\n\nWhen Cynthia (name has been changed) went out with a group of her friends in Abuja on April 26, 2019, she probably envisaged a nice Friday night out with the girls after a hard week at work. Like many other single women living in Abuja, Cynthia was attracted to the relatively dynamic economy and vibrant, cosmopolitan lifestyle available in the federal capital. Unlike many other places in Nigeria where simply coming out at night is an extreme sport, the seat of Nigeria\u2019s federal government offered a semblance of normalcy.\n\nThe group of friends settled for a club called \u2018Cloud 9\u2019 at the Nadrem Emporium on 3rd Avenue, Gwarimpa. Suddenly the party was broken up by a large group of men who barged in, demanding that Cynthia and her friends stand up and follow them outside immediately. When they naturally resisted this unwanted intrusion on their evening outing, they were dragged outside along with the other women in the club. Outside they saw a convoy of law enforcement and armed forces vehicles including police, NSCDC, army, immigration and even the prisons service.\n\nNadrem Cloud 9 where Cynthia\u2019s ordeal began: Source \u2013 Google Maps\n\nCynthia didn\u2019t know it yet, but this would be the start of a 4-day ordeal in the hands of the police at the behest of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), a hitherto little-known agency which has since gained a fearsome reputation in the city, for its singular commitment to rape, extortion and harassment of young women. Over the ensuing 96 hours, she and at least 70 other young female detainees were tear gassed in a locked police cell, denied food, water or sanitary provisions and raped by police officers if they could not pay for their freedom.\n\nTheir crime?\n\nApparently existing while female in Abuja.\n\ncynthia describes how it all began\n\nAbuja\u2019s Targeted Female Raids: Officially Sanctioned Rape and Extortion Racketeering\n\nWhile putting this story together, I spoke to six different victims of these raids, all of whom came from markedly different backgrounds and circumstances. While Cynthia was hanging out with her friends Patricia, Mary and Judith at a club (all names have been changed), Mercy was standing at the roadside waiting for a \u201ckeke\u201d while Peace was at a hotel for a friend\u2019s birthday. None of these women was doing anything particularly out of the ordinary, much less wrong. Yet they all had more or less the same story, give or take a few details.\n\nTo continue telling under-reported stories, we need your support for the work we do by donating to https://paystack.com/pay/newswirengr\n\nMercy was accosted while waiting for a keke and abducted by a group of touts working for the AEPB. From going about her normal business, she found herself in police detention facing verbal and physical violence for no reason at all in the space of a few minutes. Even worse as she said to my mounting amazement, she has been abducted under similar circumstances three times this year alone. For added incredulity, she revealed that on one such occasion, she was taken to the FCT High Court at Zuba and instructed to plead guilty to whatever she was charged with, lest she risk going to Suleja prison.\n\nMy mouth nearly fell open when she said that she actually did so. Apparently, it really was a choice between pleading guilty to a nonsensical charge or finding herself remanded in a notorious prison in Niger State \u2013 for absolutely no reason. It did not escape my notice that this practise of scaring innocent people into pleading guilty to charges they do not understand could mean that a significant population of Suleja prison probably consists of innocent young women abducted from the streets of Abuja and forced to plead guilty to\u2026anything including murder, terrorism and robbery.\n\nMercy got off fairly lightly, because she was charged only with \u201ccausing nuisance\u201d \u2013 an offense which, while completely nonsensical, at least let her regain her freedom immediately. Peace on the other hand, was not so lucky. Of all the victims; horrible stories, hers perhaps was the most pitiful of the bunch because of how unlikely it was. A regular middle-class professional working a 9-5 job, she was lodged in her hotel room celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday when she decided to buy water from the reception. Nobody answered the intercom, so she stepped out of her room to go downstairs herself. She did not even lock the door.\n\nDescribing what happened next she said:\n\n\n\nImmediately I got to the reception, one woman came and held my hands and insisted that I should follow her and I was like \u201cMa, what happened?\u201d She then said I should just respect myself and follow her, she continued dragging me until when we got outside, I saw cameras and a large crowd with people videoing with their phones, I saw so many hilux [sic] with police, immigration civil defence, military, etc. They were just so many along with touts in reflective jackets. I saw other girls being dragged into the buses. They even went to the extent of knocking the hotel rooms, they will knock the hotel doors and if you open the door and you happen to be a lady, they will drag you out of the rooms into the buses, it got to one girl, they did not only drag her out of the hotel room, they dragged her and pull her clothes before the cameras and took a naked picture of her, they took her clothes off and she was naked and took pictures of her.\u201d\n\npeace\n\n\n\nThe Curious Case of \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d Mastermind Behind the Abduction of Abuja women\n\nThrough the course of the difficult conversations with all six women, one name kept coming up persistently as a chief protagonist of the newfangled rule-of-rape regime \u2013 a certain \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d A search on Google reveals some important things about this person. First of all, she appears to be a ghost. Despite currently being a high profile public servant in the nation\u2019s capital, Acting Secretary to the FCT Social Development Secretariat (SDS) Hajiya Safiya Umar, alias \u201cHajiya Safiya\u201d has no pictures online, in the time honoured tradition of human rights luminaries like Col. Frank Omenka.\n\nSecond, Mrs. Umar appears to be something of a hypocrite. She is on record for criticising Senator Elisha Abbo for assaulting a woman in July this year. Three months before that episode however, she directly and openly coordinated one of the worst human rights violations in the history of Nigerian democracy. Under her instruction, hundreds of women including nursing mothers were raped, assaulted, kidnapped and unlawfully detained in filthy conditions. She continues to defend her actions, while publicly condemning a woman-beater.\n\nI mentioned that to properly contextualise the type of human being Mrs. Umar is, to all intents and purposes. One of those people.\n\nan encounter with \u201chajiya safiya\u201d\n\nCynthia\u2019s description of her encounter with Hajiya Safiya mentioned that while she was lucky enough to get out on Friday night, she came back on Saturday morning to bail out her friends, only to be thrown into the cell on the orders of this \u201cHajiya Safiya.\u201d Describing how it happened, she told me that upon getting to the station, she spotted a livid woman only known as \u201cHajiya Safiya,\u201d who wanted to know why the police granted bail to some of the girls from the previous night\u2019s raid. The lady did not want to know how the police did it, but she had one simple message for them:\n\n\u201cGET THOSE GIRLS BACK!\u201d hajiya safiya umar\n\n\n\n\u201cget those girls back!\u201d\n\nDue to the sheer misfortune of being present at the police station then, Cynthia was promptly rearrested, notwithstanding the N3,000 she had already paid to bail herself out the previous night \u2013 a sum that was not refunded to her.. Later that night, the police went out again on Hajiya Safiya\u2019s orders, abducting and detaining more women including a nursing mother with a two-month old baby.\n\nWhen she appeared before the National Human Rights Commission on May 16 to explain the events of April 26, Mrs. Umar delivered the dismissive, nauseatingly self-righteous performance typical of Nigerian public office holders who think they are doing the country a favour by being in office. Responding to the well-established and widespread reports of rape and brutality that accompanied the Abuja raids, she flatly denied them and conveniently feigned ignorance of any such possibility. Presumably, it was a stretch to imagine that the famously professional and well-behaved lower ranks of the police could do such things when given free reign and assisted by civilian touts.\n\nIn between the gratuitous dishonesty though, she did freely admit to being one of the principal brains behind the April raids that launched the AEPB into its ferocious new phase of existence as a sort of female-focused SARS. In her view, these raids were necessary to tackle \u201csocial vices\u201d like prostitution. In practise, that means carrying out the fool\u2019s errand of trying to group young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d\n\nOne might imagine that the Acting Secretary to the SDS \u2013 an institution that supposedly exists to help vulnerable women and children \u2013 would have a more nuanced and intelligent view of the world. Researching Hajiya Umar revealed however, that she has all the nuance and finesse of a chainsaw in a hardwood forest. To her, everything she considers a problem must be chopped down forthwith. Like prostitutes. Especially prostitutes. Actually only prostitutes. Also whoever she decides is a prostitute. Did I mention prostitute?\n\nProstitute.\n\nAccording to her, the SDS and the AEPB collaboration was to preserve the \u201cnorms and values\u201d of society, or at least the subjective ideas thereof held by she and her colleagues. In the face of several women who recounted their traumatising and dehumanising experiences, Mrs. Umar denied that any such things could have happened, even though she also admitted that she had left the police station before the women were released \u2013 so she obviously had no way of confirming that.\n\nI was at Nadrem for a birthday and all of a sudden we saw some guys asking ladies to stand up and one guy walked up to me and insisted I should stand up, he said common will you stand up there, he then came and dragged me, inserting his hands in my buttocks in his attempts to drag me he was putting his hand in my ass and pressing my buttocks, and this was the hired touts they brought along to harass us. patricia\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as everyone struggles to identify precisely what \u201cnorms and values\u201d Mrs. Umar and her syndicate are \u201cpreserving\u201d in the federal capital by running an industrial harassment of women (with some repeatedly raped by Police) and extortion machine, it is very important to note that these raids were not a one-off event. They had been happening before April, albeit on a smaller scale, and they are still happening now, six months later. I may have addressed the stories of my six sources using the past tense, but the risk of abduction, sexual harrassment, rape, torture and wrongful imprisonment is very much a present and ongoing risk for young women in Abuja.\n\nJudith describes how targeted sexual HARASSMENT of young women in abuja continues to this day\n\nBanana seller, office worker, shop owner, teenager, 30-something year-old, single, married \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. Young women in Nigeria\u2019s federal capital are now fair game for Safiya Umar and her motley crue of sexual perverts, rapists, sadists and dirty cops to do absolutely whatever they want to, with no consequences. Hajiya Safiya belongs to a school of binary thought that divides all young women into \u201cprostitutes\u201d and \u201cnot prostitutes.\u201d Apparently if you are a young woman in Abuja right now, who dares to breathe oxygen and exhibit bipedal motion, Hajiya Umar thinks you are a prostitute. And since you are a prostitute, you clearly deserve to be abducted, raped and extorted \u2013 maybe even killed.\n\nThe Unanswered Legal and Political Questions\n\nAmid the outrage that surrounded the initial story of the AEPB raids earlier in the year, something that repeatedly kept coming up was the possibility that the AEPB was actually acting under the legal remit of what we euphemistically call the \u2018Penal Codes\u2019 \u2013 Sharia Law, to those who don\u2019t know. The idea that Sharia Law could be enforced in opposition to the country\u2019s national constitution in the federal capital did not make any sense to me, so I took professional legal advice from a respected friend and colleague who would be in a position to know. His answer was short and simple.\n\n\u201cActually, the Penal Code is supposed to be subject to the constitution, which could always be interpreted to supersede such provisions.\u201d Fifehan Ogunde PhD, Senior legal consultant, wemimo ogunde & co\n\n\n\nIn other words, we can discount legal backing from the Sharia penal codes as the basis for Hajiya Safiya\u2019s FCT rape gang. At best, there is a measure of ambiguity about whether or not these penal codes can be enforced where they contradict the constitution directly, but there is simply no legal basis at all for having a gang of brutal rapists masquerading as a sort of morality police outfit, terrorising young women in their 20s and 30s across the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThus in addition to merely being morally abominable, grotesque and disgusting, Hajiya Safiya\u2019s rape-enhanced war on Abuja\u2019s women is also plainly illegal. She is breaking the law and so she and her gang of morality rapists must be stopped and held to account immediately. In any case, the point is moot, because surely Sharia law does not prescribe rape as a punishment for boarding a keke or attending a birthday party or going for a night out with friends.\n\nFrom a political perspective, what is playing out in Abuja right now at the behest of Safiya Umar and her colleagues is also more than just a group of officially-sanctioned gangsters organising an extortion racket, as is usually the case elsewhere in Nigeria. Hajiya Umar plainly fancies herself a champion of a notoriously parochial ethnoreligious elite with designs on remolding the Nigerian State and Nigerian society at large in the image of a terrified feudal society with a small everlasting elite and a sprawling, unquestioning everlasting underclass.\n\nTo this end, Hajiya Umar\u2019s SDS and their brutal AEPB enforcers are testing the waters through the blatant illegality of subjecting Nigeria\u2019s capital to an undemocratic pseudo-dictatorship and an accompanying culture of sexual violence to instill fear, shame and silence in a population that does not satisfy her cultural expectations. It is no coincidence that this is happening alongside the ongoing SARS menace because as with all wannabe dictators who have no capacity to lead independent, vocal and confident populations hungry for more democracy, the strategy is to break the spirit of the young people.\n\nIt is important to understand that kite-flying about so-called penal codes, AEPB-facilitated mass rapes, abductions, extortions and gratuitous violence are not mere by-products of Hajiya Umar\u2019s social cleansing campaign \u2013 they are the point. The policy direction of the SDS and the AEPB is now determined by a mafia with a blatant and undisguised cultural agenda seeking to modify Nigeria\u2019s federal capital into something closer in character to Gusau or Damaturu.\n\nThe good people of Gusau and Damaturu are no doubt happy enough with their societal arrangement, as the people of Benin, Jos, Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and Abuja are with theirs. Nigeria is nothing if not a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi religious and generally heterogeneous country. One of the best things about Abuja historically is that it is one of the few truly cosmopolitan melting pots in Nigeria, which is how it attracts Nigeria\u2019s best talent away from the afore-mentioned urban centres.\n\nUsing vicious sexual violence as a vehicle, Hajiya Safiya Umar and her co-travelers are slowly but deliberately destroying the social and cultural fabric of Nigeria\u2019s second most important city. This must be robustly challenged and blocked at every turn. Abuja is Nigeria\u2019s federal capital territory. It does not belong to Safiya Umar, neither does it belong to the gang of uniformed and civilian rapists she is willfully and knowingly empowering in pursuit of a parochial, anachronistic agenda. We need to remind people like Mrs. Umar that whether they like it or not, Nigeria is not \u2013 and can never be \u2013 the feudal society of their fantasies. My starting suggestion for doing this is simple: take a picture of her and thus demystify the ghost behind the rapists.\n\nIn so doing, we will once again reaffirm that Abuja belongs to all Nigerians from all 930,000+ sq km of this country, including Cynthia, Peace, Mercy, Judith, Patricia, Mary, and every other young Nigerian woman.\n\n\u201cI want Justice, If they\u2019re pursuing us in another country, they\u2019d now be pursuing us in our own country also. we are Nigerians why will they be treating us like we don\u2019t deserve rights?\u201d Judith\n\n\n\nPatricia\u2019s frustration",

          "title": "Isa Ali Pantami \u2013 The Inside Story of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications & Digital Economy",
          "text": "Estimated Reading Time: 12\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami is the proverbial chameleon with one eye on the past and one eye on the future. Depending on the situation or who is involved in it, he sometimes comes across as a cosmopolitan technocrat with a strong academic background. At other times, he transforms into a knuckle-dragging troglodyte spewing forth parochial religious and micro-ethnic sentiments.\n\nPerhaps because of the sheer disconnect between the different Isa Pantamis known to different people, it has always been difficult to conclusively nail him down to a singular identity. To those who work around him or watch him on television delivering speeches about Nigeria\u2019s broadband masterplan in his trademark reedy voice, it can be very disorienting to process the idea that this slightly built man with the gold-rimmed prescription glasses could be on of the most dangerous men in Nigeria right now.\n\nEven after extensively-researched exposes about the furious and unrepentant religious extremist that resides somewhere within Isa Pantami\u2019s polite exterior, it is simply difficult for many to accept. How is it possible that this man with a PhD from Aberdeen and several certificate programs at the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions is also a supporter of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as an instigator of deadly religious crises in Northern Nigeria?\n\nAfter reading Sheikh Pantami\u2019s mealy-mouthed attempt to distance himself from his own utterances during a Ramadan service on Saturday April 17, 2021, I decided that the best way to break through his manufactured genteel posturing and lift the veil of denial is not to write another extensively-sourced 2,000-word deep dive, but rather to let Pantami himself do the work for us.\n\nPro-Terrorist Rhetoric and a Buhari Cameo\n\nThe man who would later become \u201cSheikh,\u201d \u201cImam,\u201d \u201cMallam\u201d and \u201cDr\u201d Isa Pantami was born on October 20, 1972 in the Pantami Ward of Gombe State. Pantami Ward is noted for being the last holdout of the infamous Maitatsine Islamic uprisings of the 1980s. Some have argued that these uprisings were in fact precursors to the Boko Haram crisis that would follow 2 decades later.\n\nIt is impossible to verify whether the adolescent Pantami was ideologically influenced by the Maitatsine-type Islamic cult which grew in Pantami Ward and culminated in a bloody showdown with authorities on April 29, 1985. What we do know for sure about Pantami is that after graduating in 2003 from the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU) in Bauchi with a BTech in Computer Science, he became the Chief Imam at ATBU and an influential public figure in Bauchi.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, roughly one month shy of his 34th birthday, Pantami delivered a now-infamous public lecture in Bauchi titled \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u201d (\u201cWho Are The Taliban?). This was just one several incendiary sermons and public lectures that Imam Pantami delivered over the course of nearly a decade in Bauchi, but the reason it has now become infamous is because it found its way onto the internet. First Italian academic Dr. Andrea Brigaglia of the University of Cape Town Centre for Contemporary Islam published a paper in 2019 with a translation of the question-and-answer segment of \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban.\u2019 Then a 54-minute audio recording of the lecture mysteriously turned up on a Nigerian Islamic community website.\n\nBy luck or by design, \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 has now become the proverbial bone stuck in Isa Pantami\u2019s throat. At first he denied making such pronouncements outright. Then when the audio recording with his unmistakable voice showed up, he claimed that Dr. Brigaglia\u2019s translation was inaccurate, suggesting that whoever translated it either did not understand Hausa properly, or simply did not like him. Several influential friends of the house eagerly went to work with this narrative, attempting to take advantage of the fact that most Nigerians who have a keen interest in this story are not (native) Hausa speakers.\n\nTo establish whether there was any truth in this narrative, I collaborated with a trusted contact who was born and raised in northern Nigeria and is a native Hausa speaker. Passing across the 54-minute audio recording, I tasked him with extracting 4 parts of the recording that confirm or refute Brigaglia\u2019s translation of what Pantami said 15 years ago. For the first time since the story broke, I can present 4 accurately translated and carefully subtitled extracts from \u2018Suwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 that tell a very clear story about who 33 year-old Isa Pantami was.\n\nIn the first extract below, Pantami describes the Afghan Taliban in glowing terms, saying that they have undergone \u201ctrials from Allah\u201d while dealing with kafuri (\u201cinfidels\u201d) from the Western world who wish to destroy the \u201cgood image\u201d of the Taliban.\n\nThe transcript for the segment above, taken from 2:50 \u2013 3:57 of the full recording reads:\n\n\u201cWith respect to enquiries/clarification on this topic, I decided to respond timely so as to underscore the importance of the Topic to the people. A very important thought that came into my mind, is that what our brethren-Al Sunnah (Salafists) want to know is how the Talibans who lived in Afghanistan were subjected to trials from Allah on this earth. Subjected to a test of faith and love.\n\nFurthermore, there were a group of people, Infidels, from the Western World, who don\u2019t have any other target in this life except to destroy the good image of the Talibans in the eyes of their Muslim brethren, to destroy the Taliban image even in the eyes of the Infidels themselves, by means of accusing the Taliban of deeds which were not committed by them.\n\nThe next extract is taken from 13:14 \u2013 15:19 of the full recording.\n\n\u201cThe Land of Afghanistan was in a terrible state until the Monarchy was abolished, that is Kingship System, exactly around 1978 Christian Era. If you did arithmetic, you\u2019d notice that about 30 years had gone by. Afghanistan found itself in a state of anarchy to the extent that the infidels began to plan on coming in and dominating Afghanistan. This is because when you are religiously pious, patient, worshipping God, reading the Quran, our adversaries- the Infidels, especially the United States of America are always distressed. As such, they are always lurking around and looking for an opportunity ar launching an attack against you. Right now, they are claiming to be super powers, whereas the USSR was formerly the World Power.\n\nUnder the pretext of promoting peace,The USA invaded Afghanistan. Their entry into the country was characterised by their support for one group against the other. Right now, if Allah were to bring a test of faith on Nigeria, who do you think would be the first to invade Nigeria? AMERICA! If they invaded, who do you think they would support? Muslims or Infidels? INFIDELS! This is exactly how they seek to operate. This is the reason why in the rules of Islam, it is wrong to take premature action without making Preparation (Istidhad). This is the path of God\u2019s Religion.\u201d\n\nApart from Pantami\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201ckafuri\u201d (infidel) to refer to non-Muslims, the important thing to note about this extract is that the inference in the second paragraph is that not only are Muslims at war with the USA by default, but that the only reason they should not \u201ctake action\u201d, i.e a violent jihad is that if the USA intervened, it would side with non-Muslims. This is an important point because it ties closely with the \u201cgradualist\u201d philosophy propagated by Al-Qaeda, whereby emphasis is placed on preparation, typically through political means, instead of simple confrontation favoured by the likes of ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nIn the next segment taken from 17:28 \u2013 17:51, Pantami makes a nudge-wink reference to \u201cMr. Zero Zero\u201d (a northern Nigerian reference to Rt. Gen Muhammadu Buhari) being a \u201ctrue Muslim\u201d and hence his preferred candidate in the upcoming (2007) elections.\n\n\u201cThey have a plan of invading and dominating Afghanistan, so as to impose whatever they like on its Government. All along, this is their strategy all over the World, where any Nation of Infidels that is powerful can impose themselves on any other country. This is why we have been praying to Almighty Allah to urgently bring Mr Zero-Zero to Power in Nigeria. May Almighty Allah give us a true Muslim who fears Almighty Allah. I\u2019m sure that you all know who I\u2019m referring to, I don\u2019t need to elaborate.\u201c\n\n[Audience responds]: \u201cYes!\u201c\n\nFor reference, the main candidates in the 2007 general election were Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua (PDP), Muhammadu Buhari (ANPP) and Atiku Abubakar (AC). Yar\u2019adua eventually won with 24.6 million votes to Buhari\u2019s 6 million votes and Atiku\u2019s 2.6 million votes. This is the first clue in the story of Isa Pantami that hints at a longstanding relationship with Nigeria\u2019s current president.\n\nThe fourth and final extract taken from 52:35 \u2013 53:21 contains a chilling set of prayers that directly instigate Pantami\u2019s audience against the Nigerian state in a manner not dissimilar to that of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAnd therefore, we are praying to God, that based on our understanding, we pray for a day when the images on the notes in our pockets will be removed. No Muslim Cleric has ever spoken against this images as forbidden. May we be self-sufficient enough not to need this currency. It is against the Religion to put even the images of the Companions of the Prophet on the currency. May Allah help us to see that day when the Gregorian date, the Calendar of the Infidels that is on the notes is removed. And that day is coming when it will certainly be removed.\u201d\n\nA Case Study in Dissembling, Dishonesty and Disingenuousness\n\nSince the audio recording emerged, making it difficult to deny and obfuscate any longer, Pantami has changed tack. In a Q&A segment during his daily Ramadan lecture at Annor Mosque in Abuja on Saturday April 17, 2021, Pantami said:\n\n\u201cSome of the comments I made some years ago that are generating controversies now were based on my understanding of religious issues at the time, and I have changed several positions taken in the past based on new evidence and maturity. I was young when I made some of the comments; I was in university, some of the comments were made when I was a teenager. I started preaching when I was 13, many scholars and individuals did not understand some of international events and therefore took some positions based on their understanding, some have come to change their positions later. \u2013 Isa Pantami responding to questions about his jihadist preachings\n\nThis statement is important because it shows that Pantami relies of the credulity and lack of research of his audience to get away with his everlasting chameleon act of constant reinvention without accountability. Pantami is clearly expecting his audience to take to heart the emotionally believable tale of a \u201cteenager\u201d or \u201c13 year-old\u201d being \u201cimmature\u201d and misled. In fact, \u201cSuwaye Yan Taliban\u2019 was delivered in 2006 when Pantami was 33 \u2013 14 years older than the oldest possible teenager..\n\nUnderstanding this type of dishonesty is central to unraveling the Isa Pantami myth and lifting the layers of carefully constructed falsehoods and misdirection that one of Nigeria\u2019s most dangerous individuals uses to conceal himself. Here is another example of Pantami being disingenuous, this time in response to a question about his ouster as Chief Imam at ATBU:\n\nA solid answer to a question nobody asked.\n\nReading this answer, you would think that Pantami has directly denied the story referenced in a 2009 Wikileaks cable about his unceremonious ouster from ATBU. In fact however, he has cleverly danced around the question which was \u201cWere you thrown out as Chief Imam at ATBU after formenting a series of religious crises in the community?\u201d Instead he provided an answer to \u201cWere you thrown out of ATBU as a student?\u201d A fine answer it was \u2013 but not an answer to the question. He fully expects his audience to lack the mental rigour to spot this obvious disingenuousness, which enables him to escape being pinned down on anything.\n\nWhen all else fails, the second tactic Pantami employs is to issue vigorous, bloviating denials, often lying through his teeth. An example of this is his May 2020 fallout with NIDCOM Chair Abike Dabiri-Erewa, where armed men acting on is orders forcefully evicted she and her staff from their office at the NCC. While Dabiri-Erewa was very clear and forthright about what happened, with several eyewitnesses corroborating her account of events, Pantami had this to say:\n\nTHIS IS A FAT LIE FROM HER: The owner of the building @NgComCommission has faulted her lies on their social media platforms. The minister has never given that directives to any gunman. We need to be very objective in reporting. I have never sent any gunmen there, & I have no one https://t.co/SUi3n4Qs4E \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) May 24, 2020\n\nA clear parallel can be drawn with his recent reaction to stories about his presence on a US terror watchlist. Of course he knew better than anyone that with the record he has and the extensive intelligence network operated by the NSA, CIA and FBI, it is almost impossible for someone like him to not be on such a watchlist. For that matter, he also knew that it is impossible to fact check such a story because the intelligence agencies involved will never voluntarily divulge such information. Yet here he was in true bloviating Pantami fashion \u2013 strutting for his audience and basking in a phantom win before completely reversing himself a few days later and claiming that it was all the fault of his misguided teenage self.\n\n1) @NewsWireNGR your RETRACTION through your independent investigation,has been noted. However, investigative journalism requires the investigation before publishing, not after.\n\nFurther, major publishers will meet my lawyers in the court on this defamation of character. https://t.co/08W3dP4tlf \u2014 Isa Ali Pantami, PhD (@DrIsaPantami) April 12, 2021\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore\u201d \u2013\n\nMost blatantly of all, Pantami\u2019s declaration that he no longer agrees with his jihadi iteration from 2006 is demonstrably false, and this can be easily proven. Here is just one example. On March 22, 2021, Pantami\u2019s Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy hosted a virtual flag-off ceremony for a capacity development programme empowering 600 people with VSAT Installation Skills. Pantami himself was in attendance and he spoke at the event.\n\nOngoing!\n\n\n\nVirtual Flag-off of Capacity Development Programme on\n\nVSAT Installation Skills and TVRO Systems for 600 Youths by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, @DrIsaPantami\n\n\n\nTo watch LIVE, Click on link ? belowhttps://t.co/c1nogsNyAh#DigitalNigeria \u2014 Fed Ministry of Communications & Digital Economy (@FMoCDENigeria) March 22, 2021\n\nThis would all seem very run-of-the-mill and prosaic until you click on the YouTube link in the tweet. Was it livestreamed by the FMCoDE\u2019s YouTube channel? No. Was it livestreamed by the NTA YouTube channel? No. Channels TV? No. TVC? No. AIT? No. No major broadcaster was engaged to livestream this event hosted by Pantami\u2019s Ministry. Instead, a little-known Islamic TV channel called Al-Afrikiy was contracted to relay an event organised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to point out that Al-Afrikiy is not merely an Islamic-influenced, or Islamic-leaning TV station which also covers other things. Al-Afrikiy is an Islam-only TV channel. It broadcasts strictly religious content. Getting this channel to host an FMCoDE event would be the equivalent of getting TB Joshua\u2019s Emmanuel TV to host an official Federal Government event.\n\nan islam-only tv channel somehow got to host pantami\u2019s fmcode event\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nAl-Afrikiy is not just an Islam-only TV channel. Its social media handles also get involved in religious controversies, as proven by this post from its Facebook page.\n\nThis is the sort of outfit hired to broadcast FG events now apparently\n\nA look through Al-Afrikiy\u2019s YouTube uploads shows that this channel uploads exclusively religious content, with only 2 exceptions. The 2 of them have something in common which readers will immediately spot.\n\nNotice anything?\n\nHere too\u2026\n\nBut wait. It gets even worse.\n\nI looked up the website link on Al-Afrikiy\u2019s Facebook page. I wanted to get a sense for what kind of no-name religion-only channel somehow gets the inside track on broadcasting events by a federal ministry \u2013 a contract that I know for a fact actual TV broadcasters would bite off Pantami\u2019s hand for. This was what I saw:\n\nPantami\u2019s \u201cFederal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy\u201d has its events relayed by an unknown Islamic TV station without a functioning website.\n\nIn case you\u2019re still thinking \u201cNo way, there has to be an explanation. Pantami cannot be so openly parochial as to give federal broadcasting gigs to an Islamic version of Emmanuel TV, here is what Al-Afrikiy itself has to say about the kind of programming it does.\n\nI rest my case here.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIt is the policy of NewsWireNGR not to endorse or oppose any opinion expressed by a User or Content provided by a User, Contributor, or other independent party.

We all have to be vigilant and \u2018say something when we see something\u2019. You are your first security. It starts with the individual and more than before, we must be thoroughly and extremely observant\u201d.\n\nThe First Lady described Ramadan as a period that emphasised the virtues of love, tolerance, forgiveness, brotherhood, sacrifice, self-denial, piety and generosity among others, urging the people to imbibe the lessons of the holy month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer words: \u201cBeyond Ramadan, it is important for us to imbibe and sustain the principles of the holy month which, among others include peace, kindness, compassion and happy co-existence. The holy Prophet held these principles in high esteem and lived his whole life around them\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must allow all these virtues to be reflected in our actions, public conduct and interpersonal relationship with everyone around us. This way, we will improve on the cordial relationship that exists among the various ethnic groups and adherents of different religions in our State\u201d, she said\n\nDelivering a Lecture at the event titled, \u201cLessons of Ramadan: Panacea for Peace and Development\u201d, Sheikh (Dr.) Abdul Hakeem Lawal, Chief Missioner, Ikhwanu Muslimun called on Lagosians to be involved in governance.\n\nHe underscored the need to give godly and developmental advice to those in the position of leadership and avoid unhealthy criticism of government policies, plans and programmes.\n\nDr. Lawal commended the present administration for always making wide consultation in all of its plans, stressing that government is not about \u201cdoing what you think is right but doing what the people want\u201d, which this administration under Governor Sanwo-Olu is already doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresent at the event were top government functionaries, Islamic scholars and Imams from the five divisions of the State.",

At the end of the one-day consultative meeting, the Forum, issued the following Communique.\n\n1. The meeting called on Mr President as the Chief Executive Officer of Nigeria and Commander in Chief of Nigerian Armed Forces to immediately send an Executive Bill to the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Constitution to devolve more powers to the States with respect to security arrangements culminating in some form of State Policing and the general security architecture.\n\n2. In the interim, Mr President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr President and all State Governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing. The meeting agreed that the Police Force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\n\n3. The meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders / farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria.\n\n4. The meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages. To this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC Government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country, and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\n\n6. The meeting thanked the Host Governor, His Excellency, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State for being a gracious and wonderful host, and congratulated him for the many landmark developmental projects he has executed, and urged him to continue to work with all stakeholders in the South West Zone to ensure that PDP takes over majority of the States in the Zone.\n\nIn attendance are:\n\nRt.

The second sacking was 2,000.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that in the Primary Healthcare Development Agency, 1,700 workers were sacked. We are aware in SUBEB, 4000 workers were sacked. We are also aware that the list of 11,000 workers is ready.\n\n\u201cHe (the governor) claimed he had not reverted salaries of workers to N18,000. We are aware that out of the 31, 000 workers in the state he did not pay 20,000 of them.\n\nIn fact those he paid three days ago in the Local Government were given N18000. These are the facts and those workers are here to confirm\u201d, the NLC President said.\n\nWabba also condemned the governor for increasing school fees by 1000% after sacking workers.\n\nAccording to Wabba, \u201cthe governor increased the school fees by 1000% and I have on authority that 70% of the students of Kaduna State University (KASU) are indigenes of the state.\n\n\u201cThey are also children of workers , pensioners, petty traders. What type of system do we want to run?\n\n\u201cIs it not the same governor that benefited from public school from primary school to university with bursary, yet we are claiming that there is insecurity in the land.\n\n\u201cHow can we not have insecurity?\n\n\u201cWe have on record that those 21,000 teachers that were sacked (in 2017) were not paid.\n\n\u201cAnd if he (the governor) claim that he has paid, tomorrow, I will invite all of them to be here with their letters.\n\n\u201cThis is where we are! Why should public officers, especially, people that are expected to hold governance in trust now lie to the public?\n\nHe also dismissed claims that that the NLC was invited for a meeting on Sunday, saying it is false.\n\nWabba said: \u201cHow can a government that earned the trust of the people to be elected now be deceiving the people.\n\n\u201cThis is the real situation in the state that is why you can see the action is fully complied.\n\n\u201cRail has been put on hold power supply has been stopped, petroleum stations are not dispensing, banks are closed, railway from Kaduna to Abuja has been stopped, the airport has been closed, yet we have somebody that is tyrant that will say that he is fighting. \u201cThis is to tell all of us that the situation in Nigeria cannot change, the situation in Kaduna state cannot change unless we are able to take our destinies in our hands.\u201d\n\nThe labour leader also said claims by the state government about a subsisting warrant in 2017 for his arrest is false, maintaining that he had visited Kaduna more than 20 times.\n\n\u201cThe governor realised that our courts have been shut down because of their actions and inactions and he issued false information that he acquired an order about four years ago to arrest us, are we in a Banana republic?\n\n\u201cIf he had an order four years ago, I have come to Kaduna more than 20 times.\n\n\u201cSo if the sayer is a fool, the listeners cannot be fooled.\n\n\u201cHe never promised that he will sack Kaduna workers, he never promised that he will demolish the shops of traders, he never promised that he will sell everything that belong to public, he never said he is going to increase school fees when he was campaigning.\n\n\u201cHow can we at this time accept the bitter pills. That is why we are here.\n\n\u201cWe are here because of a law called Labour law in Nigeria. That law says, before you declared redundancy, Labour shall be consulted.\n\n\u201cHe claimed he consulted NULGE (Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees), it is false! We have a letter from NULGE that said there was no consultation\u201d, Wabba said.\n\nAccording to the NLC President, the only consultation the governor made with NULGE was to reduce the minimum wage from N30,000 to N18,000.\n\nHe insisted that the N30,000 minimum wage is a law.\n\n\u201cYou can clearly see the disconnect between him and the people\u2026He was gone ahead to intimidate everybody including workers.\u201d\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "Nigerian Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately devolve more powers to the states with respect to security arrangements culminating in some form of state policing and the general security architecture.\n\nTo achieve this, the twelve PDP governors are demanding the president send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian constitution.\n\nThe governors made their demands known on Monday in a communique issued at the end of a meeting of the PDP Governors Forum in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital.\n\nAmongst their demands, the governors also asked President Buhari to summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises the President and all State Governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to the country\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cThe meeting called on Mr President as the Chief Executive Officer of Nigeria and Commander in Chief of Nigerian Armed Forces to immediately send an Executive Bill to the National Assembly to amend the Nigerian Constitution to devolve more powers to the States with respect to security arrangements culminating in some form of State Policing and the general security architecture,\u201d the communique signed by Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Chairman of the PDP Governors Forum read.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, Mr President should summon an immediate meeting of the Nigerian Police Council, which comprises Mr President and all State Governors and other critical stakeholders to evolve and implement strategies to combat the present threats to our union, especially with respect to policing. The meeting agreed that the Police Force still remains the appropriate institution to secure our democracy and should not be subjected to personal attacks. The welfare, training, equipment, funding of all security agencies should be given priority.\u201d\n\nThe PDP governors also backed the resolutions of the 17 southern governors who had called for restructuring and placed a ban on open grazing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting supports the earlier position taken by the Nigeria Governors Forum, Northern Governors Forum and recently by the Southern Governors Forum to adopt ranching as the most viable solution to the herders/farmers clashes in Nigeria; the restructuring of the Nigerian federation to devolve more powers and functions to the States; and reform of various civil institutions to achieve efficiency and equity for all sections of Nigeria,\u201d the PDP governors said in the communique.\n\n\u201cThe meeting enjoins all Nigerians to work together to achieve peace and harmony with one another, devoid of discrimination based on ethnicity, religion and other cleavages. To this end, the meeting called on the incompetent and rudderless APC Government to take bold and deliberate steps to de-escalate and lower tensions in our country and concentrate on projects and policies that will enhance and promote national unity and cohesion.\n\n\u201cThe meeting re-iterated our earlier call for the National Assembly to expedite action on the passage of the Electoral Act that will ensure a free and fair election, including provisions for electronic accreditation and electronic transmission of votes.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "US telecoms giant AT&T has agreed to combine its WarnerMedia business with Discovery in a deal to create a new streaming giant.\n\nThe tie-up brings one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest studios and Discovery\u2019s channels under the same ownership.\n\nAT&T owns CNN, HBO and Warner Bros, after acquiring many brands in a $108.7bn (\u00a377.1bn) purchase of Time Warner in 2018. The deal also marks the entry of another player into a crowded market.\n\nThe proposed merger would put together movie giant Warner Bros. Entertainment, which owns the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, with Discovery\u2019s home, cooking, nature and science shows.\n\n\u201cThis agreement unites two entertainment leaders with complementary content strengths and positions the new company to be one of the leading global direct-to-consumer streaming platforms,\u201d said AT&T chief executive John Stankey.\n\n\u201cIt will support the fantastic growth and international launch of HBO Max with Discovery\u2019s global footprint and create efficiencies which can be re-invested in producing more great content to give consumers what they want.\u201d\n\nWarnerMedia-owned HBO and HBO Max now have around 64 million subscribers worldwide, with hits such as Game of Thrones and Succession under its belt.\n\nBut it is currently dwarfed by larger rivals Netflix, which has 208 million subscribers, and Disney+, which has more than 100 million.\n\nDiscovery, whose portfolio includes Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, reaches more than 88 million US homes, while its Discovery+ streaming service, which launched in January, has 15m subscribers.\n\nDiscovery\u2019s president and chief executive David Zaslav is set to lead the joint company, according to AT&T.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, AT&T will receive $43bn and its shareholders will own 71% of the new company, while Discovery shareholders will hold 29%.\n\nThe new media company will be able to invest more in original streaming content to compete, the companies said. It will house almost 200,000 hours of programming and bring together more than 100 brands under one global portfolio, including: DC Comics, Cartoon Network, Eurosport, Magnolia, TLC and Animal Planet.\n\nThe deal is expected to close by the middle of next year. It still needs approval from Discovery shareholders. AT&T stockholders don\u2019t need to vote on the transaction.",
