          "title": "Insecurity: Ortom, El-Rufai trade words, accuse each other of failure",
          "text": "The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Saturday, took a swipe at his Kaduna counterpart, Nasir El-Rufai, saying he had no moral justification to challenge another governor.\n\nOrtom was reacting to El-Rufai\u2019s accusation that his Benue counterpart was using the insecurity in his state to attack the Federal Government to cover up his failure.\n\nThe Kaduna governor, during a webinar on Friday, said, \u201cI know him (Ortom) and he is not somebody I take very seriously, frankly. He has other issues of governance that he is using the Federal Government as a punching bag to divert attention from his failures.\n\n\u201cGo and find out how many months\u2019 salaries are being owed teachers and public servants in Benue State then you can understand a lot of what Ortom is doing.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Benue governor, responding in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said, \u201cWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another governor. \u201c\n\nAccording to him, El-Rufai divided the people of Kaduna against one another by allegedly not hiding his hatred for indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cA governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful coexistence. El-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency.\n\n\u201cHe has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launch pad back to reckoning. This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian, including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to limelight.\u201d\n\nOrtom said Nigerians had yet to forget the unprintable things El-Rufai said during former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration, saying, \u201cHe insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country.\n\n\u201cHis statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on the record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them, no matter how long it takes.\n\n\u201cIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on a daily basis? El-Rufai admitted paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Benue governor, since the \u201cconfessional statement,\u201d attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalate and kidnapping has become a \u201ccommon crime\u201d in Kaduna under the governor.\n\nOrtom said Benue people did not take El-Rufai seriously, adding, \u201cA man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention. Nasir El-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nOrtom described his Kaduna counterpart as \u201cone of the real enemies of the country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Samples were collected, sent to the laboratory and all the results turned out to be negative,\u201d Burga informed.\n\nWhile urging people of the state to promptly draw government\u2019s attention to suspected bird flu cases, the commissioner disclosed that the state Ministry of Agriculture had over 130 qualified veterinary doctors spread across the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nAccording to him, the veterinary doctors were always ready to attend to complaints from poultry farmers, marketers and indeed the general public.\n\nHe then urged for concerted efforts by all to curtail the current outbreak of the disease in the state, declaring that, \u201call hands must be on deck to ensure that the present wave is brought to a stop and prevent human infection in Bauchi State which can be a serious catastrophe.\u201d\n\nHe said this became imperative in view of the recent disclosure by the NCDC that seven human cases of bird flu had been recorded in Kano and Plateau States.",

No place will be safe. We are at war with ourselves. No herdsmen in the South East will make any attempt to kill anybody again.\n\n\u201cNobody. Every herdsman coming to the South-East must to the culture of the people. Our people everywhere in South-South, South-West and in the north must conform to the culture of the people.\n\n\u201cSome herdsmen threatened that they would come and do this and do that, I said the last killing is the one that happened in the past. No time again will Ebonyi man or woman be killed. Never again. People have the effrontery to say herdsmen are coming to kill people. Let them try it again. That rubbish must stop.\n\n\u201cThis madness in this country must stop. I see videos of Boko Haram ravaging places in the north unchecked. Where is our air fighting powers? We must not be ashamed to borrow fighter jets from other African countries. No nation will allow this kind of thing to be happening,\u201d he stated.\n\nEarlier in a remark, the Chairman of CAN Ebonyi State chapter, Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali, charged the state\u2019s citizens to give way for peace to reign in the state and shun all forms of violence in the state.\n\nHe warned people who are in the habit of sponsoring youths to go into war, desist or face God\u2019s wrath.",

A book titled \u2018Architecture Confluence \u2013 Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow\u2019 was unveiled at the Julius Berger Hall, UNILAG, venue of the event.\n\nMany speakers at the event described Prof. Igwe, a seasoned scholar in architectural history, as an advocate of deep rooted cultural inputs in design conceptualization. His colleagues recalled his numerous contributions to the growth of his department, faculty as well as the entire university in his four decades of scholarly works.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking during the event, Prof. Igwe said; \u201cIn every sphere of our lives, architecture inclusive, we continue to make the same mistakes all year round. It is a colossal failure for an architect to design a house that the owner finds uninhabitable. It is a failure for leaders to lead a country the people find difficult to live in. We must learn to correct our mistakes using the knowledge of history as a tool. Those who do not study history suffered from a terrible type of amnesia.\n\n\u201cWe must not only take in delight in criticising, but must be ready to remember what we criticised and offer alternative ways of doing the same thing in future. That is the major path to development. Amnesia is a serious state of forgetfulness, and that is responsible for the many failures of Africans. We just don\u2019t remember what we need to change.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Ebonyi, Senator Sam Egwu, who chaired the event, described the book as a big honoured done Prof. Igwe in recognition of his many feats in the academia and architecture.

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin, Abuja\n\nDeep concern is being expressed over the lukewarm attitude and low turnout of governorship aspirants in Anambra State to the purchase of the All Progressives Congress (APC) expression of interest and nomination forms for the November 6 State Governorship Election. Investigation by The Nation on Sunday showed that only three aspirants have so far purchased the N22.5 million forms over three weeks after the commencement of the sale of forms.\n\nIt was gathered at the close of work on Friday that only Senator (Dr.) Emmanuel Andy Uba, Dr. George Nnadubem Moghalu and one aspirant whose name our Correspondent was unable to confirm, have picked their forms in the party National Secretariat in Abuja. Party chieftains and political observers are concerned about the lukewarm attitude of party members in the state towards the purchase of the forms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe concern is coming on the heels of the party\u2019s renewed quest to capture Anambra State in order to increase its presence in the South-East geo-political zone of the country before the general elections of 2023. A party chief from Nnewi, Chief Stanley Nwakonobi in a telephone interview expressed surprise at the poor turnout of aspirants to the purchase of nomination forms despite the consultations, enthusiasm and interest initially shown by no fewer thirteen aspirants for the party\u2019s ticket for Agu-Akwa Government House in Akwa.\n\nA source in the party\u2019s Directorate of Organization saddled with the responsibility of the sale of the forms who spoke to our Correspondent in confidence confirmed the poor turnout of aspirants and the attendant concern the development is generating in the party. \u201cAs at close of work today only three aspirants have sent their agents to purchase expression of interest and nomination forms. This development is causing some concerns among the party chieftains and members within and outside the state.\n\n\u201cThough there is still time for the sale of forms, but the lukewarm attitude of our members in Anambra State is not in tune with the vision of the Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to capture more states in the South-East to the party.\u201d\n\nBut a source in the state has attributed the poor turnout of aspirants to purchase the party\u2019s nomination forms to subtle efforts by an independent group, Anambra APC Patriots to provide a platform for all the aspirants to meet with a view to getting them throw up the best candidate among themselves. A meeting to this effect recently held at Hilton Transcrop Hotel, Abuja, where nine of the aspirants met to present their plans and programmes for the state.\n\nThe organisers of the meeting, which had in attendance, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, members of the party\u2019s national caretaker Committee, party chieftains in the state, said the interactive session was a platform to getting the aspirants to work together for the good of the party. Nine of the aspirants at the interactive session include, Sen. (Dr.) Emmanuel Andy Uba, Dr. George Nnadubem Moghalu, Dr. Chidozie Nwankwo, Engr. Johnbosco Onunkwo and Sir. Azuka Okwuosa.\n\nOthers are Mr. Paul Izuchukwu Orajiaka, Chief Ben Etiaba Jnr, Col. Geoffrey Onyejegbu (rtd) and Comrade Maxwell Okoye.",

He added that Orogun community is not the only place where power substations are being built. \u201cWe are pushing to have as many as possible to be built across the country. The president is determined to provide electricity to as many people, and as many communities as possible.\n\n\u201cConcessions have been made by the federal government to assist the generating and distributing companies to ensure that most homes are privately and individually metered. They are already assisting in providing some of the meters for these communities. People should be able to pay for only the electricity used and it is nothing new. That is how it is all over the world, especially in advanced countries. The only obligation that government has is to make the enabling environment for it to be made available.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut people should not be penalized by being forced to pay for electricity used by other people,\u201d he emphasized. The managing director of NDPHC, Mr. Chiedu Ugbo, stated that the project is aimed at improving the standard of living of the people of Orogun community, adding that it will create jobs for the people.

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nPretty actress, Tayo Sobola popularly known as Sotayo Gaga by fans and colleagues in the movie industry has opened up on reasons she had a secret wedding and why she won\u2019t reveal her husband\u2019s identity.\n\nPictures of you wearing a wedding gown went viral recently, are you truly married?\n\nYes, I am married, but the truth is that it\u2019s not recent; I just decided to post the pictures on social media.\n\nHow come you didn\u2019t reveal your husband\u2019s identity?\n\nIt\u2019s because I wanted to keep my marriage and husband private. I am the star and one who\u2019s popularly known in the movie industry, not my husband. He\u2019s a private person, so there is no point exposing him to the public.\n\nNow that you are married, what should we expect from you?\n\nWell, nothing is changing about me. It\u2019s just that I have decided to spread out a little. I just opened my clothing line, Clean Stitches, but a lot of people still don\u2019t believe I own it; some think I just modeled for the brand. Now, we have opened a new branch in Abuja.\n\nWhy Abuja, is that where marriage has taken you?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not really because of marriage. I have a home here in Lagos; I also have a house in Abuja. And I have always been traversing Lagos and Abuja, and now that it is time to expand my business tentacles, I then thought of Abuja. Aside the fact that we have our clients all over the world, Abuja people patronise us a lot. If you notice my signature, you will realise that I deal with lots of boubou, and iro and buba, which are mostly rocked by classy or funky women. And trust me, Abuja has them plenty. So, I did my research and came to the conclusion that since I have a landed property there, and my shop too, I will have good sales. So, I made up my mind to open another branch in Abuja.\n\nAre you now fully into fashion and no more acting for Sotayo?\n\nNo. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am known in the industry already, so I can always go off and on and remain as if I never left. In life, there\u2019s always time and season\u2026there were times we were after fame, now we are after money.\n\nAre you saying that movies are no longer paying your bills?\n\nNot really, but for now, I want to concentrate on my business. There are some doors that being an actress will open that money might not open. So, both acting and business are paying.\n\nOf recent, one of your colleagues came out to say that she makes millions from acting, that they pay her up to N5 million per role. Could that be true?\n\nAbsolutely yes! Why not? Some (producers) can pay you as much as N10 million to feature in a movie, whereas another producer can pay you as low as N200, 000 for the same role. It all depends on your relationship and how you can sell their movie, and how much they have on ground for the production.\n\nFrom the productions you have done in the past, did you make such money?\n\nSo, you think I will invest in a project that will not profit me? Never! Let me tell you a clear truth, I have never produced a movie without making money in return. I am a businesswoman. How can I put my money down and not make profit from it?\n\nThere was a time you featured popular cross dresser, Bobrisky, in one of your movies, what informed that decision?\n\nIf you know me well, you will know that I don\u2019t discriminate. I have known Bobrisky since he was Idris, and if you watch that movie very well, you will see that I used it to pass a message whereby his \u2018younger sister\u2019 was manhandled because of the way he was trying to attract men to himself, and at end of it all, he gave up on that particular habit.\n\nHow and where did you meet your husband?\n\nOne thing people don\u2019t know is that I have been with my husband for over seven to eight years now.\n\nSo, you have been married that long?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get me wrong. We have only been married for a couple of months.\n\nWhere did both of you meet?\n\nLet me give you that as an assignment to find out. Thank you.\n\nBetween compact disc and Netflix, which one do you think brings more profit to the industry?\n\nBoth have their advantages and disadvantages. For the elite, who hardly watch television and can easily access any movie of their choice on their smart phones, they will go for Netflix, YouTube and the rest. For the typical trader, who hardly uses smartphones, they can\u2019t ever rule out compact disc or DVD as we may call it. If I should reason as a business owner, I will go for DVD, but civilization is timeless\u2026everyday we move with new trends.\n\nWould you say your clothing line has changed your dress sense to wearing boubou, iro and buba and abaya kind of clothes?\n\nI can slay iro and buba to the White House. I am someone who likes my comfort, although my mood most times dictates my dressing. But I will choose boubou and iro and buba over any other outfits anytime.\n\nRecently, the Nigerian music industry witnessed a turnaround when Wizkid and Burna Boy won the Grammys, do you think Nollywood movies too can win Oscar?\n\nWhy not? There\u2019s nothing that can never happen. You know, the way white people think is not the way we reason. Recently, Davido featured in Hollywood film, Coming To America 2, so who knows what the next move could be.\n\nWhat do you have to say about Yoruba movies shot with low budget and English movies with high budget and their production quality?\n\nTruly speaking, that\u2019s not the yardstick to determine a low or high budget movie. I can shoot with millions of naira and still have a very bad quality production, while some shoot with hundreds of thousands and get a very good quality job. And I can spend a month on location and still not come up with something good, while some people will spend few days or weeks and come out with a good job. So, all those things don\u2019t determine a good job at all.\n\nSo, no more movie roles for Tayo; it\u2019s all about Clean Stitches now?\n\nNo, don\u2019t get it twisted; you might see me in politics anytime soon.",

          "title": "2023: Why Nigerians should shun APC, PDP \u2013 Sani, ADP chairman",
          "text": "From Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nNational Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Dr Yagbaji Sani, has said that rotational presidency, otherwise known as zoning, has not provided the needed economic development for the country, rather it has broadened the gap of division and nepotism.\n\nHe, therefore, suggested in this interview that political parties should always throw the contest open so that those with the needed administrative acumen would not be disenfranchised because of where they come from.\n\nThe former presidential candidate also joined the clamour for the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, sequel to his utterances on insurgency in the past.\n\nHe maintained that the spate of killings and kidnapping perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents is a by-products of Pantami\u2019s teachings.\n\nHe, however, backed the Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Mahmud Gumi, for facilitating negotiations with bandits and parents of kidnapped children, adding that he has not done anything wrong.\n\nHe also encouraged political leaders to judiciously utilise resources in their possession to create employment, build schools, hospitals and roads, in order to keep the youth busy. Except:\n\nWhat is your take on the spate of insecurity in the country?\n\nIf truth must be told, I believe it is the consequences of leadership failure. Because when there is leadership failure, definitely, you will see that even the most basic things that should be taken care of will not be addressed properly. Because when you look at democracy or any form of government at all, in fact, even in constitution, the two fundamental responsibilities of the government is the issue of security and the welfare of the people. That is what the constitution says. Any government that cannot provide the two things for its citizens has no moral rights to expect respect from the citizens. And if care is not taken it might even get to a revolt; the people may rebel against you because you have not been able to take care of the basic requirements. So, I believe that why what is happening is happening is because we have leadership failure. Period.\n\nWhile the PDP is pushing for a summit to discuss the way forward on insecurity, the APC is not seeing the need for such a meeting. How do we address the problem?\n\nBoth the APC and PDP are one and the same. It is six and half a dozen. That is what it is. You see, when you look at APC and you throw back your attention and recollect what happened during the PDP era, it is just a re-enactment of what happened during the PDP era only that this time around it is more endemic. There seems to be a total collapse of the situation today. We are just afraid that the whole thing will collapse under the PDP. But PDP was not better than what we are seeing under APC. Under PDP, Boko Haram insurgents were even coming to Abuja attacking people, and exploding everywhere. People were afraid just like what we have now. People were not free to move around. But the case we have today is worse; which means that the situation has been degrading from the PDP time till now. So, it is like a case of a kettle calling the pot black. There is nothing that the PDP is accusing the APC today that it did not do. There was leadership failure under the PDP too. And what we are running away is for Nigeria to run away from the situation we have found ourselves today. So, the issue is that Nigerians must start to think and look away from these two parties. Nigeria is bigger than PDP and APC because we transcend those parties. Nigeria does not start and end with APC and PDP. And, when you look at it, the same people that were in PDP in which we were having the problem are the same people today that are in APC. So, it is not as if outside these people you do not have Nigerians that can take care of this country. The situation we have in this country is that Nigerians do not want to rise to the occasion themselves. We must begin to see the futility of continuing to support these two parties in government because they do not have what Nigeria needs. And what Nigeria needs today are people who have this country at heart and have the competence and capability to deliver this 21st Century economy that we have which is a promise of greatness. There is nothing that we need in this economy to make it great that is not there. What is lacking is leadership. What is lacking is the fact that our process of the recruitment of leadership is still at that stage of people manipulating the levers of power and rigging elections to bring in people that cannot deliver. So, if you have your process of recruitment of leadership as corrupt as it is, there is no way you can dream of having people that would live up to expectations or be ready to give this country the kind of leadership that it deserves. So, this is why we are just in a vicious cycle. And both the APC and PDP, believing in me, everybody in this country knows that they are one and the same. It is the same bad dream that we had during the last administration that we are having today. Nigerians never thought that we will be where we are in this country today. Why because we have competent people. We have the resources. We have the statute as a nation which is respected across the globe. That is why anywhere you go Nigerians are respected because they know what you are worth; in terms of resources, leadership and capacity. So, when you talk about PDP or APC, believing in me, it is those that what you can call failure of our circumstances. We just found ourselves in almost a failed state. Look at what happened during Jonathan, the international community had come to rescue Nigeria. It is because Nigeria was almost failing as a nation. Today, we are in a worse situation that we need to be rescued that is why some people are saying that we should look for foreign assistance. It is because Nigeria was almost failing. The political class you have today that are in charge of the affairs of this country have failed. The truth is that they do not have what Nigeria needs so they cannot give that leadership. That is why people should look at the direction of ADP. God knows why he put parties like ours in this country today. It is to rescue this country. There is nothing we will do today that will give this country the kind of progress, peace and unity that are required under another APC or PDP government. It will never happen. Because when they come in instead of concentrating on building the nation they will just be talking about things that are not relevant. The issue is that we have come to the stage where another set of people should be allowed to run the affairs of this country. We can do it. It has been proven that things cannot change unless we the followership change. And change is an option. If it is a situation where we do not have an option that would be a different thing entirely. So, the blame game is all because we do not want to change. So, the press has a lot to do here. The press can make this country work by ensuring that it changes the narrative. It should not be about PDP and APC. Nigerians should begin to understand that there is an option or alternative that is more credible that can give this country a leadership that would provide new path to progress, prosperity, unity and pragmatic leadership that will unleash this huge potential that we have as a country. Everybody knows that we are a country that is of promise of greatness by everything that we need to have. Look at the leadership we have today that is not even engaged with the people. As bad as the situation is you should have a kind of interaction with your people. But that is not happening. Money is given out and nobody is accounting for it even for the insecurity you are talking about. Billions of naira have been given to this people, nobody is telling us what happened to those monies, how it was spent. If it was their own money, none of them would allow things like this to happen; that you spent billions and there is nothing to show for it. There is evidence of arms purchased, no money in the account and to the extent that they are even asking for more money. They want to be given more budget to fight this war as if we are people that have saw-dust in our brains. We need to break from this rigmarole and the narrative of PDP and APC. We still have two years to go. It can be done. The press can lead. Every country where meaningful change happened, it is the press that leads the way.\n\nDo you also subscribe to the sacking of the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, following his utterances on insurgency?\n\nI have told you about leadership failure. Where you have leadership, government will not wait for this thing to happen whether wrong of right. The man is not denying what he said or didn\u2019t say. He did. So, the issue is that government, particularly the president, should realise the fact that he was elected by the people of this country and he swore by the Quran that he was going to protect the interest of this country; that he was going to exert fear or favour. So, when you have discovered that in one reason or the other you have a minister in your cabinet that has been accused of most of the things that are happening today in terms of insecurity, whether remotely or anyhow you want to look it, at least, to demonstrate to the nation that he is representing them and that he is living up to his responsibility, this man should be eased out because he did not deny it. Why are we having the problem we are having today? It is because of people that had, or still have those kind of mentality, and their ideology is not in tune with the modern way of doing things. He said he did, but he is recanting that he is not in that kind of belief anymore. But, we are suffering from the by-products. That is what snowballed into what we are having today. It is those people that you taught, those radical thinking that are still in the bush. Even though you have now said that you have renowned that ideology, we are still suffering from the damage in this country. Because that is why we still have the likes of Boko Haram people that are thinking differently. Yes, he has apologised. If the country wants, it can forgive him or allow the law to take its course. But, the right thing to be done is for the government to relief him of his duties and responsibilities, and then let him understand that what he did, the country is still suffering from it. In other climes, if you are in government of a high school, and they discovered that you raped a girl or smoked marijuana, you would be in trouble. There was a judge of a Supreme Court that was supposed to be appointed in America, you can see the extent they went because a woman came out and said the man took advantage of her in a high school. It became an issue. So, it is not enough to come out and apologise. He should not be allowed to continue in office in all fairness given the circumstances we are in today, and given the fact that we cannot divorce those radical ideologies we are having today. So, he is responsible.\n\nAre you comfortable with the role being played by Sheikh Gumi in negotiating with bandits?\n\nUnder this circumstance or the situation we are in, it is the right thing to do. Do you know why? The government has denied people money they are supposed to use to build hospitals, schools and roads. They come to Abuja, collect the money, sit down in a room and divide the money among themselves, thinking that the people are stupid or they do not know what is happening. If they are using the billions collected from the federation account to build schools, hospitals and good roads you would not have bandits. If some have jobs and leave their houses at 8:00a.m to go to work, would they have time to go into the bush? That is why they are taking it by force. So, under this scenario, it is right. Let them sit up. Let them stop stealing. Let them use the money to create employment and not to buy houses in Dubai or Europe and always going for vacation. They have exhausted all the civil ways of doing things, that is why they are in the bush. Gumi is right. When Buhari came to power he said 70 per cent of the budget is being stolen. But what did he do about it? And you want the people to just fold their hands and be watching you?\n\nThough we still have two years to the next general election, there has been this agitation for the Southeast to produce the next president. What is your take?\n\nI do not like to indulge in what I call a very high intelligent way of looking at issues in the country. The problem we have in this country transcends zoning. They are more serious than where the president of Nigeria should come from. Why are we where we are today? It is because of the issue of zoning. You can take it from the Jonathan\u2019s time to now. It is just because they did not allow the best material to emerge as the president of this country; it was always handpicked. It has always taken religious dimension as if when it comes to the issues of the country the person can do better. We should wake up and begin to think about this country as a serious business. If in your private business you start bringing in sentiments like employing your brothers even when they are not competent, what would happen to the business? Definitely, it will fail. For God sake, let us be serious. The position of the president requires more than what we are attributing to it. I look at it as lazy and people who are not serious in their way of thinking. In social club you can do that, but when it comes to the issue of president, we should have a checklist as a nation. We should look at track records and performances that will matter. This is doable. The leaders of thoughts are there to do it. The press is there. It can set the agenda and change the narrative. Look at where we are today. We are a laughing stock simply because there is a leadership failure and because we did not do the right thing. If zoning is working, why are people in Katsina being killed like chicken? Why is the whole North on fire? The business of running the country is a very serious business. It is not about this man is a Yoruba man, or Hausa man or an Igbo man. Let us begin to look at tract records. If you look at countries that have gone passed us like Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, most of them jettisoned the idea of where a person is coming from. Because when you do that you have completely disjointed the whole issue of running the country from what it should be to what has no relevance in the governance itself. And that is why we are always failing.\n\nWhat is the prospect of ADP in the next general election?\n\nIt is very bright. Do not mind the ballooning of membership they are telling people. Believe me, by the time the two parties will explode you will see what will happen. We believe that the ADP has a very unique opportunity in 2023 because Nigerians will wake up. And sane people who have the country at heart will look for a party like ADP to begin to build Nigeria and not themselves or tribes because that is what we represent. We are the Noah\u2019s Ark that will take the country to the Promised Land.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nDetermined in stopping bandits from infiltrating Abuja, security forces have commenced massive deployment of personnel and equipment to all entry and exit points of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThis is coming barely 24 hours after Daily Sun exclusively reported that the military high command had approved a massive deployment of special forces to fringe towns and villages where bandits are believed to be taking refuge.\n\nSunday Sun investigation revealed that security operatives have also commenced raid on major spots in Kogi, Niger and Nasarawa states just as they have commenced demolition and raids on all known criminal hideouts within and around the FCT.\n\nThe security agencies made up of a joint task force are also said to be raiding major motor parks, uncompleted buildings, markets, mechanic workshops and villages, where criminals and bandits are believed to be hiding.\n\nIt was gathered that following the alarm raised by residents of Bwari, a satellite town in the FCT, the military in conjunction with security agencies swung into action.\n\nThe military, Sunday Sun gathered, is on red alert to counter any terrorists invasion. The Forward Operation Bases (FOB) is also combing the forests within Keffi, Niger and Kogi states, where some of the terrorists were said to have set up their camps. The camps have been demolished.\n\nA security source who does not want to be mentioned told Sunday Sun that the security agencies are also clamping down on illegal drug sellers, especially the hawkers, as it has been discovered that they have direct contacts with the criminals.\n\nThe source identified Maraba, Masaka, Nyanya Motor park, Kugbo, Kubwa, Dutse, Apo, Gwagwalada, Gwagwa, Mpape, Asokoro village, Garki village, Jabi motor park, Utako market, Nyanya market, Zuba, Suleja, Abuja/Keffi road, Lugbe, Kuje, Orozo, Kado, among others as some of the identified spots in Abuja.\n\nThe Guards Brigade, which is saddled with the primary assignment of providing security for the president, his immediate family, VIPs, the FCT and the surrounding states, has deployed enough manpower and equipment to give any criminal group that may want to cause trouble heat, it was gathered.\n\nThe Army Headquarters Garrison is also said to have deployed its men, especially in plain clothes, to some of these places to checkmate activities of criminals.\n\nThe source told Sunday Sun that the military cannot afford to allow criminals, especially bandits and terrorists, into the FCT.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI can tell you that we are on red alert. We know there is tension over terrorists\u2019 invasion of the FCT after the Niger State governor raised the alarm that the terrorists would soon come here. We know they would come and we are ready for them. Already, our men are all over the place to battle these men. Abuja is the last place we will allow them to come and carry out their atrocities.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that prior to the alarm raised by the Niger State governor, over possible invasion of the FCT, bandits had taken over some FCT villages, kidnapping innocent villagers, including traditional rulers, security operatives on a regular basis and collecting ransom from their relatives.\n\nRecently, bandits invaded an orphanage home and abducted over eight orphans. The police said they were carrying out a covert operation to rescue the victims.\n\nMeanwhile, following social media reports that kidnappers had infiltrated the nation\u2019s capital, the FCT Police Commissioner, Bala Ciroma, in a statement assured that the FCT was not under attack by terrorists, urging the residents not to panic, as the police have put all security measures in place to protect lives and property.\n\nBut despite the assurances, activities of criminals have continued to thrive in the FCT.\n\nCiroma in a statement signed by the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, said: \u201cThe attention of the FCT Joint Security Team has been drawn to a viral publication in the social media purporting that the \u2018Federal Capital Territory is under the attack of Boko Haram terrorists\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Security Team of the FCT wishes to refute the mischievous publication targeted at creating palpable tension amongst the well-spirited residents of the FCT. Contrary to the speculation, the Heads of Security Agencies (HOSA) in the Federal Capital Territory in the bid to address security concerns within the FCT, held a strategic meeting on Thursday 29th April, 2021, where the team resolved to deploy alternative proactive crime-fighting measures within the FCT particularly in areas with challenging terrain including aggressive motorized/foot patrols.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, more schools have shutdown in Abuja, following threats by bandits to attack and abduct students. The mass closure of schools kicked off on Wednesday. On Thursday and Friday, more schools sent their students home.\n\nGovernment schools are not left out, despite repeated assurances by the FCT administration that the schools were safe. The worst hit areas are Bwari, Kuje, Kwali and Abaji.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe Caretaker Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, has called for the postponement of the local government election in the state slated for Saturday, May 22, 2021.\n\nHe made the call at a press conference organised by the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) in Ibadan, yesterday.\n\nOke explained that the postponement was to allow the APC participate in the election, adding that the party decided not to be part of the election process initially based on the Supreme Court judgment that the party expected on the sack of all council chairmen by the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court delivered its verdict on Friday and faulted the sack of the chairmen. The apex court then held that the tenure of the sacked council chairmen, elected in 2018 had expired, and ordered the state government to pay all salaries and allowances of the sacked chairmen from May 2019 to March 2022, apart from awarding a cost of N20million against the government as damages.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe could not be part of the preparation for that election at the initial stage because we felt the dissolution of democratically-elected chairmen and councillors was illegal. Now that we have been vindicated, it is thus right for the government to give a level playing field in order for us to test our popularity.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, the former ALGON chairman, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye, who was a former chairman of Oluyole local government, expressed appreciation to all those who contributed to the victory at the apex court. He dedicated the victory to the memory of immediate past two-term governor of the state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, who was instrumental to the victory based on the support he gave.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt, Joe Effiong, Uyo\n\nIt was a bloody Saturday, yesterday, as gunmen overran various police formations in Rivers and Akwa Ibom states, killing a total of 12 policemen and a woman.\n\nThis is further to the orgy of deadly attacks on security operatives that has continued to rip through the South East and South South regions in the recent weeks.\n\nIn Rivers State, gunmen reportedly shot dead at least seven policemen in an unexpected invasion of communities in the State. Similarly, gunmen reportedly overran another police station in Akwa Ibom, gunning down five policemen, and a woman.\n\nThe Rivers incident happened late last Friday night on the East-West Road between Choba Bridge and Rumuji community. Sunday Sun gathered that the gunmen first attacked the C4i police formation at Emohua community and killed two people. They also attacked a stop-and-search police point at Ogbakiri Junction before moving to Rumuji where they killed three policemen.\n\nIt was further learnt that the hoodlums also attacked Elimgbu Police station in Obio/Akpor LGA and killed two men in what seemed like a coordinated operation.\n\nThe youth president of Elimgbu community, Uche Morgan, told newsmen that the incident took place about 10pm on Friday night.\n\nMorgan disclosed that the moment he heard it, he mobilised his fellow youths to the station ad were there till Saturday morning. He revealed that the shooting caused serious panic in the community, adding that the youths would synergise with the security agencies.\n\nState Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police (SP), confirmed the development to journalists.\n\nHe said in a statement that were killed.\n\n\u201cIn the course of exchange of fire, two of the attackers were fatally wounded and died on the spot.\u201d\n\nThe PPRO disclosed that the third attack at Elimgbu Police Station was equally resisted by the police, though three officers were killed, but the exchange of fire forced them to abandon their bullet-riddled Hilux van; they later escaped in a snatched Sienna bus.\n\nHe said their encounter with the police also forced them (gunmen) to abandon the Sienna car at the Refinery junction.\n\nOmoni added that the bodies of the \u201cfallen heroes\u201d had been evacuated and deposited in the mortuary.\n\nHe said the Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday, who led members of his team and tactical commanders to the respective scenes yesterday morning, for on-the-spot assessment had launched a serious manhunt for the perpetrators.\n\nThe police spokesman said the police boss later had a security meeting with his team, assuring that security had been further beefed up in all the police formations in the state.\n\nHe added that \u201cit is pertinent to note, that in all three attacks carried out last night, no police station/formation was burnt. Regrettably, a total of five assault rifles were lost in the incident.\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom attack which came barely one week after two police officers were gunned down in Ika local government area of Akwa Ibom State, saw the killing another five policemen and a woman in Ini Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe policemen and the woman said to be a wife of one of the police officers were allegedly gunned down by hoodlums at a police divisional headquarter situated at Odoro Ikpe.\n\nSunday Sun learned that the hoodlums were said to have stormed the police station in two buses in the early hours of Saturday. They also set some vehicles and the police station ablaze, injuring some other policemen who scampered for safety.\n\nConfirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Odiko MacDon (SP), who was at the scene of the attack for on-the-spot assessment, said: \u201cThere was an attack at the Divisional Police headquarters, Odoro Ikpe in Ini Local Government Area. Six persons including five officers and a wife of an officer were killed.\u201d\n\nRecall that police stations and other security posts in Akwa Ibom State have in recent months experienced cases of early-morning attack, leading to the death of officers and destruction of facilities, including utility vehicles and infrastructures.\n\nAn online statement purportedly issues by the office of the chairman, Ini Local Government Area, Mr Isreal Idaisin, alleged that the invasion was carried out by members of Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe gunmen who came in two buses and a Sienna car filled with armed men numbering more than 40, arrived Ini Local Government Area with sophisticated weapons and broke into the police facility at precisely 2:45am, killing five policemen on duty, burning vehicles while inflicting injuries on others.\n\n\u201cSome police officers who attempted to repel the gunmen were overrun.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the council boss commended the youths of the area for raising the alarm which helped to reduce the number of casualties.\n\n\u201cI urge the good people of Ini LGA to stay calm as we are working with relevant security agencies and the Government of Akwa Ibom State to ensure that the situation is contained and necessary modalities are being put in place to forestall a recurrence. There is no cause for fear as the culprits will be brought to book in no distant time,\u201d the statement read\n\nSunday Sun could not however confirm the authenticity of the statement as it was signed neither by the chairman nor any of his media aides. He equally did not take his calls.",

          "text": "\u2022Eyes N30 billion in second quarter\n\nObinna Chima\n\nDespite the decline in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) last year due mainly to the effects of COVID-19, Ogun State Government raked in N21 billion in the first quarter of this year. Governor Dapo Abiodun disclosed this in a statement on Friday, saying the state has perfected plans to generate over N100 billion in 2021.\n\nAbiodun spoke at a special Iftar (breaking of fast) with members of the House of Representatives, House of Assembly, State Executive Council, and the Body of Permanent Secretaries. He stressed that his administration was committed to putting the state on a strong financial and economic footing through creative governance.\n\nThe governor said the dip in the state\u2019s IGR in 2020 was due to drop in earnings from the Pay As You Earn (PAYE), tax incentives given to industries in the state, and lack of revenue from the education sector.\n\nHe said the target for the second quarter of 2021 was N30 billion.\n\nAbiodun stated, \u201cOur IGR dipped in 2020 and there are some reasons for that \u2013 there was no Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for us during the COVID-19 period, we gave incentives to industries because they couldn\u2019t work during that period, and because we are the education capital of the country, a lot of our IGR was coming from the tertiary institutions and because there were no students in schools, the revenue did not come in.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what the good news is, the good news is that first quarter of 2021, we already got N21 billion.\n\n\u201cLast year, we did N58 billion, so we\u2019ve already gotten half of what we got last year in one quarter. This present quarter, we will do at least N30 billion, and by the end of this year, by the grace of God, we will do over N100 billion in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration discovered that Land Use Charge was not being paid in the state, stressing that it inherited a database of 14,000 people from the previous administration. He said the discovery led his administration to put in place mechanisms, which had helped the state to realise a database of Land Use Charge for over 1.5 million people. \u201cThis will translate into a lot for our administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nAbiodun stated that his administration would soon launch Ogun State Land Administration and Management System (OLAS) to help residents of the state who had built on government property to come and regularise their papers.\n\n\u201cThat system using ICT, we are going to ensure that all those that have built, we are starting with government owned property alone, all those that have built on government property will have to come and regularise their papers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe are not talking about those that built on any other land, we are talking of government land alone, so we bring them in to regularise their papers.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the state of the nation and the intended reversal of the new minimum wage by some states, the governor said his administration, being one of the first to sign the minimum wage into law, was committed to the continuous payment of the new wage to its workforce.\n\nHe stated, \u201cNot only did we implement it, my colleagues are now reversing the minimum wage because they can\u2019t pay it. Some of my colleagues have even asked me if I am sure I can keep on paying the minimum wage, I told them that Ogun State is not like other states, that in Ogun State, we have to keep on paying the wage.\n\n\u201cSo, I am committing to the very excellent public service that I have that I will continue to pay the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nAbiodun urged members of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), to democratically put their best candidates forward at the forthcoming local government elections in the state. He assured that everything would be done in consonance with the principles of democracy.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the deputy governor, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, commended the governor for his quality leadership, saying this is behind the giant strides of his administration in the last two years.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe share of United States dollar reserves held by central banks across the world fell to 59 per cent\u2014its lowest level in 25 years, during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThis is according to the just-released International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) survey.\n\nSome analysts claimed this partly reflected the declining role of the US dollar in the global economy, in the face of competition from other currencies used by central banks for international transactions.\n\nIf the shifts in central bank reserves were large enough, they could affect currency and bond markets.\n\nThe dollar acts as the primary reserve currency for the global economy, and foreign exchange reserves in central banks around the world account for the bulk of the US dollar.\n\nAccording to the survey, the share of US dollar assets in central bank reserves dropped by 12 percentage points\u2014from 71 to 59 per cent\u2014since the euro was launched in 1999, although with notable fluctuations in-between.\n\nIt noted that the share of the euro has fluctuated around 20 per cent, while the share of other currencies including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and Chinese renminbi climbed to 9 per cent in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe value of the US dollar has been broadly unchanged, while the US dollar\u2019s share of global reserves has declined, indicating that central banks have indeed been shifting gradually away from the US dollar.\n\nSome expected that the US dollar share of global reserves would continue to fall as emerging market and developing economy central banks sought further diversification of the currency composition of their reserves.\n\nA few countries, such as Russia, have already announced their intention to do so.\n\nBut despite major structural shifts in the international monetary system over the past six decades, the US dollar has remained the dominant international reserve currency. Any changes to the US dollar\u2019s status are likely to emerge in the long run, the survey noted.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had on April 27, 2018, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria signed a Currency Swap Agreement with the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) on behalf of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe swap deal, an agreement with a three-year tenor, allows both the CBN and PBoC to swap a maximum amount of 15 billion Renminbi/Chinese Yuan (CNY 15 billion) for N720 billion.\n\nThis amount is equivalent to $2.5 billion using the prevailing exchange rate of N305:$1 at the time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Centres to have between 750 and 1000 voters\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere are indications that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may approve up to 176,996 polling centres across the 36 states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as part of the ongoing expansion and verification of polling centres ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nBut the adjustments of the lower and upper thresholds for voting points, according to INEC, would be from 750 and 1000, to 500 and 750.\n\nThe implication is that INEC would be creating additional 57,023 polling units nationwide, although the breakdown is not known yet.\n\nA memo dated April 20, 2021 was said to have backed the development. The document with reference number INEC/DE/No:72/2021 and titled: \u201cDecision Extraction on the Amendment of the Threshold for the Conversion of Voting Points to Polling Units,\u201d reads in part: \u201cThe Commission at its meeting held on Tuesday, April 20, 2021, deliberated on the above subject and approved as follows: The adjustment of the lower and upper thresholds for Voting Points from 750 and 1000 to 500 and 750, respectively\n\n\u201cThat the ICT and Electoral Operations Departments and the state and local government area offices of the Commission should adopt these new thresholds in implementing the ongoing programme of expanding voting access to Polling Units.\n\n\u201cYou may wish to refer the extract to all Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) and Directors for information and necessary action, please.\u201d\n\nMaryam Iya Musa, a director at the Commission, signed the memo.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye, had earlier told THISDAY that the commission planned to create new polling units from the existing 119,973 polling centres. Okoye said INEC would create additional 57,023 polling units, to make the proposed 176,996 polling centres\n\nThis is coming 25 years after the defunct National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) created the existing polling units, which INEC has been using.\n\nUnder the new polling centres, units would have between 500 and 750 voters.\n\nPutting all elements into consideration, INEC, THISDAY gathered, had settled for the application of 500 lower limit and 750 upper limit.\n\nUnder the former INEC leadership, headed by Professor Attahiru Jega, the commission planned the creation of 30,000 polling units. In the new polling centres before it was rejected, northern states had over 21,000 while the entire South got a little above 8,000.\n\nVoting point platform, as widely known and accepted by stakeholders, was based on lower and upper thresholds of 750 and 1,000 registered voters, respectively.\n\nBut, as at press time, the commission was yet to give a breakdown of state-by-state or zone-by-zone of the polling centres.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Ubandoma Joshua Laven, has been decorated as state patron of Vigilante Group of Nigeria VGN, with the mandate to get rid of criminal elements in the state.\n\nBut the Archbishop of the African Church, Lagos Province, Most Reverend Julius Oludotun, has called on the federal and state governments to make efforts to tackle the seemingly intractable security problem.\n\nHowever, on the Benue killings, the MINDA group has also raised the alarm over what it described as threat to exterminate Benue by suspected Fulani herdsmen.\n\nThe group, while briefing reporters at the BIPC center, Makurdi, disclosed that the over 200 people killed were scatted across such councils as Logo, Kwande, Guma, Makurdi, Gwer West, Apa, Agatu, Ado and Okpowku local government areas of the state with wanton destruction of farm crops, produce and property worth billions of naira.\n\nIn a statement read by a former Permanent Secretary, Government House, Dr. Tivlumun Nyitse, the group called on the federal government to live up to its full constitutional responsibility and provide security for the lives and property of the people of the state.\n\nThe group also condemned the recent unprovoked armed attack on Governor Samuel Ortom and the one on Abagana IDP Camp by suspected herdsmen in which seven people lost their lives and many others injured.\n\nWhile calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to rise and turn the tide against insecurity in the country, he urged him to arrest the drift to a failed state, eschew provincialism and be the president of all Nigerians so as to preserve, protect and enhance the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, we stand with the Governor of Benue State to demand that President Muhammadu Buhari should rise up to his duties as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to protect all Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion or sex because this is the primary responsibility of government as enshrined in the constitution for which he also swore on oath to do,\u201d the statement emphasised.\n\nHowever, from Jos, Laven, who spoke shortly after his decoration at the council\u2019s secreteriat in Langtang North at the weekend, said peace, security and the well being of Nigerians remainedparamount and a panacea for economic and political development of the country.\n\nThe chairman also called for adequate support to all other volunteer security outfits to rid the society of criminal elements.\n\nHe argued that vigilante groups should be permitted by the federal government to carry small arms so that they could effectively police their environment, adding: \u201cWe can not go after kidnappers and bandits with bare hands as doing so will endanger our lives in the line of duties.\u201d\n\nHe said there was an urgent need for government at the three tiers to support the vigilante group of Nigeria by training and empowering them to support the fight against crimes such as armed robbery, banditry, kidnapping and all forms of anti-social behaviours in the society.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer news that the capacity of the Nigerian Police today cannot curtail the rising trend of criminal violence in the society, hence the need for community policing like the VGN.\n\n\u201cI make bold to say that the vigilante group are closer to the communities and if properly engaged, they can contribute in addressing the overwhelming security challenges bedevilling the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Council boss further said experience has shown in recent times how vigilante groups mostly comprising of volunteers, operating under the mandate of community consensus to fight crime have recorded huge success.\n\nHe therefore advised Nigerians to communally police their environment to complement the efforts of other security agencies in the fight against the menace of banditry and kidnapping that have now become a lucrative business in the country.\n\nAdministrative commander of vigilante group of Nigeria, Plateau State command, Abubakar Sadiq said the chairman was chosen from among many others to be their Patron, because of his contribution to the growth and development of his immediate community .\n\nAccording to him, to whom much is given, much is expected and as such expressed confident that the chairman, now their patron, would do better than he has been doing in the past.\n\nOn his part, Oludotun made the appeal at a press conference held yesterday at the African Church Saviour\u2019s Cathedral, Agege Diocese to commemorate the 3rd Biennial Congress and the 5th year founder\u2019s day anniversary of the Lagos Province with the theme: \u201cHe is able\u201d.\n\nThe cleric raised fears about the worsening trend of abductions and kidnappings that is clearly overwhelming the security apparatus of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe government should tighten the security apparatus of the nation and we the citizens should obey simple instructions. We appeal to the federal and state governments that they should accord security the importance it deserves, because all of us know we are not safe, especially, the Church.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t deceive you, they are after the church but we know as Christians we are normal, we don\u2019t fight if there is any problems, we pray to God. The states have a group called Amotekun. In some states now they have already defeated the bandits, so, the federal government should do more on security, especially, because they are after the Church now.\n\n\u201cWe as Christians need to turn back to God. We are equally guilty of some of the sins committed. Our God is able just as earlier stated to deliver us from every challenge and unpalatable situation we may be going through now. We know with God all things are possible, Nigeria needs prayer at crucial time, by the grace of God peace will come back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kinsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nLast Tuesday, the Professor Bolaji Owasanoye-led Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) organised a high profile policy dialogue and zoom conference titled, \u201cCorruption and Cost of Governance in Nigeria.\u201d The conference revealed that government at a critical time like this in the country\u2019s history still retained 943 Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) and 541 state-owned corporations.\n\nThe policy dialogue was attended by Senate President Ahmed Lawan; Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed; and Head of Service of the Federation, Mrs Yemi Esan; among several academics.\n\nDirector-General, Budget Office of the Federation, Mr Ben. Akabueze, declared at the meeting that 943 MDAs and 541 corporations owned by the federal government had become a drag on the economy. Akabueze said the present size of the federal bureaucracy was unsustainable. He identified bloated civil service, high number of political office holders, cabinet size, corrupt budget practices, election cost, and multiplication of MDAs as drivers of high cost of governance.\n\nHe noted that there was a growing concern over huge government spending on recurrent expenditure at the expense of capital projects.\n\nAkabueze said, \u201cThere have been persistent calls for reduction of governance cost in Nigeria in view of the impact on government\u2019s fiscal situation. The current system is clearly unsustainable.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that recurrent spending accounted for more than 75 per cent of actual MDA expenditure between 2011 and 2020, personnel costs accounted for 40 per cent of actual recurrent spending in 2020, while overhead was just three per cent. Actual MDA recurrent spending rose sharply from N3.61 trillion in 2015 to N5.26 trillion in 2018 and N7.91 trillion in 2020, he said.\n\nAkubueze said beyond Nigeria\u2019s 27 ministers, 16 ministers of state, and 27 ministries, there were 561 federal government-owned corporations whose duplicated functions had significantly shot up the cost of governance. He said the multiplicity of ministries and extra-ministerial bodies had become a huge drain on the economy.\n\nOn the bloated federal civil service, Akabueze stated, \u201cThe current structure and size of the federal bureaucracy is clearly unsustainable for the size of the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said \u201ccurrent efforts aimed at eliminating \u2018ghost\u2019 non-existent staff on FGN payroll are yielding some result; however hardly any sanctions against the perpetrators.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the huge number of political office holders and their retinue of aides, saying they are driving up the cost of governance.\n\nAt issue at the conference was the high cost of governance in Nigeria, which was weighing heavily on the economy.\n\nIn her submission, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, said the federal government had initiated a raft of measures to cut the cost of governance in the face of dwindling revenue occasioned by the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant global economic tailspin. Ahmed said the measures were targeted at reducing recurrent expenditure, which was projected to gulp about 41.5 per cent of the total provisions of N13.588 trillion in the 2021 budget, amounting to N5.64 trillion.\n\nShe stated that the proposed cost-saving measures were aimed at streamlining government expenditure with revenue.\n\n\u201cWe still see government expenditure increase to a terrain twice higher than our revenue,\u201d she said, and urged all government agencies to come together to trim the cost.\n\nThe minister said the national budgets were filled every year with projects that were not only recycled but also unnecessary.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed that the salaries committee that I chair, work together with the Head of Service and other members of the committee to review the government payrolls in terms of stepping down on cost,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the federal government would review the number of government agencies in terms of their mandates, adding that the government would consider merging agencies with similar mandates.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, \u201cWe need to work together, all agencies of the government, to cut down our cost. We need to cut down unnecessary expenditures, expenditures that we can do without.\n\n\u201cOur budgets are filled year-in-year-out with projects that we see over and over again and also projects that are not necessary.\u201d\n\nReducing Cost of Governance\n\nAkabueze maintained that it was imperative to minimise corruption and reduce governance cost in Nigeria to engender development. He recommended critical steps to be taken to include prioritising the completion of on-going projects to enable the country reap the benefits of such projects and save variation costs; allowing only properly conceptualised, designed, costed, and appraised projects; exclusion of projects that relate to matters that are the responsibilities of state and local governments; and exclusion of recurrent expenditure items from the capital budget.\n\nHe also advocated the amendment of the constitution to restructure the federation to six regions, instead of the current 36 states.\n\nIn addition, he said the constitutional provision on appointment of ministers should be amended to reduce the number of cabinet ministers.\n\n\u201cThe president is obliged to appoint not more than 24 to be appointed from the six geopolitical zones, reduce the number of federal ministries from 27 to not more than 20,\u201dAkabueze said.\n\nHe said the United States with 54 states and Washington D.C. had 15 departments/ministries.\n\nOn the federal bureaucracy, Akabueze stated, \u201cTo build a more efficient civil service, we must stop treating the civil service as some other form of political, ethnic, and religious patronage.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive staff audit and job evaluation is imperative to determine the right size for the federal civil service without any adverse effect on efficiency in the service. To avoid disruptions in the civil service, the staff rationalisation process should be gradual and handled fairly. Staff salaries need to be consolidated and harmonised across MDAs while allowances should be role-based.\u201d\n\nIn a paper titled, \u201cReducing the Cost of Governance in Nigeria,\u201d Akabueze stated, \u201cThis will reduce disparity, boost staff morale and reduce the motivation for corrupt practices. In addition, it is important to amend sections in the act establishing some agencies, which allows their boards to periodically review staff salaries without considering government\u2019s fiscal position.\n\n\u201cAlso, the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission needs to consider government fiscal position in approving salary structures. To control abuse associated with non-regular allowances paid through GIFMIS to house officers and interns in the health sector, limit the number of such staff, their exit period and introduce mechanism for monitoring the implementation.\u201d\n\nHe argued, \u201cPayment of allowances should be role-based. Hence, for example, medical doctors in allied institutions and research institutes should not be paid shift allowance unless they are practising.\u201d\n\nThe director-general of budget maintained that regarding recruitment abuses, the Budget Office and the Office of the Accountant General needed to work more collaboratively to prevent abuses in personnel cost.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need to adopt a cost effective electoral system and limit the number and aides of political office holders.\n\nConduct of Elections\n\nAkabueze identified elections as a major driver of high cost of governance. He said the conduct of periodic elections and the resultant litigations in tribunals and courts contributed to the high cost of governance in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAlthough the conduct of open, free, fair and competitive election is important in democratic governance, its management should not be so costly to the government.\n\n\u201cThe budget for the 2019 general elections exceeded N200 billion while about N40 billion is allocated to INEC in the annual budgets. Every year we see extra-budgetary allocations to INEC.\u201d\n\nEffects of High Governance Cost\n\nAkabueze examined the effects of high cost of governance on the economy. He asserted that low revenue collections and high recurrent costs, actual capital spending had trended below N2 trillion for a decade.\n\nAccording to him, the investments required to bridge infrastructure gap are way beyond the means available to government.\n\nHe said, \u201cDue to funding constraints, many capital projects are abandoned, or uncompleted.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s huge recurrent expenditure has constrained the provision of good roads, steady power supply, healthcare services, quality education, quality shelter etcetera.\n\n\u201cThis has contributed to observable underperformance of the economy, slow growth and current infrastructural challenges. No country can develop where a large part of its earnings is spent on administrative structures rather than on capital investment.\u201d\n\nHe noted that budget objectives had been difficult to achieve.\n\nAkabueze said, \u201cPoverty rate remains high; NBS\u2019 latest estimate is that 40.1% of the population (82.9 million people) are poor. High poverty is worsened by high unemployment. Unemployment rate increased from 27.1% in Q2 2020 to 33.3% in Q4 2020.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the labour force (56.1%) are unemployed or underemployed. The infrastructure required to translate opportunities in the Nigerian economy to economic value is in deficit.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome address, the chairman of ICPC said the policy dialogue and its concomitant policy brief were part of the key performance indicators in the implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS), 2017-2021 and the Policies, Programmes and Projects Audit Committee (PPPAC) Roadmap (2019 \u2013 2023) adopted by the federal government at the commencement of its second term in 2019.\n\nOwasanoye noted that the documents required that stakeholders be engaged as part of activities \u201cto promote an improved legal, policy and regulatory environment for the fight against corruption\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor us at ICPC, this is not only a stakeholder engagement but a key component of our prevention mandate as we beam the searchlight on one of the drivers of corruption in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the PPPAC document, government committed itself to increase revenue from existing and new sources, improve coordination and cohesion amongst agencies in the revenue generating and expenditure ecosystem, drastically cut costs, including reducing all kinds of subsidies while protecting the poor and vulnerable, reduce the cost of delivering government services by streamlining payroll, reducing cost of contracts and procurement, and improve coordination and avoid duplication of efforts by MDAs etcetera.\n\n\u201cAt a time the nation is facing myriad of challenges, including insecurity, high unemployment, high indebtedness, cost of funding political office holders and a near empty treasury, running such a nerve-wracking, bloated bureaucracy is unwelcome. It is most imperative that urgent steps are taken to address this stunning revelation.\n\n\u201cOverall, it is important to note that the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has so far lived up to its name and mandate.\u201d\n\nThe Owasanoye-led commission has tried to identify loopholes deliberately created by bureaucracy, and it has conducted investigations, arrested culprits, and secured convictions.\n\nThe continuing policy dialogue is a multi-stakeholder approach aimed at finding lasting solutions to the hydra-headed challenge of corruption, and a dialogue that could be adopted nationally to confront the challenge of misgovernance, and widespread corrupt practices.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Suspended Nigeria Ports Authority Manager, Hadiza Bala, was involved in a clandestine ploy to shortchange a company in favour of Africa\u2019s richest, Aliko Dangote, documents obtained by SaharaReporters have revealed.\n\nLast year, some coastline terminals, formerly operated by Integrated Logistics Services\u2019 (INTELs) in Onne ports complex, Rivers State, were confiscated and subsequently awarded to Dangote through a proxy company, International Container Terminal Services (ICTS) Nigeria limited.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nOnne Port Complex is one of the largest Oil and Gas Free Zone in Africa, where major industry players from the exploration up to the completion phases operate.\n\nThe complex has two major terminals: the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) and Federal Lighter Terminal (FLT).\n\nFor over a decade, INTELs Nigeria, partly owned by former Vice president, Atiku Abubakar, operated some berths at the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) of the complex, providing logistics services until 2020.\n\nThe three berths of FOT numbered 9, 10 and were taken over by the NPA in a controversial manner, which many thought was a move by President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration move to witch-hunt Abubakar, his opponent in the 2019 election and break the company\u2019s monopoly.\n\nThe NPA, in September 2020, issued a notice announcing that the service operation handled by the Integrated Logistics Services (Intels) Nigeria had been terminated.\n\nIt further states that all Service Boats Owners and Operators are to do transactions directly in each of the Port Complex of the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nMeanwhile, a memo released to the press, seen by SaharaReporters, showed that Usman had transferred the berths confiscated from INTELs to ICTSI, a proxy company traced to Dangote, five months earlier.\n\nThe leaked memo, dated May 13, was signed by Yusuf Ahmed, NPA\u2019s Director of Lands & Asset Admin, on behalf of Usman.\n\n\u201cPlease refer to the lease of land and berths 9, 10 and 11 granted to you at FOT Onne and find attached herewith the draft Lease Agreement for a review of its possible contents before the final copy is produced for execution,\u201d the letter addressed to the managing director of ICTSI read.

The transfers carried ambiguous descriptions that made it difficult to conclude their purpose.\u201d\n\nMs Bala was recently instructed to step aside for an independent investigation into a series of allegations of impropriety.\n\nNigeria\u2019s transport minister, Rotimi Amaechi, also alleged that the yearly remittance of operating surpluses by the regulatory body from 2016 to 2020 was short of the amount due for actual remittance \u2014 a claim, which according to him, should be investigated.\n\nOn Thursday, no reason was given for the suspension of Usman, who was reappointed for another five-year tenure recently.\n\nShe was first appointed as the Managing Director of NPA in 2016.\n\nAccording to a release by President\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, President Buhari approved the recommendation of the Ministry of Transportation for the setting up of an Administrative Panel of Inquiry to investigate the Management of NPA.\n\n\u201cThe President has also approved that the Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, to step aside while the investigation is carried out.

          "text": "In January 2020, I spoke to Charles, a Nigerian journalist studying in Uganda, and one of the interesting points of our conversation was the \u201cOver the top tax.\u201d The tax, introduced in 2018, means Ugandans pay a daily fee of 200 Shillings to use social media apps.\n\nThe new bill took many people by surprise. According to Charles, \u201cOn July 1st, I was on Facebook, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t. Nothing was working anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spent two hours restarting the Airtel Mifi, switching positions. It was then, at about past 2 a.m, that it struck me. Like \u201cOh damn. This thing is on.\u201d\n\nOne question I asked at the time was, \u201ccan\u2019t you bypass the OTT tax with a free Virtual Private Network?\u201d A VPN lets users send and receive data while remaining anonymous and secure online.\n\nWhile some VPNs were listed as part of the services you had to pay social media taxes for, many Ugandans still used other VPNs and public WiFis to sidestep the tax anyway. While there were genuine concerns that the OTT was another form of censure, the government claimed the tax was a way to raise money.\n\nVincent Semura, who works with the country\u2019s tax authority, confirmed this narrative. \u201cOne of the reasons that this tax was introduced is that we see more and more people using internet data for communication and therefore the telephone companies were losing revenue, as well as the government.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s plan has not played out how it imagined. While the Ugandan government\u2019s projected revenue was about $77.8 million (248 billion Ugandan shillings), it raised only about $13.5 million (49.5 billion shillings).\n\nThe actual cost of the tax has been a reduction in the number of internet users. Three months after the tax, Uganda\u2019s Communications Commission (UCC) data showed that internet users declined by 5 million.\n\nAn even more recent market report from the UCC also showed that the number of internet subscribers who were not paying the tax was at least 7.6m of the target 18.9m subscribers.\n\nIt is clear that the government has not hit its revenue target and has forced millions of people offline with a failed policy. While it has acknowledged the failure of that policy with plans to repeal it, it wants to replace the OTT tax with a broader tax on internet bundles.\n\nNew taxes to generate revenue\n\nA proposed tax on Internet bundles is one of the seven new taxes that the government wants to apply from July 1 if members of parliament approve it.\n\nThe new bill will introduce excise duty on internet data at a rate of 12%, with the exclusion of data used to provide medical and education services. This sort of tax will be near impossible to avoid using VPN.\n\nSince it is charged at the point of buying the data, there is no way around it. If it is passed, the government will move closer to meeting its revenue targets, forcing even more people offline.\n\nWhile Uganda\u2019s population is estimated to be 45 million, there are only 12 million internet users in the country, with a noticeable improvement between 2020 and 2021. Yet these bills, if passed, will hamper progress and increase the digital divide in Uganda.",

The launch marks Paystack\u2019s expansion into its third market, following Nigeria (where it claims it powers over 50% of all online payments), and Ghana.\n\nThis announcement is coming seven months after it was acquired by fintech giant Stripe for $200 million. In 2018, when it raised $8 million Series A it planned to use it for its Ghana expansion.\n\nThe company boasts of having over 60,000 organisations on the continent using its software to collect online payments securely from anyone, anywhere in the world.\n\nFollowing the launch, Paystack will leverage South Africa\u2019s internet connectivity, one of the highest on the continent, to significantly drive up the adoption of digital transactions. Today, despite the country\u2019s impressive connectivity and high smartphone penetration, digital payments account for less than half of all transactions.\n\n\ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 Over the past 6 months, we ran a pilot in South Africa, worked closely with developers and business owners, set up our local team, and powered payments for 100s of businesses.\n\n\n\nToday, we're thrilled to open our doors to everyone \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/IiO4RulMi3 \u2014 Paystack (@paystack) May 6, 2021\n\n\u201cSouth Africa is one of the continent\u2019s most important markets, and our launch here is a significant milestone in our mission to accelerate commerce across Africa,\u201d says Paystack CEO, Shola Akinlade. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to continue building the financial infrastructure that empowers ambitious businesses in Africa, helps them scale, and connects them to global markets.\u201d\n\nThe 6 month pilot\n\nDuring the 6 month pilot in South Africa, Paystack worked closely with several businesses of all types \u2013 tech startups, corporate organisations, ecommerce businesses, freelance developers, and entrepreneurs of all sizes \u2013 and also grew a local team to handle on-the-ground operations.\n\nCape Town-based full-service digital agency Semantica Digital was one of those pilot businesses. CMO Dirk Tolken had this to say: \u201cWith the fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape in e-commerce development, we need service from our partners that we can rely on to maintain the good relationships we have with our clients. Paystack gives us that kind of service.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the launch, Paystack will host a series of live Q&As (one for business owners with Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, and a technical chat for software developers) to answer questions about how Paystack can power growth for ambitious businesses.\n\n\u201cFor many businesses in South Africa, we know that accepting payments online can be cumbersome,\u201d says Khadijah Abu, Head of Product Expansion at Paystack. \u201cOur pilot in South Africa was hyper-focused on removing barriers to entry, eliminating tedious paperwork, providing world-class API documentation to developers, and making it a lot simpler for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n\nTaking it slow and steady\n\nPaystack is often compared to Flutterwave, the other major Nigerian Fintech player. Although their services are similar, their expansion strategy is different. While Flutterwave is in 20 African countries, Paystack which is in only 3 African countries appears to be taking it slow and steady.",

          "title": "Sending money out of Africa is a chore \u2013 Lemonade Finance wants to make it sweet",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nBefore becoming Director of Operations at ORide in 2019, Ridwan Olalere had been around Nigeria\u2019s startup scene for a few years, taking note of big problems.\n\nHe was the fourth senior engineer hired during Flutterwave\u2019s very early 2016 days. It was a great perch for gaining insight into Africa\u2019s untapped e-payments landscape.\n\nIn October 2020, Olalere took the leap from operator to founder. He left Uber as a Country Manager for Nigeria to start Lemonade Finance, \u201ca borderless money app for Africans.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider his undergraduate foundations in aeronautical engineering, it appears Olalere has always had a thing for moving valuables over long distances. At Uber he helped people move around Lagos and Abuja. At Lemonade, he wants to move money from Africa to the world.\n\nBut why Lemonade and why now? Why does Africa need another \u2018borderless\u2019 money app in 2021?\n\nSweetening a sour taste\n\nI have not had a need to send money to Europe. I have no family or dependents there. But Nigerians with children schooling in the UK and other parts of Europe often need to pay school fees or send upkeep money.\n\nThose with second homes in these countries may also want to fund overseas bank accounts for other purposes.\n\nOlalere adds one use case: \u201cYou have a Piggyvest or Risevest account and want to withdraw the money to use it in Europe. What do you do?\u201d\n\nAt the moment, there are not many options for satisfying these needs. If you Google \u201cNigeria to Europe transfers\u201d and visit this clickbaity result, you\u2019re going to be disappointed:\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, we are unable to make transfers from Nigeria to Europe at this time.\u2019\n\nBut Lemonade says \u2018Um\u2026 actually we can\u2019. The app was launched in October 2020 and rransfers to Kenya, Ghana, the UK and banks accounts in Europe have been added.\n\nThe big promise? The transfer will reflect in two to five minutes, not business days or weeks.\n\nHow Lemonade Finance works\n\nIt is easy to sign up for a basic Lemonade Finance account. Inputting my house address was about as vulnerable as I felt. No bank verification number or government-issued ID was required.\n\nTo fund a Lemonade wallet, the app generates a virtual bank account which the user transfers money to from their naira bank account or fintech app.\n\nWhen a user wants to transfer money from their wallet to a foreign account, Lemonade does the currency conversion. In addition to inputting the destination bank account, a sort code is needed. Receiver does not need to download Lemonade; it goes into their bank account.\n\nI just love that @LemonadeFinance is shipping seriously. Wahala for who no dey use #Lemonade oh \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/FrMf3re1Kv \u2014 Prosper Otemuyiwa (@unicodeveloper) May 6, 2021\n\nTo be sure, the Lemonade account I describe above is an entry-level one with a \u20a650,000 limit on amounts that can be sent. As with most fintech apps, Lemonade invites users to upgrade their account by adding more KYC details.\n\nBut instead of relying on BVN (the go-to KYC tool for startups until recently), Lemonade uses third-party identity verification from companies like Jumio and Onfido. The latter is used by Revolut, the UK digital bank.\n\nNormally, this verification process requires the user to take a picture and upload a government ID. Olalere says it is as efficient for KYC purposes as using BVN.\n\nWhat\u2019s the tech in Lemonade?\n\nAll of Lemonade\u2019s stack is in golang, the open source programming language developed by Google.\n\n\u201cWe built out these parts of the app ourselves, most of it in one AWS container,\u201d Olalere says proudly.\n\nLemonade\u2019s Android and iOS apps were built in-house by a team of 4 backend engineers, 3 mobile developers and 1 infrastructure engineer.\n\nLicense and registration\n\nRegulation has been a recurring subject in Nigerian fintech in the first half of 2021. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been especially vigilant against services that move currencies in and out of the country.\n\nLemonade is a remittance business squarely within CBN\u2019s purview. But Olalere believes the regulator\u2019s focus is to stop bad actors. \u201cWe keep dialoguing to make sure we are compliant.\u201d\n\nHe says Lemonade Finance is licensed in Canada as a money service business and has necessary license coverage in the US, UK and Europe to enable Nigerians to send money to bank accounts in those countries.\n\nLemonade has a license partner for inflows into Nigeria. Why not a direct license from the CBN?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time and cost. If you want to get up and running quickly as a startup, you don\u2019t want to wait six to eight months for a license if you can partner with someone who already has it.\u201d\n\nIn any case, this licensing partnership does not mean Lemonade depends on the partner for technology. The partner\u2019s technology downtimes will not affect the startup.\n\nGrowing Lemonade\u2019s user base\n\nIt\u2019ll probably not take long before competitors emerge in Lemonade\u2019s Africa-to-Europe money transfer space (we might hear of \u2018Grape Finance\u2019 or something soon). How will Olalere\u2019s team stay top of mind with existing and prospective users?\n\n\u201cA good cross-border product delivers on time. Our delivery is instant, never next day. We keep working on new rails and we ensure uptime is really high if you want to use it in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold promise, premised on the capacity of a team assembled from Flutterwave and OPay. Lemonade\u2019s growth comes down to them bringing all that expertise to bear and perhaps hoping the CBN stays off their backs.",

          "text": "It is common knowledge now that the red meat value chain in Nigeria needs total over-hauling. From animal production, transportation, processing and storage, to distribution and consumption.\n\nSlaughtering unfit livestock and/or processing in an unhygienic environment is a serious health hazard that leads to the transmission of animal to human diseases. (what is known in medical circle as zoonosis).\n\nIt is to curtail and prevent the above ugly and unfortunate scenario that led to the development of Meat247 by Livestock247.com (Nigeria\u2019s 1st and truly ONLY online livestock platform).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that the medical and mobility history of animals are very important to solve the challenges that come with the safety of animal products for consumption.\n\nThe Meat247 feature was added on Livestock247.com during the lockdown occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic last year to provide consumers in Lagos with an option to buy clean, traceable and wholesome meat at a click, and get it delivered to their addresses of choice. The service has since been launched in Abuja, and is about to be launched in Port Harcourt.\n\nMeat247 is a safe, wholesome and hygienic alternative to traditional dirty and unhealthy meat sources.\n\nDuring our meeting at the company\u2019s HQ at Opebi, Ikeja-Lagos, Dr. Ugochi Izuora, Livestock247.com\u2019s Head of Operations/Quality Control said \u2018\u2019Most of us don\u2019t know that eating meat from unfit for slaughter livestock or processed at unhygienic sources can lead to miscarriages in women, tuberculosis, infertility in both men and women among other diseases\u2026\u201d\n\nShe further added that one of the primary causes of antimicrobial resistance (build-up of antimicrobial resistance in the body) comes from ingesting animal products (Meat, Offal & Milk) from animals that have not maintained the withdrawal period which can make it almost impossible to treat diseases in humans using the current medications available.\n\n(This turns \u2018small illnesses to big problems\u2019 which may lead to death. Imagine someone dying from a \u2018minor\u2019 injury because no drug seems to work on them?)\n\nWith Meat247, Livestock247.com is using technology to provide wholesome meat to consumers with the primary goal of mitigating the spread of animal to human disease transmission and contributing its quota in the fight against Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).\n\nLivestock247.com understands that finding wholesome and hygienically processed meat should be as easy as ordering it, that is why we have built a tech product around the ordering and fulfilment of meat, said Olubodun Akinyele, the company\u2019s CTO.\n\nMeat247 provides wholesome meat in different affordable packages and prices. Consumers can simply order from https://livestock247.com/meat247 or call their customer service line, 0906-290-3550 to order.\n\nThe agritech start-up also has a special credit arrangement with major hotels and restaurant in Lagos and Abuja under their \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 option.\n\nKnowing what I know now, after visiting Livestock247.com, I will only buy meat from sources I can trust.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTechpoint Startup School is coming to Port Harcourt!\n\nFlextock raises $3.25m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nComments\n\nbut struggling to get funding, find co-founders, or build your team?

It can\u2019t happen with the facility in a state of disrepair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come in to do an evaluation and assessment ourselves. The clinic needs to be rehabilitated and re-equipped and the hostels need to be rebuilt and re-equipped for decent habitation. The classroom needs to be rebuilt and the training ground and the obstacles need to be upgraded and repaired,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor further noted that \u201cthe state government is concerned about the state of the security system and cannot leave it for the Federal Government alone. Security is everybody\u2019s concern and as a state government, we have decided to put our money where our mouth is and use what we have to try and solve our problem\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Police Commissioner said that \u201cas a Force, we are happy that this facility is going to be upgraded by the Edo State Government.

It\u2019s not just sustainable to move the majority of our people in cars; we must look at working with your documents in national transportation policy and see how we can begin to encourage mass transit systems.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe are likely to run into some problems soon with the current economic challenges in the country; we need to introduce a mass transit system that will help to cushion the effects on the masses.\n\n\u201cJust like you said, we enjoyed a good cordial working relationship with your agency, particularly the support you have given our own Edo State Traffic Management Agency (EDSTMA). I know you have been quite supportive in terms of capacity building, collaboration and cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe working relationship shows what can be achieved when there is cooperation between the federal and state agencies. We are strategically positioned in terms of federal roads and so the span you have to cover in Edo, I believe has been quite extensive.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cThis is one of the areas that we will continue to look at the agency to collaborate with in order to further strengthen transportation systems of our dear state. I would like to urge you not to retire even though you are formally retired.\n\n\u201cYour experience, the knowledge that you have gathered in the course of your duty must be put to use especially now.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Godwin Ogagaoghene assured Governor Obaseki that he would help in training the state-owned EDSTMA in traffic management and ensure the arrest of traffic offenders.\n\n...",

          "title": "16 police officers killed in Nigeria last week",
          "text": "Targeted attacks on security operatives, particularly police officers, continued in some parts of Nigeria last week leading to the death of, at least, 16 police officers.\n\nA PREMIUM TIMES review of newspaper reports and official statements by public officials shows that the 16 officers were slain in attacks on four different police stations across the South-east and South-south regions of Nigeria. Both regions have in the past few weeks witnessed targeted attacks on security officials and facilities.\n\nThis newspaper had reported how 18 police officers were killed in separate attacks across Nigeria in the previous week.\n\nThe killings and destruction of police facilities started about a month ago and have since continued despite the arrests and killing of some suspects.\n\nIPOB, an outlawed secessionist group, and its security network, ESN, has been blamed for most of the attacks but the group has denied any involvement.\n\nHowever, not all the attacks on police facilities were successful as officials announced the killing of 11 suspected IPOB members during an attack on a police command in Orlu, Imo State, on Thursday.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES highlights the reported cases of attacks on police facilities last week (May 2 to 8).\n\nThe Ebonyi Attack\n\nAt least one police officer was killed as suspected members of ESN in the early hours of Thursday invaded a police facility in Obiozara, Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe attackers were said to have invaded the station at about 3 a.m., and set ablaze the office of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) and the administrative building.\n\nThis newspaper learnt that the main police station in the local government area was burnt down during #EndSARS protest, last year.\n\nThe facility that was attacked was used by the police as their temporary station.\n\nTwo officers in Anambra\n\nTwo police officers were killed during a gun attack on another police facility in Anambra State, Nigeria\u2019s South-east, on Thursday.\n\nThe divisional police station in Obosi, Idemili North Local Government Area of the state, was razed by the gunmen during the attack which occurred in the early hours of the day.\n\nThe police spokesperson in the state, Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the attack to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).\n\nNAN reported that the attackers first razed the station before they raided the police quarters where they killed the two officers.\n\nMr Ikenga, a deputy superintendent of police, said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Chris Owolabi, dispatched a tactical team for on-the-spot assessment of the incident.\n\n\u201cThe tactical team led by an Assistant Commissioner of Police was directed to have an on-the-spot assessment of the place.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe team was equally told to possibly identify and apprehend the hoodlums that perpetrated the attack,\u201d he said.\n\nThe police spokesperson said the bodies of the slain officers have been deposited at a nearby morgue.\n\nHe said the police had launched an investigation into the attack.\n\nFailed Imo Attack\n\nSuspected members of the ESN on Thursday attacked a police facility in Imo State. However, the attackers were repelled and 11 of them were killed, according to an official account.\n\nArmy spokesperson Mohammed Yerima said the gunmen attacked the police area command in Orlu, Imo State, Thursday night.\n\nThey were repelled by the police officers present who were then joined by soldiers and other security operatives.\n\nMr Yerima said no security operative was killed in the attack while 11 of the gunmen were killed. He said seven vehicles and several arms and ammunition were also recovered from the attackers.\n\nSeven officers slain in Rivers\n\nSeven police officers were killed in multiple gun attacks on Friday night in Rivers State, South-south Nigeria.\n\nThe police in the state confirmed the attacks and reported that three police officers were killed in Elimgbu police station, while two others were killed at the divisional police headquarters in Rumuji.\n\nTwo other officers were killed at an attack on a security checkpoint along the East-West Road.\n\nThe police spokesperson in Rivers State, Nnamdi Omoni, said he would make details of the attacks available to reporters after a visit to the scene.\n\nSix slain in Akwa-Ibom\n\nA few hours after the Rivers attack, armed persons carried out a similar attack on a police facility in the neighbouring Akwa Ibom State.\n\nSix police officers were said to have been killed in the Akwa Ibom attack which occurred in the early hours of Saturday at a local police station in Ini Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe police spokesperson in the state, Odiko MacDon, confirmed the attack to PREMIUM TIMES, Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe gunmen razed a part of the police station.\n\n\u201cThey (the gunmen) went to the police quarters where the police officers were sleeping and shot them dead,\u201d a state government official said.\n\nExpert Speaks\n\nA security expert and former spokesperson of the Nigerian Army, Sani Usman, while commenting on the attacks urged governments to tackle the menace before it gets out of hand.\n\nThe retired brigadier general added that the attacks are not good for the security of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is not good for the peace and security of this nation. Therefore, there is urgent need to evolve and implement strategies to stem it before it escalates beyond this,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Fitch affirms FBN Holdings\u2019 Ratings at \u2018B-\u2018/Negative after board removal by CBN",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nInternational ratings agency, Fitch, has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of FBN Holdings Plc (FBNH) and its primary operating subsidiary, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd (FBN), at \u2018B-\u2018 with a Negative Outlook, after the change of the bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe affirmation, Fitch said in an article on Friday, reflects is view that the impact of the CBN replacement of FBNH and FBN\u2019s boards, the identification of corporate governance failings and the imposition of corrective measures are tolerable at the rating level.\n\n\u201cWe have assessed the near-term financial impact of these actions on FBNH and FBN and believe this is tolerable at the rating level, even though the final outcome is uncertain. In our view, any remedial actions imposed by the CBN, including a potential reclassification of related-party exposures as impaired, will not have a material effect on the group\u2019s asset quality, profitability and capitalisation,\u201d Fitch said in the article published on its website.\n\n\u201cHowever, this does not consider any possible additional actions by the CBN, especially if FBN fails to implement the regulator\u2019s corrective measures or if there were any further uncovering of corporate governance irregularities.\u201d\n\nFitch said, the Outlook remains Negative, reflecting FBNH\u2019s pre-existing asset quality and capitalisation weaknesses as well as the group\u2019s corporate governance weaknesses highlighted by the CBN. These could put pressure on the ratings.\n\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\n\nAccording to Fitch, FBNH is the non-operating holding company that owns FBN. FBNH\u2019s ratings are aligned with those of FBN (which represents around 90% of consolidated group assets) due to high capital and liquidity fungibility within the group, and low double leverage (at 95% at end-1H20) at the holding company level.\n\nFBNH\u2019s IDR is driven by its intrinsic creditworthiness, as defined by its \u2018b-\u2018 Viability Rating (VR). The rating considers the group\u2019s exposure to Nigeria\u2019s volatile operating environment and also factors in vulnerability in its capital position in the context of moderate earnings generation and asset-quality pressures, where headroom above the minimum regulatory capital requirements is also moderate. Capitalisation is a factor of high importance to the VR.\n\nThe new boards appointed to FBNH and FBN comprise individuals with sufficient experience and expertise. However, we view such major change as hugely disruptive. There are no changes in FBNH and FBN\u2019s executive management team.\n\nWe believe the governance shortcomings cited by the CBN reflect poorly on FBNH\u2019s reputation and on the group\u2019s governance and control practices. As a result, we have revised down our assessment of FBNH\u2019s Management and Strategy score to \u2018b-\u2018 from \u2018b\u2019.\n\nWe also assigned a negative outlook to this factor, which reflects the uncertainty surrounding additional remedial actions that the CBN may impose due to these related party exposures as well as the potential for further uncovering of governance irregularities. It also captures the lack of track record of the new board and its ability to restore confidence in FBNH and FBN.\n\nAsset quality remains a rating weakness. FBNH reported an improved impaired loan ratio of 7.9% at end-1Q21 (end-2020: 7.7%). However, FBNH\u2019s reported reserve coverage of 54.5% at end-1Q21 (end-2020: 48%) remains significantly weaker than domestic peers\u2019. Our assessment indicates that if the related-party loan highlighted by the CBN were classified as impaired, the ratio would be unlikely to be above 10% (excluding any new impaired loan generation from ordinary business).\n\nCapitalisation remains a rating weakness and has a high influence on the ratings. FBN reported a capital adequacy ratio of 16.6% at end-1Q21 (excluding interim profits), which provides limited headroom above its 15% minimum regulatory requirement. In addition, FBNH\u2019s capitalisation metrics remain vulnerable to asset-quality risks given significant capital encumbrance by unreserved impaired loans.\n\nFBNH\u2019s profitability metrics typically lag behind those of the other large banks, mainly due to high loan impairment charges. In our view, the corrective measures, including higher provisioning on related-party loans or the sale of \u2018non-permissible\u2019 equity investments, would not materially affect profitability in the near term.\n\nOur conversations with FBNH give us to understand there has been no adverse effect from recent events on its funding and liquidity profile, which remains healthy. FBNH\u2019s funding profile continues to benefit from a substantial customer deposit base, which provides around 75% of its non-equity funding.\n\nSENIOR DEBT\n\nFBN\u2019s senior debt issued by FBN Finance Company BV is rated in line with the bank\u2019s Long-Term IDR, as the notes ultimately represent unconditional, senior unsecured obligations of the bank, which rank pari passu with its other senior unsecured obligations.\n\nUnless otherwise stated above, the key drivers of FBNH\u2019s other ratings and the ratings of its subsidiaries are in line with our most recent Rating Action Commentary (See \u201cFitch Affirms FBN Holdings Plc at \u2018B-\u2018; off RWN; Outlook Negative\u201d published on 5 October 2020).\n\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:\n\nThe ratings of FBNH would be downgraded if the corporate governance shortcomings highlighted by the CBN persist and if any further weaknesses are uncovered, potentially leading to a greater financial impact.\n\nReputational repercussions that would make it harder for FBNH to meet its pre-tax profit growth ambitions, or significant adjustments to the group\u2019s management and strategy, could also contribute to rating pressure.\n\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:\n\nUpside to the ratings is unlikely at present.\n\nBEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO\n\nInternational scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from \u2018AAA\u2019 to \u2018D\u2019. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.",
          "summary": "KEY RATING DRIVERSAccording to Fitch, FBNH is the non-operating holding company that owns FBN.\nWe believe the governance shortcomings cited by the CBN reflect poorly on FBNH\u2019s reputation and on the group\u2019s governance and control practices.\nIt also captures the lack of track record of the new board and its ability to restore confidence in FBNH and FBN.\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:Upside to the ratings is unlikely at present.\nThe complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from \u2018AAA\u2019 to \u2018D\u2019.",

He now brought one that has me only as the major picture at the back of the magazine.\n\n\u201cHe said \u201cwhat of this? I said \u201cwe don\u2019t buy paper\u201d. That was in 1999. I\u2019ve not found out what they wrote there. I don\u2019t have that time sir. Since 1999 I\u2019ve not asked any mortal man what they wrote about me. You\u2019re writing about me, I know me more than you.\n\n\u201cThey brought a paper to my house, the editor says he lives in Gowon Estate and so he gave me an advanced copy. I said \u201cI don\u2019t read paper\u201d. He said \u201cit\u2019s free\u201d. I said \u201cI don\u2019t read paper, go to our office you\u2019ll meet one man there\u201d, he is the one who reads our papers.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ve not found out what was in that paper.

          "text": "Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom on Saturday described Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna as a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him.\n\nOrtom added that the Kaduna governor was one of the \u201cvery few persons\u201d who misled President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOrtom stated this while reacting to the statement credited to El-Rufai, where the latter reportedly accused the Benue Governor of attacking the federal government to cover for his failure to secure Benue state.\n\nHowever, a statement signed by Ortom\u2019s spokesman, Terver Akase, said El-Rufai made such a comment to get back into the good books of the president.\n\nThe statement added that El-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to make such a comment owing to the insecurity and other challenges in Kaduna.\n\nPlease read Ortom\u2019s full statement on El-Rufai below:\n\nEL-RUFAI IS ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE MISLED PRESIDENT BUHARI\n\nWe read the statement credited to Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai in which he accused Governor Samuel Ortom of using the insecurity in his state to attack the Federal Government in order to cover up what he termed as the Benue State Governor\u2019s failure.\n\nWe want to believe that El-Rufai was wrongly quoted. A man who has failed in several aspects as Governor of Kaduna has no moral justification to accuse another Governor.\n\nA Governor who has divided the good people of Kaduna against one another by not hiding his hatred of indigenes of the state on account of religion and ethnicity is not qualified to judge another Governor on any issue whatsoever. A Governor who chose a Muslim deputy in a state where Christians have a huge population is certainly not one to preach unity and peaceful co-existence.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s attack on Governor Ortom is merely to make him look good before the Presidency. He has apparently fallen out of favour at the Villa and wants to use Governor Ortom as a launchpad back to reckoning. How has he handled his own problems in Kaduna? This is a man who has insulted almost every prominent Nigerian including the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and former President Olusegun Obasanjo; a man who is his former boss and one who brought him to the limelight.\n\nNigerians have not forgotten the unprintable things El-Rufai said during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s time as President. He insulted the then President and publicly supported terrorists attacking parts of the country. His statements on the abduction of Chibok girls and several other acts of terrorism are still fresh in our minds. El-Rufai is on record to have said repeatedly that Fulani people must retaliate any wrong done to them no matter how long it takes.\n\nIs Governor Ortom responsible for El-Rufai\u2019s inability to ensure peace in Kaduna State where bandits have taken over some communities while kidnappings and killings occur on daily basis?\n\nEl-Rufai admitted to paying Fulani herdsmen whom he invited from other West African countries in the name of stopping attacks in Southern Kaduna. Since he made the confessional statement, attacks on the people of Southern Kaduna have escalated. This is why he wants men of good conscience like Governor Ortom to be silent to pave way for the conquest and expansion agenda to succeed.\n\nKidnapping has become a common crime in Kaduna State under Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nAside the much celebrated cases, it has been estimated that at every given time, not less that 300 persons are abducted in Kaduna by kidnappers who are always identified as El-Rufai\u2019s kinsmen. He pays them billions to embolden them. He has turned the state into one of the most unsafe places to live in Nigeria today.\n\nTalking about taking someone seriously, if other Nigerians take El-Rufai seriously, we in Benue do not do same. A man who has no regard for humanity does not deserve our attention.\n\nNasir el-Rufai is a sycophant, ethnic champion and religious bigot who hates anyone who does not share the same faith with him. He is among the very few persons who have misled President Muhammadu Buhari. El-Rufai is one of the real enemies of this country who do not hide their divisive tendencies by elevating nepotism and ethnicity above the good values that have held Nigeria together over the decades.\n\nNasir el-Rufai doesn\u2019t possess the credentials to counsel anyone on payment of salaries and the welfare of workers. This is a Governor who recently sacked 4,000 workers for no just cause. He ought to be ashamed of himself. What happened to the lofty promises he made to Kaduna people in 2015?\n\nThe Kaduna Governor should know that only two days ago, the people of Benue State met at a stakeholders meeting in Makurdi and unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Ortom in recognition of his performance. That meeting was attended across party lines with leaders of All Progressives Congress, APC also present.",

At one point, the police entered one of the buildings in the complex, which includes the Al-Aqsa mosque and the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service said 88 of the wounded were hospitalised. The Palestinian Health Ministry said 83 people were wounded by rubber-coated bullets, including three who were shot in the eye, two with serious head injuries and two with broken jaws.\n\nThe Israeli police said protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at them, wounding 17 officers, half of whom were hospitalized.\n\n\u201cWe will respond with a heavy hand to all violent disturbances, riots and attacks on our forces,\u201d it said in a statement late Friday.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam. It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the biblical temples. It has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was the epicenter of the 2000 Palestinian intifada, or uprising.\n\nSome 70,000 worshippers had attended the final midday Friday prayers of Ramadan at Al-Aqsa, the Islamic endowment that oversees the site said. Thousands protested afterwards, waving the green flags of the Islamic militant group Hamas and chanting pro-Hamas slogans.\n\nAt the beginning of Ramadan in mid-April, Israel blocked off a popular gathering spot where Palestinians traditionally socialize at the end of their daylong fast. The move set off two weeks of clashes before Israel lifted the restrictions.\n\nBut in recent days, protests have grown over Israel\u2019s threatened eviction in Sheikh Jarrah in east Jerusalem of dozens of Palestinians embroiled in a long legal battle with Israeli settlers trying to acquire property in the neighborhood.\n\nEgypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, condemned its actions, as did the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, which was one of four Arab countries that signed U.S.-brokered normalization agreements with Israel last year.\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians are bracing for more unrest in the coming days.",
          "summary": "A night of heavy clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound and elsewhere in Jerusalem left more than 200 Palestinians wounded, as the city braced for even more violence after weeks of unrest.\nThroughout the night large groups of protesters could be seen hurling rocks as Israeli police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades.\nAt one point, the police entered one of the buildings in the complex, which includes the Al-Aqsa mosque and the iconic golden Dome of the Rock.\nThe Israeli police said protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at them, wounding 17 officers, half of whom were hospitalized.\nThe Al-Aqsa mosque compound is the third holiest site in Islam.",

          "text": "A blast close to a secondary school in the Afghan capital Kabul has left at least 30 people dead and dozens more injured, officials have said.\n\nThe bombing, apparently aimed to cause maximum civilian carnage, adds to fears that violence in the war-wrecked country could escalate as the US and NATO end nearly 20 years of military engagement.\n\nWhile no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, the Afghan Islamic State affiliate has targeted the Shiite neighborhood before.\n\nThe radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan\u2019s minority Shiite Muslims. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.\n\nIn Dasht-e-Barchi, angry crowds attacked the ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.\n\nImages circulating on social media purportedly showed bloodied school backpacks and books strewn across the street in front if the school, and smoke rising above the neighborhood.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters in a message that only the Islamic State group could be responsible for such a heinous crime. Mujahid also accused Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence agency of being complicit with IS, although he offered no evidence.\n\nThe Taliban and the Afghan government have traded accusations over a series of targeted killings of civil society workers, journalists and Afghan professionals. While IS has taken responsibility for some of those killings, many have gone unclaimed.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a statement condemning the attack, blaming the Taliban even as they denied it. He offered no proof.\n\nIS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.\n\nThe attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.",
