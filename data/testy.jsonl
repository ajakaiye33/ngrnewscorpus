Effective security, effective information. There is no president who will want his country in chaos. Have you seen one? Point one to me. There is no one that will want his citizens exposed to banditry and danger.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no president or leader that will want his nation fractured by tribalism, religious differences and all that. It calls for serious management and serious evaluation and dialogue once in a while. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the agenda of his visit, he said, \u201cIt is to generally review the perceptions going on outside there and equally focus on the security across the country more. He will have more information than we have, but we are his ears close to the ground and we have to exchange views so that a better Nigeria is grounded. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the best way forward, he replied, \u201cThe best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people. The welfare of our people is extremely important.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times. How we communicate it to the people, what are the areas to help make it easier for people to bear, those are ideas on how to be able to change the leadership of the country.\u201d\n\nFurther asked to comment on the insinuation that he has an unhealthy relationship with the President, the APC helmsman said his relationship with the President remains cordial.\n\nAccording to him,\u201dNothing like that, nothing like unhealthy (relationship with the President). Who, is our doctor? Is it social media that is measuring the relationship? I don\u2019t have to disturb him (Buhari) openly on camera, is it? No, we have so many ways to look at issues. We have nothing like that.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that his relationship is \u201cVery close and cordial, frank and honest.\u201d\n\nFielding question on the chances of the APC to return to power after the tenure of President Buhari in 2023, Asiwaju Tinubu said though he didn\u2019t want to predict what would happen then, the chances were bright.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to predict that one (chances of the APC retaining power at the centre after President Buhari) right now, I don\u2019t want to do that subject now. The chances are as bright as a midnight star. We will continue to work for a better Nigeria and that is what you need.\n\n\u201cWe cannot interject politics and assumption into everything, we have a nation to build, we have a baton to pass. You can depend on Buhari that he will not spend one hour beyond his tenure. He will do that, he will comply with the Constitution. So, how it happens?

{"title": "Nigerian lawmakers debate insecurity as senator says 42 Niger communities occupied by Boko Haram", "text": "Nigerian senators on Tuesday asked the leadership of the National Assembly to have a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari and brief him on the state of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThis was one of the many resolutions adopted by the lawmakers after deliberations on kidnappings and banditry across the nation.\n\nDuring the debate, a Niger State senator told his colleagues that 42 communities in the state were being occupied by Boko Haram.\n\nIn his contribution, Opeyemi Bamidele, a senator from Ekiti State, asked the Senate to \u201cmandate the leadership of the National Assembly to book an appointment with the Commander-In-Chief on behalf of the 109 senators\u2026because I\u2019m not convinced that Mr President is aware of everything that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026we need to be able to tell our constituents that we met with the commander-in-chief and this is what is being done,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bamidele was suggesting an addendum to the resolution on insecurity \u2013 which was adopted.\n\nThe lawmakers also resolved to invite the Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Attahiru, and heads of other security agencies for a meeting with the Senate.\n\nIn the same vein, the Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs and National Security were mandated to meet with the minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and the Director-General of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar, on the implications of the insecurity in Niger State.\n\nThe Debate\n\nThe resolutions were sequel to a motion on the activities of Boko Haram insurgents in Niger State. The motion was sponsored by Sani Musa (APC, Niger East).\n\nThe motion came barely 24 hours after the Niger State governor, Abubakar Bello, confirmed that Boko Haram has hoisted its flags in Kaure and Shiroro local government areas of the state \u2013 about 140km to the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nWhile he called for a more coordinated military action to fight the terrorists, Mr Bello warned that Kaure is less than two hours drive from Abuja and \u201cnobody is safe anymore, not even those in Abuja.\u201d\n\nLeading the debate on Tuesday, Mr Musa noted that the Senate has made several resolutions, set up an ad-hoc committee on security, appropriated budget and also advanced numerous steps to support Nigeria\u2019s security agencies.\n\nHe said the negative effects of the atrocities committed by the bandits include the total collapse of the local economies of the affected communities, the total collapse of the educational system, famine, displacement, depopulation, social vices, trauma arising from serial rape cases and inhumane, cruel and deadly subjugation.\n\n\u201cAbout 42 communities across the two local government areas of Shiroro and Munya Local Government have so far fallen under the Boko Haram control with about 5,000 villagers already displaced in the last three days.\n\n\u201cThey have kidnapped many and their wives seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members. Three military camps in Allawa, Bassa and Zagzaga in the two local government areas have been sacked and some security personnel killed by the insurgents in the last one month of renewed attacks.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram terrorists have mounted their flags in many of the villages they have captured such as Kaure, Alawa and Magami,\u201d he said.\n\nContributions\n\nLawmakers took turns to condemn the killings across the country. Over 15 senators made their contributions to the motion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported the worsening security situation across the country with over 200 people killed last week and over 44 others kidnapped.\n\nBima Enagi (APC, Niger North) said Nigerians cannot continue to bear the pain of women being raped and forcibly married to Boko Haram terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to allow Boko Haram to mount flags in Nigerian territories. What is our army doing? What are all security agencies doing? It has become so shameful that a great country like Nigeria will be in this type of terrible situation.\n\n\u201cIt seems the federal government is handling this insecurity situation with kid gloves. People are dying every day and nothing is being done. No serious, concrete situation on the ground to confront these people.\u201d\n\nIke Ekweremadu, an Enugu senator, warned that any government that cannot protect its citizens has lost legitimacy.\n\nHe also said Nigeria should not be ashamed to seek international support.\n\n\u201cTime has come for us to, if possible, shut down this senate and find a lasting solution to this,\u201d he said.\n\nBiodun Olujimi, an Ekiti senator, wondered why Nigeria recently sent out security officials for peacekeeping in another country when we cannot keep our own peace.\n\nThe bloodletting, she said, is out of hand.\n\n\u201cThere is lack of political will to handle insecurity. None of us here can say we know the process that this government is taking to handle insecurity.\n\n\u201cThere is also lack of leadership. New service chiefs have come. Have we told them what to do and given them a timeline?\u201d\n\nOther resolutions\n\nThe Senate, thereafter, called on the army chief and the Inspector General of Police to immediately deploy troops to defend the unarmed populace and bring back security to the affected communities.\n\nThey lawmakers called for a permanent military and police command base in the area adjoining Shiroro and Rafi local government areas respectively and to redesign the modus operandi of the military operations within the affected areas so as to curtail the escalating insecurity.\n\nThe lawmakers asked the president to order for massive recruitment of police officers and other security personnel.", "summary": "During the debate, a Niger State senator told his colleagues that 42 communities in the state were being occupied by Boko Haram.\nThe DebateThe resolutions were sequel to a motion on the activities of Boko Haram insurgents in Niger State.\n\u201cThey have kidnapped many and their wives seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.\n\u201cBoko Haram terrorists have mounted their flags in many of the villages they have captured such as Kaure, Alawa and Magami,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe cannot continue to allow Boko Haram to mount flags in Nigerian territories.", "link": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/457884-nigerian-lawmakers-debate-insecurity-as-senator-says-42-niger-communities-occupied-by-boko-haram.html", "published": "04/27/2021", "run": "04/27/2021", "keywords": ["haram", "niger", "insecurity", "local", "nigerian", "senator", "boko", "areas", "state", "debate", "security", "communities", "occupied", "lawmakers", "senate"]}

Effective security, effective information. There is no president who will want his country in chaos. Have you seen one? Point one to me. There is no one that will want his citizens exposed to banditry and danger.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no president or leader that will want his nation fractured by tribalism, religious differences and all that.

He will have more information than we have, but we are his ears close to the ground and we have to exchange views so that a better Nigeria is grounded. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the best way forward, he replied, \u201cThe best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people. The welfare of our people is extremely important.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times.

Who, is our doctor? Is it social media that is measuring the relationship? I don\u2019t have to disturb him (Buhari) openly on camera, is it? No, we have so many ways to look at issues. We have nothing like that.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that his relationship is \u201cVery close and cordial, frank and honest.\u201d\n\nFielding question on the chances of the APC to return to power after the tenure of President Buhari in 2023, Asiwaju Tinubu said though he didn\u2019t want to predict what would happen then, the chances were bright.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to predict that one (chances of the APC retaining power at the centre after President Buhari) right now, I don\u2019t want to do that subject now. The chances are as bright as a midnight star.

{"title": "Osinbajo: Nigeria will Overcome Current Security Challenges", "text": "Says nation\u2019s security architecture being re-organised\n\nBy Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo has given an assurance that Nigeria will soon overcome the current security challenges it is facing.\n\nHe also disclosed that the nation\u2019s security architecture is being re-organised with a view to achieving optimal result.\n\nThe vice-president, according to a release issued on Tuesday by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, stated this while playing host to His Royal Majesty, Yakanaje Uke in Nasarawa State, Alhaji Ahmed Abdullahi Hassan, with a promise that the present challenges will prepare Nigeria for a greater and prosperous future, urging the traditional institution to support the re-engineering process.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe strongly that the reason why we are experiencing what we are going through today is because we are being prepared for the future. A future where we will take into account all of the problems because if we haven\u2019t gone through the problems we are going through now, it will be difficult for us to appreciate the importance of fairness and justice, the importance of giving people a voice and a representation.

The role of the leadership is to sit down to think through the problems.\n\n\u201cThis is a big country, so policing is very difficult. There is a need for us to reorganize our security architecture, which is what is going on now.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why we have some of the divisions and conflicts in the parts of the country is because people do not feel included in the management of affairs in their localities.\u201d\n\nCommending the emir for his leadership style, the vice-president said: \u201cI think you have created an opportunity where the options are available for bringing appeals to a centre of fairness and justice for people from across the country, and its one that is to be emulated.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that this is the way Nigeria should be.

{"title": "Jennie Nwokoye and Itoro Inoyo are bringing hospital-to-home services to rural communities in Nigeria", "text": "\u201cNo matter your race, gender or socioeconomic status, health is a fundamental human right and no one should be left out\u201d\n\nThis was said by Itoro Inoyo, co-founder of Clafiya, in one of Clafiya\u2019s explainer videos on YouTube.\n\nIn more developed nations, Itoro\u2019s words would be accepted as an unarguable truth, but in a developing country like Nigeria with a laggard healthcare sector, her words only apply to a small crop of individuals who can afford healthcare.\n\nThe situation surrounding the Nigerian healthcare system has deteriorated such that the president and other politicians can\u2019t risk receiving medical care in the country.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, spent more than three months abroad for a medical trip. His most recent trip happened a few weeks ago. A crucial question here is this: if Nigeria\u2019s president \u2013 the most powerful man in the country \u2013 can\u2019t access proper medical care in the country, how can the average citizen access quality healthcare? Nigerians worry that Buhari\u2019s frequent medical trips abroad are an indication that the country\u2019s healthcare system is far from getting fixed.\n\nTrying to bridge the healthcare gap in Nigeria, Jennie conceived Clafiya\n\nJennie Nwokoye nurtured an idea to build a medical system to cater to the Nigerian population when she was younger. She wasn\u2019t able to put a proper framework around her idea until she began studying for her master\u2019s degree in system engineering and management at Georgetown University.\n\nThough her American accent might suggest otherwise, Jennie lived in Nigeria from when she was 8 and left when she was 14 years old. Growing up in an affluent family meant that her parents tried to shield her from the various issues that plagued Nigeria. But Jennie was an inquisitive teenager who was sensitive enough to know that access to healthcare in the country was and is still impossible for the larger populace.\n\n\u201cImagine having family members or friends who have either died or had close calls because they weren\u2019t able to get access to healthcare,\u201d Jennie tells me during our chat.\n\n\u201cSo that was a profound experience that had stayed with me all this time and has become something I want to solve.\u201d She wanted to build a system outside of a hospital setting because, according to her, \u201cthere are ways to adjust this problem and you don\u2019t necessarily have to be a doctor to do that.\u201d Her hunger to figure out how to address the healthcare problem in Nigeria, is what gave birth to Clafiya.\n\nMeeting Itoro and leveraging partnership\n\nJennie met Itoro at a concert in 2016. They had lengthy conversations about the Nigerian labour market and access to healthcare services in the country. Itoro told me that Clafiya was initially called \u201cHealthcare Mobile\u201d in 2019 and that she was Jennie\u2019s go-to person for information concerning delivery and medical services in Nigeria.\n\nItoro Inoyo has worked in the healthcare sector for several years. She studied at the University of Massachusetts Lowell where she got a bachelor\u2019s degree in biological science. She also obtained a master\u2019s degree in public health from Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health.\n\nAlthough she wasn\u2019t officially a co-founder yet, Itoro\u2019s candid advice to Jennie at the initial stage came from her wealth of experience as she has travelled through sub-rural communities in Nigeria following her work as a gender and PED analyst.\n\nA turning point in their working relationship came in 2020 when Itoro discovered a pitch competition led by Women in Global Health.\n\n\u201cWe applied for that, and people assumed we were co-founders. We had a great working relationship and so we decided to do it.\u201d\n\nClafiya ended up winning the grant.\n\nThe winner of the #BuildBackBetterChallenge for their digital innovation is\u2026@Clafiya1!!!\n\n\n\nWe are so excited to present Clafiya with a prize of $20K to implement and market their innovation. Can't wait to see the impact of your digital health solution#COVID5050 @NovartisFDN pic.twitter.com/gS2wQraYkP \u2014 Women In Global Health (@womeninGH) November 19, 2020\n\nHow Clafiya works\n\nClafiya is a digital platform that connects patients in semi-urban and rural areas to Community Health Workers (CHWs). It provides primary care services to people from the comfort of their homes.\n\n\u201cWith our short USSD code, Nigerians with limited access to primary care services can register, pay, and request for the nearest registered CHW to administer home-based services,\u201d says Jennie.\n\nClafiya leverages AI to apply predictive analytics to geotagged USSD messages for disease surveillance of emerging disease outbreaks in rural and remote regions.\n\nThis also enables government agencies and policy-makers to make data-driven decisions on resource allocation in impacted regions.\n\nThere are two processes to gain access to the platform, the registration process and the appointment scheduling process.\n\nUsing USSD, a potential customer will dial the codes *347*58# and then proceed to answer a few personal questions. Once you have successfully registered on the platform, you\u2019ll receive a text message, and will be led to buy a plan.\n\nClafiya has four different plans: Basic (Pay As You Go), Single Plan, Maternity Care, and Family. After a prospective Clafiya user picks and pays for a plan, they are registered on the platform and enabled to schedule appointments.\n\nThe Basic, otherwise known as pay as you go (PAYG) plan costs \u20a62000 ($4.9). Jennie says the PAYG plan was designed to enable people to pay out of their pockets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that as we penetrate these communities, people would subscribe to what I would call the quasi insurance plan, where the prices start at \u20a63000 ($7.3) for a single plan but that covers all of the primary care services that we are providing except the maternity care plan.\u201d\n\nThe maternity package costs \u20a63500 ($8.5). The most expensive medical package is the family plan at \u20a65000 ($12.2).\n\nTesting stage and gaining access\n\nJennie said in our chat that Clafiya was built to meet customers wherever they are.\n\nIn their field analyses and initial testing stage, Itoro revealed that a lot of Nigerians, especially women, were afraid to go to healthcare facilities. This, she said, was due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to build a solution that can potentially work for the everyday Nigerian, even if you\u2019re in a higher socioeconomic status.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, a large percentage of the population is still not connected to the internet so as much as the internet business is scaling, a huge number of people are being left behind.\n\nItoro said \u201cClafiya wanted to meet the needs of populations that the majority of systems have forgotten. That\u2019s why we decided to do home-based services to bring those services to people\u2019s doorsteps.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is building apps, right? And the average Nigerian, although they have a phone, may not have a smartphone, if you have a smartphone, you may not have data, if you have data, you may have network issues that limits access to the service. USSD is the closest way to read the minority population.\u201d\n\nThe Clafiya team has done their research, tested their tools, and according to them, one of the things people really seem to like about the USSD service is that it allows them to be in the driver\u2019s seat of their health. They get to call the healthcare workers who come to the services and totally be in control of who attends to them and at what time.\n\nBuilding Clafiya as women\n\nClafiya is currently running in Enugu, a state in the southeastern part of Nigeria and while they are planning to expand into other parts of the country, it took quite an effort to get the proper data needed to access potential customers. Jennie loves to put it that they were \u201cshamelessly\u201d going to government offices and waiting for long hours in order to get the data they needed.\n\nBuilding confidence as a woman is one way to scale through some huddles when dealing with people.\n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t take me seriously just because I\u2019m a woman. They look at me as a small girl. But I think once you\u2019re able to present the facts and you\u2019re serious about it, they tend to take you a little bit more seriously,\u201d Jennie told me.\n\nItoro also said leveraging on existing relationships she has with healthcare workers has made their journey a lot easier.\n\nWhy Clafiya is different\n\nThey are not in Lagos.\n\nIn Nigeria, every major tech startup will likely have its audience base in Lagos. With home-grown startups like Flutterwave and Paystack, Lagos is arguably Africa\u2019s most attractive tech hub for talent, opportunities and investors.\n\nWhile Lagos has the largest market size for any kind of business in Nigeria, other communities are often left out when new initiatives and technologies come to Nigeria.\n\nThe decision to start off in Enugu is so that the broader Nigerian population can have access to the service and not be left out. However, moving forward, Clafiya plans to expand to other communities in Nigeria.\n\nJennie and Itoro say the major objective of building the product is so they can prove that access to quality health is a fundamental right for everyone, no matter your race, gender, or socioeconomic status.", "summary": "Trying to bridge the healthcare gap in Nigeria, Jennie conceived ClafiyaJennie Nwokoye nurtured an idea to build a medical system to cater to the Nigerian population when she was younger.\nThough her American accent might suggest otherwise, Jennie lived in Nigeria from when she was 8 and left when she was 14 years old.\n\u201cImagine having family members or friends who have either died or had close calls because they weren\u2019t able to get access to healthcare,\u201d Jennie tells me during our chat.\nThey had lengthy conversations about the Nigerian labour market and access to healthcare services in the country.\nItoro told me that Clafiya was initially called \u201cHealthcare Mobile\u201d in 2019 and that she was Jennie\u2019s go-to person for information concerning delivery and medical services in Nigeria.", "link": "https://techcabal.com/2021/04/27/jennie-and-itoro-nigerian-mobile-healthcare-service-founders/", "published": "04/27/2021", "run": "04/27/2021", "keywords": ["healthcare", "nwokoye", "inoyo", "bringing", "medical", "nigeria", "access", "plan", "services", "jennie", "hospitaltohome", "rural", "communities", "health", "itoro", "clafiya"]}

It explains how banks should enrol and verify customers for BVNs, and how institutions can access the BVN system.\n\nBVNs \u2013 unique identification numbers for bank customers \u2013 were launched in 2014 by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bankers\u2019 Committee as a \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d (KYC) infrastructure for the financial sector.\n\nThe ambition was noteworthy: to create a biometric-based standard for verifying client identity and enabling safe, seamless electronic payments. That standard was actually supposed to be the National Identification Number (NIN) but banks floated BVNs following several government delays on the NIN project.\n\nCombating fraud in the system\n\nBVN has become a core pillar of Nigeria\u2019s anti-money laundering and combating of financial terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. It has driven the rise of Nigerian fintech; payments, savings, lending and even cryptocurrency startups have relied on it.\n\nAmong its other powers, NIBSS determines who can and cannot have access to BVNs. Some weeks ago, they showed this power by cutting some fintechs off the BVN system.\n\nReactions swirled that it was a move by deposit money banks (who co-own NIBSS) to protect themselves against competition from fintechs. But according to a highly placed source at a bank, the move was a necessary response to \u201calarming proportions\u201d of fraud that have been traced to December 2020.\n\nThe short version of the fraud story is that when an individual at virtually any commercial bank in Nigeria opened an account, a fraudster who has got access to their BVN and account number would call them on the phone.\n\nIt is not clear how fraudsters get remote access to customer information but the problem only affected customers who opened or reactivated bank accounts from around the middle of December.\n\nThe fraudster would have downloaded the customer\u2019s bank app. To take control of the account, they would ask the customer to hand over a one-time password sent by the bank.\n\nThe scam was being attempted on anyone including some bank staff, the source said. But banks were alarmed because a major target group was serving members of Nigeria\u2019s National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nNYSC mobilises about 250,000 Nigerian graduates each year and is a source of new accounts for banks.\n\nIn that framing, NIBSS\u2019s new 49-page document clarifies and tightens the BVN system for the safety of Nigeria\u2019s financial system.\n\nAccess to the BVN database\n\nBanks and fintechs access the BVN database through Application Programming Interface (API) calls. The CBN approves groups who can access BVN information, while NIBSS manages the security of the APIs.\n\nThere are two tiers of access: tier 1 and tier 2. Both are differentiated by the need for CBN approval and the number of data fields they can access.\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO of VerifyME, explains that NIBSS gives different levels of access to cater to different use cases. Banks have access to more demographic data because their operating license imposes strict KYC and AML requirements.\n\nApart from banks, any organisation that wants to access customers\u2019 information must first get customers\u2019 consent.\n\nThis consent is split into two; one for demographic data and another for details like account number and names in different banks. When an organisation needs any of these details, NIBSS will notify customers, indicating what their consent is being asked for.\n\nFintechs cannot store BVN data on their database for later use. So if there is downtime at NIBSS, there will be no alternative way to do verifications with vendors until the service is back up.\n\nAguele says this is a reasonable requirement for data security in line with Nigeria\u2019s Data Protection Regulation. But he thinks there should be more clarity from NIBSS on how fair the playing field will be under the guidelines.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that NIBSS is a private institution and should not be regulating data access to companies that could potentially be their competitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these fintechs are releasing products that will compete with what NIBSS offers to banks; CBN still needs to update the framework to cater to this reality.\u201d\n\nVerifyMe offers a facial recognition service that is in competition with NIBSS\u2019s product. With NIBSS in control of some of the data useful for that purpose, Aguele believes an antitrust issue arises which should be clarified by the CBN.\n\n\u201cIdeally, NIBSS should not be treated as an agency. There needs to be an independent committee that handles these responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nOn a phone call, a spokesperson for NIBSS said fintechs will find all answers they need for compliance to the BVN system within the new guidelines.\n\nFintech startups like Carbon, Fairmoney and Branch that have licenses that allow them to take user deposits continue to enjoy BVN matching access.\n\nBut the new guidelines might push some fintechs to begin using NIN as a substitute for BVN for their verification purposes. QuickCheck, a digital lending app, now requests NIN from users who want to sign up.\n\nAguele says VerifyMe can be a channel for fintechs without direct access, though the identity technology startup will first have to secure a license from the CBN to provide that service.", "summary": "NIBSS wants to tighten security around Nigeria\u2019s Bank Verification Number (BVN) system.\nThe \u201cApproved Standard Operating Guidelines for BVN Matching System Version 2.0\u201d document is Nigeria\u2019s BVN operations manual.\nBVNs \u2013 unique identification numbers for bank customers \u2013 were launched in 2014 by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Bankers\u2019 Committee as a \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d (KYC) infrastructure for the financial sector.\nAccess to the BVN databaseBanks and fintechs access the BVN database through Application Programming Interface (API) calls.\nThe CBN approves groups who can access BVN information, while NIBSS manages the security of the APIs.", "link": "https://techcabal.com/2021/04/27/can-nibss-save-bvn-from-bank-scams-and-be-a-fair-umpire/", "published": "04/27/2021", "run": "04/27/2021", "keywords": ["bank", "save", "scams", "bvn", "access", "fair", "nibss", "umpire", "fintechs", "customers", "number", "nigerias", "data", "banks"]}
