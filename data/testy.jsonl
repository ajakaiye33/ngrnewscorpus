{"title": "FG Moves to Curb Small Arms Influx, Establishes Control Centre", "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State. This influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat; our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the government had taken steps to ensure that the threat did not turn into an attack, adding that \u201cprofiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs, will be done in order to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nThe SSG assured the people that the state government would ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies would be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\nHe added that the people were not camped in a particular area but moving around the four LGAs and were harboured by residents of the communities, saying that security agencies would fish them out.\n\nThe government also said that five of the bandits who reportedly destroyed the MTN mast in Gamawa LGA in their bid to facilitate their nefarious activities had been arrested.\n\n\u201cSome bandits have been arrested for vandalising the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for an attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Security Council Reconvenes Today\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe council, which had met last Friday, could not conclude deliberations on the security position of the nation and had to adjourn till today to come with a holistic position on the security crisis.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting will hold at the Conference Hall of the First Lady by 10 am with Buhari presiding as usual.\n\nThose expected to attend the meeting include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\n\nOthers are: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Ishiaka Oladayo Amoo and the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n", "summary": "It established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\nThere was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before.\nThe counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy.\nNational Security Council Reconvenes TodayThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.", "link": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/05/04/fg-moves-to-curb-small-arms-influx-establishes-control-centre/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["state", "influx", "weapons", "fg", "curb", "national", "strategy", "small", "security", "light", "centre", "moves", "establishes", "borders", "control", "arms"]}

{"title": "Designing and building sustainable commercial spaces in Nigeria", "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of how products and companies are built in Africa. A new Centre Stage story drops every Monday at 3 PM.\n\nAs workplaces continue to re-open, many organizations are adopting the hybrid work model \u2013 a new working style that combines work remotely and from the office.\n\nThe hybrid work model is perfect for most businesses, especially those with heavy dependence on their operations and customer service teams.\n\nKobo360 is an example of a company with a robust operational and customer service team. The logistics startup helps cargo owners request and schedule trucks to pick up and deliver their goods to specified destinations.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to manage a call centre via Zoom and Meet. Kobo360 needed a new office that was uniquely designed to fit their business operations needs.\n\nTheir office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts. Innovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nYinka meets Kobo360\u2019s co-founders\n\nSo, what goes into planning and setting up a meeting with the founders of a YC-backed startup?\n\nThe first time I met with them was at the end of 2019. During our first meeting, we discussed what they needed in the space and what they were looking for in terms of design and style. And meeting them was a really great experience. Sometimes because of the scale of projects we work on, a lot of our clientele are usually older people. So it was really exciting to work with younger people. They are really brilliant guys.\n\nWas designing the office just a job for you?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. I enjoyed working with them. They understood everything I was saying and we were on the same wavelength. They encouraged and allowed us to be as creative as possible. It was like a match made in heaven for me.\u201d\n\nDealing with tight deadlines and the 2020 pandemic:\n\nWhen you met them, had the company been accepted into YC?\n\n\u201cYes, they had. I first met them at the tail-end of 2018 and the following year, we pretty much came to an agreement about the work that needed to be done, amongst other things.\u201d\n\nDid you know? When Obi Ozor was asked what was getting in the way of Kobo360 becoming a unicorn (a company valued at $1bn or more), Ozor responded with, \u201cWorking capital.\u201d\n\nWhen did work officially start at the site?\n\n[laughs] They gave my team and I a really tight deadline so work pretty much began about two months after I met them. We had a month to design a concept, negotiate and all that; after the ink dried they wanted us on the job ASAP.\n\nWow. That was a really close first start. When was the project completed?\n\nIt was in different phases actually \u2013 the first phase was completed in the middle of 2020 and the second at the end of 2020.\n\nHow did the pandemic affect the work you did for kobo360?\n\nThe pandemic impacted our work in major ways. First, it affected the way we phased and spread out the work. Usually, when we carry out commercial projects, we like to work in four or five phases. It also affected our on-site procedures. We had to regulate working hours and the number of bodies we needed at the site. Proper planning and scheduling became even more important to accomplish our project goals.\n\nKobo360\u2019s office design process\n\nCan you say more about the decision to work in phases and what that looked like for the kobo360 project?\n\nOkay, the first phase I think was the operations floor, and then the call centre. We phase our projects out for several reasons. One reason is financial. We try to ease our client\u2019s financial burdens in terms of commitments. We also consider Kobo360\u2019s operational team. They needed a space to transition into after the lockdown eased in Nigeria. Like I said, we had a really really tight deadline. We pretty much wrapped up the first phase in about a month or two. Wrapping up the first phase quickly allowed us to complete the other portions of the project in good time.\n\nYou mentioned that the founders cared about creativity. Can you tell me about how you accessed the creative side of your mind to specifically do this project.\n\nWe usually try to make all our projects as tailored to the client as much as possible. And we kept that same energy with Kobo360. They are a logistics company which means they pretty much empower freight trucks across Africa.\n\nKeeping their mission in mind, we visualized the expressways and highways freight trucks drive on and utilized them as inspiration for the design of the spine that connects the different functional spaces on the floor. Elements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\n\nWe wanted the space to be a physical representation of what the company actually does in the ecosystem.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nHow did you and your team visualize what Kobo360\u2019s office would look like?\n\nIt was an iterative process. We watched a few videos about Kobo360 as our own way of trying to get inside the soul of the company. Our research into the company, outside of my conversations with the co-founders, informed our design process. Once we finally got to a place that we were comfortable with, we created 3D renderings and video walkthroughs and presented them to Kobo3060. There were a few back and forth feedback sessions \u2013 which are to be expected \u2013 but we wanted to satisfy our clients.\n\nSource: Innovate Concepts LTD.\n\nTell me something about design that most people don\u2019t know?\n\nDesign must be organic.\n\nOrganic? Say more\u2026\n\nSo, I remember being in school and whenever I heard constructive criticism about my design I got upset because I wanted to have my own way. But later I realised that to be a successful architect, you have to be willing to get other people\u2019s perspectives. So design being organic means it being able to bend and make room for stakeholders in the process.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Kobo360\u2019s office. What areas in the space required special attention?\n\nThe part of the building that houses Kobo360\u2019s call centre required special attention. You know there\u2019s a lot of conversation and noise that happens in call centres. So in designing that space, we made it secluded from the general floor and also used a lot of sound-absorbing materials\u2013 like acoustic ceilings. Sound absorbent materials reduce noise and make an office a more conducive environment for employees to function in.\n\nInterior shoot of Kobo360 Office at Costain Lagos.\n\nSustainability, Nigeria\u2019s architectural industry and Yinka\u2019s early years\n\nHow should Nigeria approach innovation in your industry?\n\nIn Nigeria we typically don\u2019t pay attention to being sustainable and eco-friendly. We prioritize costs and getting the work done quickly. Getting work done quickly is good, but Nigerian architects need to start designing with sustainability in mind. When we scope a building, we construct pathways for natural ventilation and daylight. We also prioritize using local materials over processed ones. This way of thinking seems expensive but in the long term, you actually save more money on energy.\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nWith Kobo360, we used a lot of daylighting in the space. So again, during the day they hardly actually put on any of the artificial lights because there\u2019s a lot of natural light coming in through the large windows placed around the office.\n\nWhy architecture? What inspired you to go down this path?\n\nWhy did I want to study architecture? it\u2019s just something that you know has always been a passion. Funny enough, I was actually inspired by my father. He\u2019s also an architect, so I guess that\u2019s who planted the seed. But yeah I mean I tried it in university and loved it and I\u2019ve never looked back. Architecture is what I have always wanted to do.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria. Yinka moved back home to make a difference in the architectural industry; and he\u2019s doing so by guiding Innovate Concepts, into the future of eco-friendly and culturally relevant design.", "summary": "Their office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts.\nInnovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\nLike I said, we had a really really tight deadline.\nElements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria.", "link": "https://techcabal.com/2021/05/03/designing-and-building-sustainable-commercial-spaces-in-nigeria/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["kobo360", "wanted", "design", "way", "designing", "commercial", "spaces", "really", "company", "building", "centre", "space", "nigeria", "office", "sustainable", "work"]}

{"title": "ANALYSIS: New Policy Fails To Reverse Gas Flaring, Importation", "text": "May 3, 2021 437\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.", "summary": "May 3, 2021 437To reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent.", "link": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/analysis-new-policy-fails-to-reverse-gas-flaring-importation/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["nigerian", "importation", "oil", "cooking", "reverse", "flaring", "analysis", "petroleum", "fails", "nigeria", "target", "gas", "policy", "2020", "country"]}

These bacteria groups play a critical role in the development and maturation of a vast ecosystem of gut microbes, known as the microbiota, which is a powerful player in health and disease.\n\n\u201cThis work shows that the development of a healthy immune system and microbiota may actually start well before a child is born \u2014 and signals that the tiny molecules an infant is exposed to in the womb play a fundamental role in future health,\u201d says Dr. Petersen.\n\nUsing a machine-learning algorithm, the researchers combined meconium, microbe and clinical data to predict with a high degree of accuracy (76 per cent), and more reliably than ever before, whether or not an infant would develop allergies by one year of age.\n\nThe study findings have important implications for at-risk infants, say the researchers.\n\n\u201cWe know that children with allergies are at the highest risk of also developing asthma. Now, we have an opportunity to identify at-risk infants who could benefit from early interventions before they even begin to show signs and symptoms of allergies or asthma later in life,\u201d says the study\u2019s senior co-author Dr. Stuart Turvey, a professor in UBC\u2019s department of paediatrics.", "summary": "Cell Reports Medicine is a cutting-edge open access research in translational and clinical biomedical sciences that inform and influence human health and medicine.\n\u201cMeconium is like a time capsule, revealing what the infant was exposed to before it was born.\nAs part of the study, the researchers analysed meconium samples from 100 infants enrolled in the CHILD Cohort Study, a world-leading birth cohort study in maternal, newborn and child health research.\nThey discovered that the fewer different types of molecules a baby\u2019s meconium contained, the greater the child\u2019s risk of developing allergies by one year.\n\u201cWe know that children with allergies are at the highest risk of also developing asthma.", "link": "https://healthwise.punchng.com/babys-first-stool-can-help-predict-risk-of-developing-allergies-says-study/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["babys", "study", "child", "help", "researchers", "health", "dr", "stool", "life", "later", "developing", "molecules", "asthma", "meconium", "risk", "allergies", "predict"]}

{"title": "FG Moves to Curb Small Arms Influx, Establishes Control Centre", "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State. This influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat; our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the government had taken steps to ensure that the threat did not turn into an attack, adding that \u201cprofiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs, will be done in order to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nThe SSG assured the people that the state government would ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies would be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\nHe added that the people were not camped in a particular area but moving around the four LGAs and were harboured by residents of the communities, saying that security agencies would fish them out.\n\nThe government also said that five of the bandits who reportedly destroyed the MTN mast in Gamawa LGA in their bid to facilitate their nefarious activities had been arrested.\n\n\u201cSome bandits have been arrested for vandalising the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for an attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Security Council Reconvenes Today\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe council, which had met last Friday, could not conclude deliberations on the security position of the nation and had to adjourn till today to come with a holistic position on the security crisis.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting will hold at the Conference Hall of the First Lady by 10 am with Buhari presiding as usual.\n\nThose expected to attend the meeting include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\n\nOthers are: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Ishiaka Oladayo Amoo and the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n", "summary": "It established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\nThere was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before.\nThe counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy.\nNational Security Council Reconvenes TodayThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.", "link": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/05/04/fg-moves-to-curb-small-arms-influx-establishes-control-centre/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["control", "moves", "centre", "influx", "light", "national", "small", "curb", "weapons", "fg", "arms", "strategy", "borders", "security", "state", "establishes"]}

He was a bus driver, and with the help of another kind lady who was around, they helped carry us to the hospital.\n\nWe were unsuccessful with getting treatment at two hospitals, before finally ending up at Ikorodu General Hospital.

The staff of Ikorodu Hospital had begun first aid treatment on us by the time the driver returned with the report.\n\nWe were later referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), but just when we were about to set off, more problems arose: Our good samaritan found out that his bus had run out of fuel. We decided to go back to the Area Command so they could help us with a vehicle to transport us to LUTH.\n\nWhen we got to the Area Command, we met some top police officials who had just arrived there. They told us that they were coming from the Isheri Police Station, where the officers who had attacked us earlier were based. The police chiefs assured us that the officers had been arrested, and that the matter would be handled with the justice it deserved.\n\nThey then released a vehicle to convey us to LUTH.

Fortunately, and finally, he was able to obtain one. The staff of Ikorodu Hospital had begun first aid treatment on us by the time the driver returned with the report.\n\nWe were later referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), but just when we were about to set off, more problems arose: Our good samaritan found out that his bus had run out of fuel. We decided to go back to the Area Command so they could help us with a vehicle to transport us to LUTH.\n\nWhen we got to the Area Command, we met some top police officials who had just arrived there. They told us that they were coming from the Isheri Police Station, where the officers who had attacked us earlier were based. The police chiefs assured us that the officers had been arrested, and that the matter would be handled with the justice it deserved.\n\nThey then released a vehicle to convey us to LUTH. With the help of the officers, and CSO there, we were given urgent attention, with the police paying the bills our treatment.\n\nWhile my jaw and right hand sustained damage that still gives me issues today, my wife however couldn't live to tell her story.\n\nI really wish she had sustained only injuries like I had, but it wasn to be. This innocent, loving woman was a mother to my children and I, and now she is no more - for reasons no one can still explain.\n\nLosing the wife of my youth has been akin to losing my very life. I feel lost. I am not okay. I am in pain, physically and emotionally, and my children are out of school too.\n\nMy life has been turned upside down, and I have barely had help coming through for me. I am calling on all Nigerians, especially our President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, to come to my aid.\n\nI pray people have compassion on my family, at least for the sake of my children, because I do not want this cruel tragedy to rob them of a good education.

{"title": "Designing and building sustainable commercial spaces in Nigeria", "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of how products and companies are built in Africa. A new Centre Stage story drops every Monday at 3 PM.\n\nAs workplaces continue to re-open, many organizations are adopting the hybrid work model \u2013 a new working style that combines work remotely and from the office.\n\nThe hybrid work model is perfect for most businesses, especially those with heavy dependence on their operations and customer service teams.\n\nKobo360 is an example of a company with a robust operational and customer service team. The logistics startup helps cargo owners request and schedule trucks to pick up and deliver their goods to specified destinations.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to manage a call centre via Zoom and Meet. Kobo360 needed a new office that was uniquely designed to fit their business operations needs.\n\nTheir office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts. Innovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nYinka meets Kobo360\u2019s co-founders\n\nSo, what goes into planning and setting up a meeting with the founders of a YC-backed startup?\n\nThe first time I met with them was at the end of 2019. During our first meeting, we discussed what they needed in the space and what they were looking for in terms of design and style. And meeting them was a really great experience. Sometimes because of the scale of projects we work on, a lot of our clientele are usually older people. So it was really exciting to work with younger people. They are really brilliant guys.\n\nWas designing the office just a job for you?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. I enjoyed working with them. They understood everything I was saying and we were on the same wavelength. They encouraged and allowed us to be as creative as possible. It was like a match made in heaven for me.\u201d\n\nDealing with tight deadlines and the 2020 pandemic:\n\nWhen you met them, had the company been accepted into YC?\n\n\u201cYes, they had. I first met them at the tail-end of 2018 and the following year, we pretty much came to an agreement about the work that needed to be done, amongst other things.\u201d\n\nDid you know? When Obi Ozor was asked what was getting in the way of Kobo360 becoming a unicorn (a company valued at $1bn or more), Ozor responded with, \u201cWorking capital.\u201d\n\nWhen did work officially start at the site?\n\n[laughs] They gave my team and I a really tight deadline so work pretty much began about two months after I met them. We had a month to design a concept, negotiate and all that; after the ink dried they wanted us on the job ASAP.\n\nWow. That was a really close first start. When was the project completed?\n\nIt was in different phases actually \u2013 the first phase was completed in the middle of 2020 and the second at the end of 2020.\n\nHow did the pandemic affect the work you did for kobo360?\n\nThe pandemic impacted our work in major ways. First, it affected the way we phased and spread out the work. Usually, when we carry out commercial projects, we like to work in four or five phases. It also affected our on-site procedures. We had to regulate working hours and the number of bodies we needed at the site. Proper planning and scheduling became even more important to accomplish our project goals.\n\nKobo360\u2019s office design process\n\nCan you say more about the decision to work in phases and what that looked like for the kobo360 project?\n\nOkay, the first phase I think was the operations floor, and then the call centre. We phase our projects out for several reasons. One reason is financial. We try to ease our client\u2019s financial burdens in terms of commitments. We also consider Kobo360\u2019s operational team. They needed a space to transition into after the lockdown eased in Nigeria. Like I said, we had a really really tight deadline. We pretty much wrapped up the first phase in about a month or two. Wrapping up the first phase quickly allowed us to complete the other portions of the project in good time.\n\nYou mentioned that the founders cared about creativity. Can you tell me about how you accessed the creative side of your mind to specifically do this project.\n\nWe usually try to make all our projects as tailored to the client as much as possible. And we kept that same energy with Kobo360. They are a logistics company which means they pretty much empower freight trucks across Africa.\n\nKeeping their mission in mind, we visualized the expressways and highways freight trucks drive on and utilized them as inspiration for the design of the spine that connects the different functional spaces on the floor. Elements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\n\nWe wanted the space to be a physical representation of what the company actually does in the ecosystem.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nHow did you and your team visualize what Kobo360\u2019s office would look like?\n\nIt was an iterative process. We watched a few videos about Kobo360 as our own way of trying to get inside the soul of the company. Our research into the company, outside of my conversations with the co-founders, informed our design process. Once we finally got to a place that we were comfortable with, we created 3D renderings and video walkthroughs and presented them to Kobo3060. There were a few back and forth feedback sessions \u2013 which are to be expected \u2013 but we wanted to satisfy our clients.\n\nSource: Innovate Concepts LTD.\n\nTell me something about design that most people don\u2019t know?\n\nDesign must be organic.\n\nOrganic? Say more\u2026\n\nSo, I remember being in school and whenever I heard constructive criticism about my design I got upset because I wanted to have my own way. But later I realised that to be a successful architect, you have to be willing to get other people\u2019s perspectives. So design being organic means it being able to bend and make room for stakeholders in the process.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Kobo360\u2019s office. What areas in the space required special attention?\n\nThe part of the building that houses Kobo360\u2019s call centre required special attention. You know there\u2019s a lot of conversation and noise that happens in call centres. So in designing that space, we made it secluded from the general floor and also used a lot of sound-absorbing materials\u2013 like acoustic ceilings. Sound absorbent materials reduce noise and make an office a more conducive environment for employees to function in.\n\nInterior shoot of Kobo360 Office at Costain Lagos.\n\nSustainability, Nigeria\u2019s architectural industry and Yinka\u2019s early years\n\nHow should Nigeria approach innovation in your industry?\n\nIn Nigeria we typically don\u2019t pay attention to being sustainable and eco-friendly. We prioritize costs and getting the work done quickly. Getting work done quickly is good, but Nigerian architects need to start designing with sustainability in mind. When we scope a building, we construct pathways for natural ventilation and daylight. We also prioritize using local materials over processed ones. This way of thinking seems expensive but in the long term, you actually save more money on energy.\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nWith Kobo360, we used a lot of daylighting in the space. So again, during the day they hardly actually put on any of the artificial lights because there\u2019s a lot of natural light coming in through the large windows placed around the office.\n\nWhy architecture? What inspired you to go down this path?\n\nWhy did I want to study architecture? it\u2019s just something that you know has always been a passion. Funny enough, I was actually inspired by my father. He\u2019s also an architect, so I guess that\u2019s who planted the seed. But yeah I mean I tried it in university and loved it and I\u2019ve never looked back. Architecture is what I have always wanted to do.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria.

{"title": "ANALYSIS: New Policy Fails To Reverse Gas Flaring, Importation", "text": "May 3, 2021 439\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.", "summary": "May 3, 2021 439To reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent.", "link": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/analysis-new-policy-fails-to-reverse-gas-flaring-importation/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["importation", "petroleum", "flaring", "policy", "2020", "gas", "nigeria", "analysis", "target", "fails", "country", "reverse", "oil", "nigerian", "cooking"]}

{"title": "Boko Haram infiltrates Bauchi councils, Borno communities", "text": "By David Adenuga, Bauchi and Duku Joel, Damaturu\n\nSuspected Boko Haram members on Monday intensified their onslaught on many towns and villages in the Northern part of the country.\n\nIn Bauchi State, government raised the alarm over the infiltration of terrorists into four local governments.\n\nThe affected councils are Gamawa, where the terrorists vandalised a telecommunication mast belonging to the MTN in Gamawa Local Government Area. The other affected areas are Zaki, Dambam and Darazo.\n\nIn Yobe State, no fewer than 10,000 people were displaced during an attack on Geidam, which had been previously ravaged by terrorism.\n\nHowever, in Borno State, troops thwarted the attempts by the sect to infiltrate into Rann, in Kala Balge Local Government Area.\n\nThe Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Yerima, said: \u201cOperation Hadin Kai, successfully repelled the insurgents after a fierce fire fight that lasted for almost one hour.\n\nAccording to Bauchi State government, the influx of people from neighbouring Yobe State has made the affected local government areas vulnerable to attacks by the terrorists.\n\nAddressing reporters at the Government House, Bauchi, shortly after an emergency security meeting presided over by Governor Bala Mohammed, Secretary to the Government, Alhaji Sabiu Baba, said five people have been arrested in connection with the mast vandalism.\n\nHe said the suspected terrorists had the intention of blocking communication, in preparation for the attacks.\n\nBaba, however, assured that the state government is working round the clock to beef up security surveillance around neighbouring communities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat. Our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development. We have decided to commence profiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nBaba added: \u201cThe state government will ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies will be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\n\u201cAs for those that are displaced persons, government officials will identify them in order to provide relief materials for their well-being because according to him, government will not just watch them suffer.\u201d\n\nThe SSG said Governor Mohammed has provided support to security agencies to intensify patrol and surveillance, particularly in the vulnerable border communities, which share border with Yobe.\n\nOver 10,000 displaced from Geidam attack\n\nThe Executive Secretary of Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (YOSEMA), Dr. Mohammed Goje, lamented that over 10,000 people have been displaced during the attack on Geidam.\n\nGoje said the attack had unleashed humanitarian crisis, adding that it is not advisable to quickly return to Geidam due to security reasons.\n\nGoje also disclosed that there is a large influx of displaced people into Damaturu, the state capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe cooperation of the host community has been encouraging. SEMA has decided to give a lot of support to the households to reduce the burden of the IDPs on them\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe number of displaced people from Geidam keeps increasing. At the moment, we are approaching like 10, 000, based on the ones that we have registered. This is an emergency situation that comes at a time that you least expect. Our contingency plan, for now, is just 10 per cent, which is quite insignificant.\n\n\u201cHowever, we have been reaching out to people for the provision of food and non-food items, especially the provision of portable water to the people to drink at their transist location\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere were rumours that some displaced people want to go back because they have heard that normalcy had returned. But, we have not been communicated officially. So, we cannot take the risk of returning anybody back to Geidam.\n\n\u201cWhat we are encouraging people is to be integrated in the host communities through relatives. We have been going round mobilising food items and shelter kits to the households that are hosting them so that they would not overstretch the available facilities.\n\n\u201cCurrently, our trucks to Mazagum, Bayamari, Yusufari and Yunusari with food items have been mobilised. For Damaturu, we have reached about 1000 individuals as at Wednesday night. Our target is five days within which we will stabilise the situation and see if people could return.\u201d\n\nGoje said the agency had already met with about 65 humanitarian partners that are ready to assist in the Geidam crisis.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cIf there is an attack in a community and the people are displaced and are also in need of assistance, then, of course, there is a humanitarian crisis. But, the most importantly is how to respond to the crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have started mobilising with some humanitarian partners on how to deal with the situation. Already, I have had meetings with about 65 of them, who had indicated interest to fill the gaps. The other aspect we are hoping for is the improvement of the security situation. We hope that the security situation improves so that people can return to their communities because it is easier to take care of people in their communities than outside their communities\u201d.\n\nTroops thwart attempted infiltration of Borno towns by terrorists\n\nThe Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Yerima said terrorists who attempted to attack Kala were resisted.\n\nHe said the terrorists withdrew in disarray, adding that many of them suffered fatal injuries, leaving behind their weapons and ammunition.\n\nAccording to him, equipment recovered from the terrorists included anti-aircraft gun barrel, AK 47 rifle, hand-held communication radio and other ammunition.\n\nThe Army spokesperson disclosed that troops also engaged another band of terrorists, who attacked Ajiri town in Konduga council.\n\nHe said the terrorists burnt nine houses and killed innocent residents before they were engaged by the troops.\n\nYerima said, the retreating terrorists escaped with various degrees of injuries while the gallant troops were on their chase.\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, two personnel paid the supreme price in the resulting encounter.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Lt.-Gen.

{"title": "FG Moves to Curb Small Arms Influx, Establishes Control Centre", "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State. This influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat; our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the government had taken steps to ensure that the threat did not turn into an attack, adding that \u201cprofiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs, will be done in order to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nThe SSG assured the people that the state government would ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies would be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\nHe added that the people were not camped in a particular area but moving around the four LGAs and were harboured by residents of the communities, saying that security agencies would fish them out.\n\nThe government also said that five of the bandits who reportedly destroyed the MTN mast in Gamawa LGA in their bid to facilitate their nefarious activities had been arrested.\n\n\u201cSome bandits have been arrested for vandalising the MTN installation in Gamawa LGA with the intention of blocking communication in the area in preparation for an attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nNational Security Council Reconvenes Today\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe council, which had met last Friday, could not conclude deliberations on the security position of the nation and had to adjourn till today to come with a holistic position on the security crisis.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting will hold at the Conference Hall of the First Lady by 10 am with Buhari presiding as usual.\n\nThose expected to attend the meeting include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha; the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd).\n\nOthers are: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant-General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu; Chief of Air Staff; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Ishiaka Oladayo Amoo and the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n", "summary": "It established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\nThere was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before.\nThe counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy.\nNational Security Council Reconvenes TodayThe National Security Council (NSC) headed by President Muhammadu Buhari will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.", "link": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/05/04/fg-moves-to-curb-small-arms-influx-establishes-control-centre/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["borders", "establishes", "national", "small", "fg", "control", "influx", "centre", "security", "state", "light", "curb", "arms", "strategy", "weapons", "moves"]}

{"title": "MTN Nigeria\u2019s Q1 2021 results show it may be quietly poised for fintech leadership", "text": "Nigeria\u2019s leading telecoms provider, MTN Nigeria, has released its financial report for the first quarter of 2021, showing strong performance despite losing 5 million customers.\n\nA recent policy by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) suspended the registration of new SIM cards. This suspension meant that as telecoms operators like MTN lost subscribers through churn, they could not add new customers. Active data users also declined marginally by 71,000 to 32.5 million.\n\nDespite the decline, MTN still showed strong performance in Q1 as Profit before tax grew by 33.9% to N102.9 billion. Karl Toriola, the company\u2019s CEO, summarised the performance perfectly, \u201cWe made good progress in the first quarter of 2021 despite the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nOne big sign of progress for the company is the increase in the data, digital, and fintech revenue even as voice revenue growth remains tepid.\n\nData brings in even more revenue.\n\nAs voice revenue continues to slow down, data revenue is thought to be the future for telecoms companies, and by MTN\u2019s Q1 results, that future looks bright. Data revenue brought in around 36.4% of total revenue.\n\nData contributes massively because of a corresponding increase in how people are using data. MTN recorded an 86.7% increase in data traffic and a 48.5% increase in usage (MB per user) from the existing base.\n\nMTN has expanded its 4G coverage to about 61.8% of the population but what\u2019s more interesting is that in Q1, it added 1.2 million smartphones to its network. 47.5% of the company\u2019s customers now use smartphones.\n\nIt is easy to see why analysts say that data revenue is the future when you consider that less than 47.5% of its customer base contributes over 35% to its total revenue. When smartphone penetration moves to the region of 70%, data revenue could grow even more significant.\n\nBut data revenue isn\u2019t the only thing that is growing, with MTN showing real promise in its fintech efforts.\n\nIs MTN Nigeria posed for fintech leadership?\n\nIn August 2019, MTN launched its mobile money business, MoMo, in Nigeria. Its competitors are companies like OPay and Paga, both of which have talked up some impressive figures at different times.\n\nOPay has claimed to have over 300,000 agents and said that in December 2020, it processed $2 billion in payments. In comparison, MoMo\u2019s progress has been overlooked by observers and analysts.\n\nIn Q1, the number of MoMo agents increased by 54,000 to 449,146.

{"title": "Designing and building sustainable commercial spaces in Nigeria", "text": "It takes a great team to build an equally great product. Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of how products and companies are built in Africa. A new Centre Stage story drops every Monday at 3 PM.\n\nAs workplaces continue to re-open, many organizations are adopting the hybrid work model \u2013 a new working style that combines work remotely and from the office.\n\nThe hybrid work model is perfect for most businesses, especially those with heavy dependence on their operations and customer service teams.\n\nKobo360 is an example of a company with a robust operational and customer service team. The logistics startup helps cargo owners request and schedule trucks to pick up and deliver their goods to specified destinations.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to manage a call centre via Zoom and Meet. Kobo360 needed a new office that was uniquely designed to fit their business operations needs.\n\nTheir office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts. Innovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nYinka meets Kobo360\u2019s co-founders\n\nSo, what goes into planning and setting up a meeting with the founders of a YC-backed startup?\n\nThe first time I met with them was at the end of 2019. During our first meeting, we discussed what they needed in the space and what they were looking for in terms of design and style. And meeting them was a really great experience. Sometimes because of the scale of projects we work on, a lot of our clientele are usually older people. So it was really exciting to work with younger people. They are really brilliant guys.\n\nWas designing the office just a job for you?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. I enjoyed working with them. They understood everything I was saying and we were on the same wavelength. They encouraged and allowed us to be as creative as possible. It was like a match made in heaven for me.\u201d\n\nDealing with tight deadlines and the 2020 pandemic:\n\nWhen you met them, had the company been accepted into YC?\n\n\u201cYes, they had. I first met them at the tail-end of 2018 and the following year, we pretty much came to an agreement about the work that needed to be done, amongst other things.\u201d\n\nDid you know? When Obi Ozor was asked what was getting in the way of Kobo360 becoming a unicorn (a company valued at $1bn or more), Ozor responded with, \u201cWorking capital.\u201d\n\nWhen did work officially start at the site?\n\n[laughs] They gave my team and I a really tight deadline so work pretty much began about two months after I met them. We had a month to design a concept, negotiate and all that; after the ink dried they wanted us on the job ASAP.\n\nWow. That was a really close first start. When was the project completed?\n\nIt was in different phases actually \u2013 the first phase was completed in the middle of 2020 and the second at the end of 2020.\n\nHow did the pandemic affect the work you did for kobo360?\n\nThe pandemic impacted our work in major ways. First, it affected the way we phased and spread out the work. Usually, when we carry out commercial projects, we like to work in four or five phases. It also affected our on-site procedures. We had to regulate working hours and the number of bodies we needed at the site. Proper planning and scheduling became even more important to accomplish our project goals.\n\nKobo360\u2019s office design process\n\nCan you say more about the decision to work in phases and what that looked like for the kobo360 project?\n\nOkay, the first phase I think was the operations floor, and then the call centre. We phase our projects out for several reasons. One reason is financial. We try to ease our client\u2019s financial burdens in terms of commitments. We also consider Kobo360\u2019s operational team. They needed a space to transition into after the lockdown eased in Nigeria. Like I said, we had a really really tight deadline. We pretty much wrapped up the first phase in about a month or two. Wrapping up the first phase quickly allowed us to complete the other portions of the project in good time.\n\nYou mentioned that the founders cared about creativity. Can you tell me about how you accessed the creative side of your mind to specifically do this project.\n\nWe usually try to make all our projects as tailored to the client as much as possible. And we kept that same energy with Kobo360. They are a logistics company which means they pretty much empower freight trucks across Africa.\n\nKeeping their mission in mind, we visualized the expressways and highways freight trucks drive on and utilized them as inspiration for the design of the spine that connects the different functional spaces on the floor. Elements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\n\nWe wanted the space to be a physical representation of what the company actually does in the ecosystem.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nHow did you and your team visualize what Kobo360\u2019s office would look like?\n\nIt was an iterative process. We watched a few videos about Kobo360 as our own way of trying to get inside the soul of the company. Our research into the company, outside of my conversations with the co-founders, informed our design process. Once we finally got to a place that we were comfortable with, we created 3D renderings and video walkthroughs and presented them to Kobo3060. There were a few back and forth feedback sessions \u2013 which are to be expected \u2013 but we wanted to satisfy our clients.\n\nSource: Innovate Concepts LTD.\n\nTell me something about design that most people don\u2019t know?\n\nDesign must be organic.\n\nOrganic? Say more\u2026\n\nSo, I remember being in school and whenever I heard constructive criticism about my design I got upset because I wanted to have my own way. But later I realised that to be a successful architect, you have to be willing to get other people\u2019s perspectives. So design being organic means it being able to bend and make room for stakeholders in the process.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Kobo360\u2019s office. What areas in the space required special attention?\n\nThe part of the building that houses Kobo360\u2019s call centre required special attention. You know there\u2019s a lot of conversation and noise that happens in call centres. So in designing that space, we made it secluded from the general floor and also used a lot of sound-absorbing materials\u2013 like acoustic ceilings. Sound absorbent materials reduce noise and make an office a more conducive environment for employees to function in.\n\nInterior shoot of Kobo360 Office at Costain Lagos.\n\nSustainability, Nigeria\u2019s architectural industry and Yinka\u2019s early years\n\nHow should Nigeria approach innovation in your industry?\n\nIn Nigeria we typically don\u2019t pay attention to being sustainable and eco-friendly. We prioritize costs and getting the work done quickly. Getting work done quickly is good, but Nigerian architects need to start designing with sustainability in mind. When we scope a building, we construct pathways for natural ventilation and daylight. We also prioritize using local materials over processed ones. This way of thinking seems expensive but in the long term, you actually save more money on energy.\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nWith Kobo360, we used a lot of daylighting in the space. So again, during the day they hardly actually put on any of the artificial lights because there\u2019s a lot of natural light coming in through the large windows placed around the office.\n\nWhy architecture? What inspired you to go down this path?\n\nWhy did I want to study architecture? it\u2019s just something that you know has always been a passion. Funny enough, I was actually inspired by my father. He\u2019s also an architect, so I guess that\u2019s who planted the seed. But yeah I mean I tried it in university and loved it and I\u2019ve never looked back. Architecture is what I have always wanted to do.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria. Yinka moved back home to make a difference in the architectural industry; and he\u2019s doing so by guiding Innovate Concepts, into the future of eco-friendly and culturally relevant design.", "summary": "Their office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts.\nInnovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\nLike I said, we had a really really tight deadline.\nElements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria.", "link": "https://techcabal.com/2021/05/03/designing-and-building-sustainable-commercial-spaces-in-nigeria/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["designing", "spaces", "office", "wanted", "sustainable", "centre", "design", "space", "kobo360", "company", "commercial", "nigeria", "work", "really", "building", "way"]}

At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.", "summary": "May 3, 2021 440To reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent.", "link": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/analysis-new-policy-fails-to-reverse-gas-flaring-importation/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["nigerian", "reverse", "oil", "flaring", "policy", "target", "analysis", "cooking", "2020", "fails", "country", "nigeria", "petroleum", "importation", "gas"]}

{"title": "Our security strategy is working, we have transformed Aba", "text": "The Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu has opened up on how he is tackling insecurity in Abia State, highlighting in this interview with DAILY POST Editor, Adoyi Abah Ali and Felicity of News Central the strategies his government has employed to tackle the nationwide insecurity.\n\nIkpeazu in this interview reveals how he has transformed the commercial city of Aba from a sleeping to a commercial giant, in an effort towards a total commercialization and industrialization of Abia State (The Kinetic Abia)\n\nExcerpts:\n\nThank you very much for the opportunity and congratulations on your anniversary. I would like to start this conversation from the security situation in the country at the moment. It\u2019s a nationwide challenge but in recent times, there has been a spike in places like Abia and Imo States. What are you doing to help address this?\n\nI want to place it on record that we don\u2019t really have a security situation that\u2019s as bad as what we experience presently in other parts of the country, especially, the frontline states in the northeast, but that is not to say that the insecurity situation in Nigeria is not glaring. Trying to paint the present situation in the Southeast or Abia with the same brush will not be exactly fair. Now having said that, responding directly to your question about my State, Abia is one of the states in the Southeast, and our challenge basically is trying to cope with some people who feel aggrieved over imbalance, those who feel cheated by the federal government. This has led to a few attacks.\n\nBut this challenge has been majorly directed at institutions and law enforcement infrastructures and personnel. Ordinary people, businessmen, and traders are not directly impacted but we want total peace and security as nobody will be happy to do business when bullets are flying all over the place. It doesn\u2019t matter who the target is, so for us here, what we try to do is to first of all make sure that we deploy gatekeepers, deep into our communities, getting pieces of information around movements of persons that are strange and unusual and we have set up a structure that can resolve this quickly.\n\nAgain we give advisory based on the interest we have. We advise our people on what to do and what not to do through public enlightenment. We just came back from a 17 local government tour, which involved traditional leaders, church leaders, youth leaders, hunters, farmers, traders, and everyone across local governments. The discussion is why are we pouncing on ourselves? Why are we doing this? Why are we putting the problems on a more serious scale?\n\nI think that the challenge of our country is still dependent on three things which include injustice, ethnicity and religion. It\u2019s still dependent on these things and I have people that understand the issues better than myself and I think they\u2019ve been doing the needful.\n\nIt still remains a collective thing. If every other Governor does what they are expected to do in their states, this could be addressed on time, what do you think?\n\nYes, but strategically speaking, I think that at the national level, how quick is their response to the issue? I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s good enough.\n\nStill talking on the security issues, there is a curfew from 6pm to 6am. Do you intend to keep this indefinitely? What are your plans? At least, there should be nightlife.\n\nThere has to be life for there to be nightlife and how to move on. We are trying to protect life and property before you can now make a choice on whether to be normal or to do your things in the day, so the curfew is our effort to respond to the challenges that are prevalent here.\n\nThis is indefinite?\n\nIt is not indefinite so to speak, it\u2019s just to say that if there is an improvement, we will take other decisions. This will be based on the feedback we get. If by this evening we get information that we should lift, we\u2019ll lift, but you know that Abia State is at the centre of 7 states, some of the states are in the South-South, some are in the Southeast, so being at the confluence gives us advantage, but in this case, it\u2019s a disadvantage. Whatever happens in some of these states directly or indirectly affects us. So we are looking at everything. Every person in leadership position should naturally prioritize security issues. We should adopt quick and intelligent action. Decisions around security shouldn\u2019t be matters based on what the newspapers are saying or what the internet is saying. I think decisions should be based on what I think we need to do to protect lives and property.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about COVID-19. We went round town today and there is no wearing of face mask, no social distancing. I want to ask you as the man at the helm of affairs, what is the state doing when it comes to COVID-19 prevention measures, vaccination drives and others? Are people even quarantined?\n\nYes, our numbers and statistics are reported daily to NCDC and are published. The citizens of the country are suffering from fatigue, that is one. Two, there are laws that govern the system, some of them are natural and universal. When you are pressed economically and I think I had the privilege of speaking on this when I attended a World Bank meeting in Washington DC and the conversation we had was around environmentally friendly ways of production, reducing the carbon dioxide and making sure the ozone layer is protected, and I said to them that in Africa, we are predominantly hungry. We are looking for a way to even produce what we eat, so our emphasis is not how to do it a better way, it\u2019s just how to do it. So people are pressed on all sides today, the economy is bad amid insecurity. So because they have to survive, the COVID-19 project has become secondary. Whether it is right or wrong is a matter for discussion, but when you are talking to somebody, you have to be careful about how the person responds, so that it will not be a case of taking a horse to the river and the horse refuses to drink.\n\nBut in your capacity as the Governor and seeing what is happening, is there something that you are doing to encourage Abia people to respect some of these protocols put in place, what about Vaccination for Abians?\n\nCertainly, we are doing everything to sensitize and ask state-based leaders and Abia boys to do the advocacy for us, but I say to you that the people are concerned about what to eat. They have gone up to begin to think on how to be safe and put food on the table, that wouldn\u2019t stop government from doing what government wants to do. But I have to bring to the fore that success or otherwise in this battle against COVID-19 depends actually on the ability of the citizens to take responsibility for their safety. You don\u2019t tell an adult to go away from the sun, we thought it will get to a point where people will have to take heed to the protocols because of their health and their loved ones.\n\nFor the vaccine, as a subnational government, we are dependent on how much of the vaccine that were brought to Abia State and for our people. I was happy today that when I went to church, it was advertised and they went into details of which category of people should first be vaccinated, starting from the medical and frontline officers, enforcement officers, those who are constantly interfacing with others and those within a certain age bracket.\n\nYour administration has three years more. Are you satisfied so far with the target you set for yourself in infrastructure, especially regarding roads?\n\nI\u2019m not sad about where we are, but I think we just need to keep the tempo going. Between 2015 and now, I have been trying to redefine governance. First, no two states are the same. The problems that confront our states vary and the strategies to tackle same vary. So it\u2019s my expectation that any government at inception must be able to construct a pathway that can lead to the strategy that can be adopted under the circumstance. That was why, here in 2015, we set a target for ourselves on five pillars \u2013 trade and commerce, Small and Medium Scale enterprises, Agriculture and education. And trying to push these pillars, we needed to develop what I would call enablers. What are those things that would enable these pillars? The fact today that you were moving around Aba and got stuck in the traffic shows that something is happening. It shows that life has returned to this place. It shows that businesses have returned. That you can see Dominos, Chicken Republic and others shows we are back on track. If you had come here before now, you would have had a clearer picture of what it was back then. The fact that Golden Guinea has come back to life, the fact that we have set up a shoes factory, the fact that we are almost at the verge of setting up a garment factory, it means that we are specific and intentional about doing something in the garment and leather sub-sectors. We have enabled trade and commerce one way or the other. That Abia last month or two months ago came third in foreign direct investment means that we have done something.\n\nThe problem we have always had as a country is the issue of continuity and sustainability. Are you looking at this since you have just a few years in office? Does this not worry you?\n\nMost of the roads you saw today are rigid-based roads. What you see is the asphalt overlay but beneath it is cement. Those roads can stay for 40 years. But we did not stop at that. We have set up what we call Youth Road Maintenance Corps. As I speak, some of the youths are undergoing training. From now on, road maintenance will be in the hands of the youths local government by local government. The agenda is nothing but to run operation zero portholes. This is one example of some of the institutions we are trying to set up. We also have Abia Road Infrastructural Maintenance Agency. Before I came in, there was no street light here, but today we have over 2000 street lights in Aba. You will also notice the planted grasses at the middle of the road. That was not the case before now. There is an agency manned by our youths that will maintain these things. So we are gradually setting up structures that can follow up with the maintenance of all Abia projects.\n\nTo Be CONTINUED\u2026", "summary": "The Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu has opened up on how he is tackling insecurity in Abia State, highlighting in this interview with DAILY POST Editor, Adoyi Abah Ali and Felicity of News Central the strategies his government has employed to tackle the nationwide insecurity.\nI want to ask you as the man at the helm of affairs, what is the state doing when it comes to COVID-19 prevention measures, vaccination drives and others?\nFor the vaccine, as a subnational government, we are dependent on how much of the vaccine that were brought to Abia State and for our people.\nThe fact today that you were moving around Aba and got stuck in the traffic shows that something is happening.\nBefore I came in, there was no street light here, but today we have over 2000 street lights in Aba.", "link": "https://dailypost.ng/2021/05/04/our-security-strategy-is-working-we-have-transformed-aba-abia-gov-ikpeazu-interview/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["trying", "doing", "things", "state", "transformed", "abia", "set", "think", "aba", "working", "security", "strategy", "today", "states"]}
{"title": "Boko Haram infiltrates Bauchi councils, Borno communities", "text": "By David Adenuga, Bauchi and Duku Joel, Damaturu\n\nSuspected Boko Haram members on Monday intensified their onslaught on many towns and villages in the Northern part of the country.\n\nIn Bauchi State, government raised the alarm over the infiltration of terrorists into four local governments.\n\nThe affected councils are Gamawa, where the terrorists vandalised a telecommunication mast belonging to the MTN in Gamawa Local Government Area. The other affected areas are Zaki, Dambam and Darazo.\n\nIn Yobe State, no fewer than 10,000 people were displaced during an attack on Geidam, which had been previously ravaged by terrorism.\n\nHowever, in Borno State, troops thwarted the attempts by the sect to infiltrate into Rann, in Kala Balge Local Government Area.\n\nThe Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Yerima, said: \u201cOperation Hadin Kai, successfully repelled the insurgents after a fierce fire fight that lasted for almost one hour.\n\nAccording to Bauchi State government, the influx of people from neighbouring Yobe State has made the affected local government areas vulnerable to attacks by the terrorists.\n\nAddressing reporters at the Government House, Bauchi, shortly after an emergency security meeting presided over by Governor Bala Mohammed, Secretary to the Government, Alhaji Sabiu Baba, said five people have been arrested in connection with the mast vandalism.\n\nHe said the suspected terrorists had the intention of blocking communication, in preparation for the attacks.\n\nBaba, however, assured that the state government is working round the clock to beef up security surveillance around neighbouring communities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis influx of the displaced people has put the state under security threat. Our facilities are now overstretched and we are not comfortable with the development. We have decided to commence profiling of all the people coming into Bauchi State, particularly in the four affected LGAs to discover those with dangerous weapons and demonise them.\u201d\n\nBaba added: \u201cThe state government will ensure that the joint operations of the security agencies will be intensified, particularly air surveillance around the affected LGAs.\n\n\u201cAs for those that are displaced persons, government officials will identify them in order to provide relief materials for their well-being because according to him, government will not just watch them suffer.\u201d\n\nThe SSG said Governor Mohammed has provided support to security agencies to intensify patrol and surveillance, particularly in the vulnerable border communities, which share border with Yobe.\n\nOver 10,000 displaced from Geidam attack\n\nThe Executive Secretary of Yobe State Emergency Management Agency (YOSEMA), Dr. Mohammed Goje, lamented that over 10,000 people have been displaced during the attack on Geidam.\n\nGoje said the attack had unleashed humanitarian crisis, adding that it is not advisable to quickly return to Geidam due to security reasons.\n\nGoje also disclosed that there is a large influx of displaced people into Damaturu, the state capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe cooperation of the host community has been encouraging. SEMA has decided to give a lot of support to the households to reduce the burden of the IDPs on them\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe number of displaced people from Geidam keeps increasing. At the moment, we are approaching like 10, 000, based on the ones that we have registered. This is an emergency situation that comes at a time that you least expect. Our contingency plan, for now, is just 10 per cent, which is quite insignificant.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, we have been reaching out to people for the provision of food and non-food items, especially the provision of portable water to the people to drink at their transist location\n\n\u201cThere were rumours that some displaced people want to go back because they have heard that normalcy had returned. But, we have not been communicated officially. So, we cannot take the risk of returning anybody back to Geidam.\n\n\u201cWhat we are encouraging people is to be integrated in the host communities through relatives. We have been going round mobilising food items and shelter kits to the households that are hosting them so that they would not overstretch the available facilities.\n\n\u201cCurrently, our trucks to Mazagum, Bayamari, Yusufari and Yunusari with food items have been mobilised. For Damaturu, we have reached about 1000 individuals as at Wednesday night.

{"title": "Cultists wreak havoc in Anambra communities", "text": "Anambra communities are at the receiving end of the dastardly activities of cultists and the way things stand, help is not coming from the police, writes EMMA ELEKWA\n\nFor some months now, cult-related activities have been on the increase across Anambra state with its attendant calamities. No week seems to pass by without one record of rivalry cult groups clashing among themselves or another.\n\nScores of lives, unfortunately, had been wasted while others had been maimed during such clashes by these young boys and (sometimes) girls at various parts of the state, particularly in Awka, the capital city of the state and its environs.\n\nThe state, which prided itself as the safest state in the country, regrettably is fast losing that testimony in view of frequent cases of cult activities and the alarming number of deaths being recorded in the state.\n\nThe ugly trend has taken a greater dimension following recent attacks on Police formations and personnel by unknown gunmen who had successfully killed several security operatives, razed their formations, and looted their armouries.\n\nThe police, who had hitherto moderated the activities of these cultists, appeared crippled by these killings as many of the officers have gone underground for fear of losing their lives, thereby creating room for a \u201cfree for all\u201d for the cultists.\n\nThese cultists, who apparently have taken advantage of the \u2018absence\u2019 of the police in the state to wreak havoc in the state, had created steady tension and panic among residents of the state.\n\nAside from making life unbearable for the people, the activities of the miscreants have made it difficult for residents to go about their daily activities because of fear of attacks from the youths.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwo weeks ago, three persons were gunned down in a clash between rival cult groups in Awka South Local Government Area of the State. One youth was killed in Umubele, while the other two were killed in Okpuno.\n\nAn eyewitness told The Nation that four young men alighted from a tricycle and opened fire on the boys at Okpuno, while he described that of Umubele, which sent residents scampering for safety as akin to that of a movie.\n\n\u201cNobody is safe in Awka nowadays. These boys kill themselves on a daily basis, but the worst part of it is that policemen are helpless,\u201d the witness said.\n\nResidents of Okija in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State were also said to have been gripped by tension following killings of two persons in a clash of two rival cult groups in the area.\n\nThe incident, which took place in the compound of a former top chief in Umuzu community, witnessed the beheading of one of the victims, while his head was taken away by the assailants.\n\nThe other victim, who was killed somewhere else in the same community, had his feet severed from the ankles in a trending video on social media, while the other parts of the body had machete wounds.\n\nThe former president-general of the community, Chukwudum Ndedigwe, said the compound where the incident happened belonged to their late monarch, Igwe Ubakanonu.\n\nHe said: \u201cOhalegbu, Umuogu and Umuzu villages where the killing of the young man took place are the descendants of Ikeasomba, our great grandfather.\u201d\n\nIn the same town, four persons were killed and one admitted in a hospital after renewed cult activities.\n\nA young man was said to have had his head severed in the presence of his nonagenarian mother and taken away by suspected cultists.\n\nThree persons were killed while the latest victim, who hailed from Umuatuegwu village, was hit by a stray bullet when rival cults were exchanging gunfire.\n\nA source said members of the groups created tension in the area as they continued to harass each other at the busy Nkwo Okija Market.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAs I am speaking, there is a commotion at the Nkwo Market and the disturbing thing is that these boys are using the opportunity to extort money from people.\n\n\u201cThose who refuse to give them money usually have their cars torched. The development has forced many people to hurriedly leave the market for their homes.\u201d\n\nHe said police personnel had been deployed in the area, adding that the expectation was that they would return normalcy to the town.\n\nJust between last Sunday and Monday, six persons were reportedly gunned down in separate attacks between suspected cultists within the state capital.\n\nOne person was shot dead at a motor park, another near UNIZIK Junction, while another one was shot at a beer parlour near Aroma junction).\n\nTwo others were killed at Ifite, Awka on Sunday, while a young man was also gunned down at Amansea on Monday.\n\nA resident of the area, who said the assailants drove in with tricycles at each of the operations, also disclosed that one of the deceased was a fitness instructor in a gym and a councillor in one of the local government areas in the state\n\nThe situation is not different in Onitsha, the commercial city of the state. Aside from the cult-related activities, robbery of all forms had been on the rise.\n\nA lady, who preferred anonymity, narrated how she escaped a robbery attack on Obosi Road\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople should avoid entering Onitsha late if they are driving in order to avoid being caught in traffic. They now target people in traffic and rob them in turns.\n\n\u201cI now leave my office much earlier after a woman\u2019s windscreen was smashed with a cutlass and she was robbed along Obosi Road. She was like three cars before me. Still haven\u2019t gotten over the shock. I was lucky her car was the last to be robbed before they took off. Please, let\u2019s all be careful. These hoodlums are mean.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Chukwuma Egwu, described the cult killings in the state as alarming.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the city of Awka? The killings are getting too much. Ifite and Amansea have not known peace for a while now. The level of cultism among the youths in town is so alarming.\n\n\u201cOne was killed last week after burying his father, other killings ensued. This morning, four have been murdered along the same axis,\u201d he lamented.\n\nLeaders and other stakeholders in the state have continued to express worry over the ugly development, calling on government and security agencies to rise to the occasion.\n\nThe Special Assistant to Governor Willie Obiano on Political Matters, Ifeatu Obi-Okoye, while speaking on \u201cCultism: The role of women in combating menace amongst youths\u201d at a leadership summit, urged parents to beef up their involvement in curbing the cultism, which he blamed on failed homes.\n\nTracing the history of cultism in Nigeria, Obi-Okoye identified poor leadership, poverty and peer group pressures responsible for increasing cult activities, calling for its eradication from home.\n\nThe traditional ruler of Ogidi, Igwe Pharmacist Alex Uzor Onyido, frowned at the increasing menace, calling on parents to intensify their efforts in providing guidance to their children.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chiedu Igbokwe, urged parents to warn their children on the dangers of drug abuse, as well as to instil in them, the spirit of hard work.\n\nHe also recommended education, the establishment of community counselling centres, inclusion of drug abuse in the school curriculum, sensitisation, among others, as measures to curb drug abuse and cultism in society.\n\nThe President, Ogidi Women (Home and Abroad), Hon. Mrs. Ify Okonkwo, lamented the increasing cases of cultism and other vices among the youths, calling for a holistic approach by women and other stakeholders to find a lasting solution to curbing them.\n\nShe said it was not time for parents to sit on the fence and watch citizens of the state suffered at the hands of the cultists, neither was it time to be docile and unresponsive to the ugly trends.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe menace of cultism is glaringly seen and felt, following the recent development in our dear state. Such notorious groups must be discouraged \u2013 here, women and mothers have roles to play in cautioning their wards.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, parents must ensure they pay closer attention to their children to prevent them from indulging in illicit drug intakes. The negative effect of drug abuse on our children is staggering: It is often a catalyst for other heinous crimes in our dear community and state.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, without women involvement and engagement in leadership positions, our community will be in imminent jeopardy. We need women to change the status quo in our society.\u201d\n\nA public commentator, Victor Aguiyi, blamed the situation on years of unbridled bribery among the Police.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a psychological dimension to security. The political symbolism attached to it scares. Ask Bakassi boys and SARS. Too many weapons in private hands, too many drugs close to the noses or palates of younger people.\n\n\u201cFailure of police over the years of unbridled bribery to do the right things. These are dangerous times.\u201d\n\nFor Tony Okafor, a lawyer, the Police should not be totally blamed for their temporary withdrawal from duty posts, describing it as a wise step to take at the instance.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think we need to empathize with the police at this stage. They are not superhuman. They are parents, husbands and wives. They have families. When they suddenly become targets of attacks, it\u2019s only wise that they should retreat and re-plan their strategy.\u201d\n\nWhile confirming most of the cult incidents, Police spokesperson Tochukwu Ikenga had assured residents of the state that the force was on top of the situation.\n\nHe said series of arrests have been made, while police operatives were on track to apprehend those at large.\n\nIkenga added that the Commissioner of Police, Monday Kuryas, had called for calm and also called on parents to pay closer attention to their wards.", "summary": "Anambra communities are at the receiving end of the dastardly activities of cultists and the way things stand, help is not coming from the police, writes EMMA ELEKWAFor some months now, cult-related activities have been on the increase across Anambra state with its attendant calamities.\nThese cultists, who apparently have taken advantage of the \u2018absence\u2019 of the police in the state to wreak havoc in the state, had created steady tension and panic among residents of the state.\nA young man was said to have had his head severed in the presence of his nonagenarian mother and taken away by suspected cultists.\nJust between last Sunday and Monday, six persons were reportedly gunned down in separate attacks between suspected cultists within the state capital.\nTracing the history of cultism in Nigeria, Obi-Okoye identified poor leadership, poverty and peer group pressures responsible for increasing cult activities, calling for its eradication from home.", "link": "https://thenationonlineng.net/cultists-wreak-havoc-in-anambra-communities/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["activities", "killed", "havoc", "state", "cultism", "young", "persons", "anambra", "wreak", "cultists", "cult", "women", "communities", "parents", "community"]}

Mr. President, you need to create a platform to hear Nigerians out.\u201d\n\nAnyim said every violent agitation originates from a non-violent agitation that was not attended to. He said the current violent agitations originated from non-violent agitations, like Boko Haram started as a non-violent procession. He lamented that the herders/farmers clashes had degenerated into a deadly conflict with many states now bloody theatres of war.\n\n\u201cEthnic conflicts in Kaduna, Ebonyi, Cross River, Benue, Plateau states are escalating to an unmanageable scale; banditry in virtually all states of the federation, particularly Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Niger, Sokoto has overwhelmed the law enforcement agencies, kidnaping which has become occupational in most parts of the country. To worsen matters, Boko Haram, has acquired new impetus that they now overrun the military and have even expanded their base to Niger State. IPOB has become a regional challenge.

{"title": "FG Moves to Curb Small Arms Influx, Establishes Control Centre", "text": "\u2022Bauchi raises the alarm over Boko Haram threat to four LGAs\n\n\u2022National Security Council reconvenes today\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe federal government yesterday intensified its efforts to curb the rising influx of small arms and light weapons into the country, a phenomenon believed to be responsible for the worsening insecurity in the polity.\n\nIt established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW).\n\nA statement yesterday by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and signed by Head, Strategic Communication, Mr. Zachari Usman, said the centre would be headed by Maj. Gen. A.M. Dikko (rtd) as pioneer coordinator.\n\nThis comes as the Bauchi State Government raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local government areas in the state.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to finetune strategy at combating insecurity, the National Security Council (NSC), headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, will reconvene today in Abuja to proffer lasting solutions to the security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe ONSA statement said the new centre, to be domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, would replace the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons and serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cThis decision is part of the ongoing restructuring of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture to address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the proliferation of SALW across national borders in Africa and the Sahel region has resulted in terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime, and insurrections in West Africa and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs one of the measures in tackling this threat, the new centre will be fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export, and Manufacture of Light Weapons as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\u201d\n\nIt said the centre would serve as the national focal point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving government Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, the United Nations and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geo-political zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources,\u201d it added.\n\nThe ONSA said the pioneer National Coordinator, Dikko, had served in various capacities in and outside Nigeria.\n\nHe was a course director at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Centre and Chief Instructor of the Nigerian Army Peacekeeping Centre.\n\nHe was also a Military Adviser, United Nation Office for West Africa, Director Peacekeeping Operations Defence Headquarters, Commander Operation Last Hold as well as Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\nHowever, security analysts have criticised the federal government\u2019s action, saying the establishment of the centre without a strategy for the control of the influx of arms through the nation\u2019s porous borders and the application of technology to monitor the movement of arms will make the centre become another bureaucratic arrangement not too different from the defunct presidential committee originally set up for the same purpose.\n\nA former Director of State Security (DSS), Mr. Mike Ejiofor, said the federal government should have applied the funding in procuring arms instead of creating another bureaucracy for diversion of funds.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhat is there? There was a committee on small and light weapons that was in place before. There should have been an audit of the one there before to see the successes and failures. It\u2019s just another source of diversion of funds to me.\n\n\u201cAs I said we need to restructure and we need state police. I don\u2019t think they will achieve any results. Are you going to force people to bring their arms without the existing structure, the security agencies?\u201d\n\nHe added that the funding for the centre would have been deployed in the procurement of arms.\n\n\u201cThat is a diversion and still aimed at wasting our resources that would have been used to purchase armament,\u201d he said.\n\nA retired security personnel of the equivalent rank of major general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the centre as another duplication of bureaucracy, stressing that bureaucracies would not be able to manage borders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a duplication of bureaucracy. Whatever they try to do is a waste of time if the necessary things are not done.\n\n\u201cThey need a drone capacity that works 24 hours, seven days a week.\n\n\u201cIf they are serious about mopping up arms, the centre will need strong vehicular and air platforms (helicopters) to be able to respond quickly when arms smugglers are cited. That is where the work of such a centre is located,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that if the centre would not be able to manage porous borders and apply drone technology in monitoring borders, it would not be successful.\n\n\u201cIf it cannot monitor the borders, it won\u2019t work. Bureaucracies cannot manage borders without technology. A drone technology that will be able to see who is coming in through the borders to monitor who is bringing in arms\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the borders in the North are almost unmanageable and a free for all situation.\n\nAlso, Executive Director, Rule of Law and Advocacy Center (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the government\u2019s strategy to counter the threat of terrorism was ineffective.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe responses adopted by the government are replete with flaws. The counterterrorism efforts of the government of Nigeria are mainly centred on military action and not guided by the national strategy (National Counter-Terrorism Strategy) released in 2014.\n\n\u201cEven the NACTEST has been found to be fraught with gaps that question its suitability as a policy document for countering terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary to emplace a people-centred strategy for countering terrorism in Nigeria. Such a strategy must employ both government and non-governmental approaches.\n\n\u201cI truly don\u2019t see where the establishment of a centre for small and light weapons control comes in within the existing strategy. Experience shows that many people in government saddled with responsibilities think rather more about how to create new opportunities for patronage rather than well thought through initiatives that address the issues\u201d.\n\nIn his contribution, a Principal Officer of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), Mr. Emeka Umeagbalasi, said security challenges confronting the nation at the moment might render the centre ineffective.\n\nHe wondered if the centre would deal with all components of the country fairly in its operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe question is how will the policy or centre work? Will it be evenly or unevenly implemented?\n\n\u201cHow do you recover arms from Boko Haram, ISWAP and herdsmen who have already taken up arms against the state?\u201d\n\nHe stated that if the centre intended to mop up arms, it would require \u201cmobilised disarmament\u201d at peacetime which he said was better organised by international agencies.\n\nAccording to him, NCCSALW would be more effective when the country is seen as one.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is a fire brigade approach and a smokescreen,\u201d he added.\n\nOffering further clarification, a source at ONSA said six zonal coordinating offices were being set up.\n\n\u201cThe presidential committee (defunct) didn\u2019t have an institutional mechanism because currently, the disposition does not favour a whole new bureaucracy to undertake law enforcement work. The NCCSALW, like the Counter Terrorism Centre, will serve the purpose, coordinating other security agencies to effectively tackle the proliferation of SALW.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Border Closure Swift Response Exercise became Joint Border Patrol Team in which Nigeria is working with neighbouring countries in several areas including on small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe new centre will now have personnel drawn from other services to provide the technical input and undertake the work of mopping up illegal arms,\u201d he added.\n\nBauchi Raises the Alarm over Boko Haram Threat to Four LGAs\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Government has raised the alarm that bandits and people displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the neighbouring Yobe State have infiltrated four local governments of Dambam, Gamawa, Darazo and Zaki in the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Mohammed Baba, raised the alarm yesterday while addressing journalists after an emergency security council meeting in Bauchi.\n\n\u201cFollowing the overrunning of Geidam in Yobe State by the Boko Haram militants, there has been an influx of people into the state through four LGAs in the northern part of the Bauchi State.

We heard the comments of the Kaduna State governor that he will not pay ransom to bandits to purchase additional arms.\n\n\u201cIf they fail to bring N100 million and 10 brand new Honda motorcycles known as Boko Haram by Tuesday, I can assure you they will use trucks to evacuate the bodies of the remaining students,\u201d Jalingo was quoted as saying in the interview.\n\nHe said five of the abducted students were killed to prove that the state and the federal governments had failed.\n\nJalingo described himself as a \u201cfood seeker,\u201d when asked if he is a terrorist.\n\nHe also warned security agencies against planting trackers on the motorcycles, as his members don\u2019t go to towns, stressing that arresting them would be difficult.\n\nOne of the abducted students, Abigail Usman, also spoke during the telephone interview, calling on the government and parents to pay the ransom \u201cso that they will not kill us.\u201d\n\nKaduna State police spokesman, Mr. Mohammed Jalinge; and the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan did not respond to inquiries when contacted.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the university authorities were unsuccessful as the mobile phone of the registrar, Mr. Bashir Mohammed, was switched off.\n\nSuspected Herdsmen Kill 17 People in Benue\n\nMeanwhile, no fewer than 17 people were feared killed yesterday by suspected herdsmen in Tse Angbeghe Udam Aondoana and Agbanu Seghev/Ukuse in Gwer West Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Felicia Anor, who survived the attack, the herdsmen came through Akpachi in Otukpo Local Government Area and launched the attack on Tse Angbeghe, killing 15 people while 26 others sustained injuries.\n\nThe attackers also blocked the Naka Nagi Agagbe road killing two people on a motorcycle while four others were injured.\n\nThe attack prompted a peaceful protest in Naka town by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Gwer West Chapter.\n\nA pastor in the area, Mr. Sule Sunday, on behalf of the Christian community, expressed sadness over the persistent attack on the communities.\n\nHe called on the government to intervene. A resident pastor in the area, Rev. Shamange, urged security operatives to go after the attackers to disclaim the speculations that security agencies had compromised in their assignment.\n\nAn indigene of the local government and a journalist, Mr. Francis Ugbede, said the herdsmen had taken over seven council wards of Sengev , Gaagev/Tongev, Saghev/Ukusu, Tough Ateer/ Ijaha, Gaambe Ushin and Mbachohon Avihijme.\n\nHe called for increased security patrols in the local communities.\n\nMeanwhile, security personnel have been drafted to the area to prevent further attacks.\n\nAccording to the state Police PRO (DSP), Ms. Catherine Anene, the police are aware of the incident.\n\nShe, however, could not confirm the number of people killed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n", "summary": "The Kaduna students, numbering about 22, were abducted on April 18 when the hoodlums invaded the school about 8:30 pm.\nJalingo said 17 students, comprising 15 girls and two boys, were in his custody, including the grandson of the late Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris, whose name was given as Hamza.\nHe stated that the families of the abducted students had already paid N55 million, but they had spent the money to feed the students.\nHe said five of the abducted students were killed to prove that the state and the federal governments had failed.\nA pastor in the area, Mr. Sule Sunday, on behalf of the Christian community, expressed sadness over the persistent attack on the communities.", "link": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/05/04/bandits-threaten-to-kill-abducted-greenfield-university-students-today/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["area", "students", "threaten", "greenfield", "bandits", "state", "mr", "abducted", "17", "security", "university", "ransom", "attack", "kill", "today", "herdsmen"]}

{"title": "MTN Nigeria\u2019s Q1 2021 results show it may be quietly poised for fintech leadership", "text": "Nigeria\u2019s leading telecoms provider, MTN Nigeria, has released its financial report for the first quarter of 2021, showing strong performance despite losing 5 million customers.\n\nA recent policy by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) suspended the registration of new SIM cards. This suspension meant that as telecoms operators like MTN lost subscribers through churn, they could not add new customers. Active data users also declined marginally by 71,000 to 32.5 million.\n\nDespite the decline, MTN still showed strong performance in Q1 as Profit before tax grew by 33.9% to N102.9 billion. Karl Toriola, the company\u2019s CEO, summarised the performance perfectly, \u201cWe made good progress in the first quarter of 2021 despite the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nOne big sign of progress for the company is the increase in the data, digital, and fintech revenue even as voice revenue growth remains tepid.\n\nData brings in even more revenue.\n\nAs voice revenue continues to slow down, data revenue is thought to be the future for telecoms companies, and by MTN\u2019s Q1 results, that future looks bright. Data revenue brought in around 36.4% of total revenue.\n\nData contributes massively because of a corresponding increase in how people are using data. MTN recorded an 86.7% increase in data traffic and a 48.5% increase in usage (MB per user) from the existing base.\n\nMTN has expanded its 4G coverage to about 61.8% of the population but what\u2019s more interesting is that in Q1, it added 1.2 million smartphones to its network. 47.5% of the company\u2019s customers now use smartphones.\n\nIt is easy to see why analysts say that data revenue is the future when you consider that less than 47.5% of its customer base contributes over 35% to its total revenue. When smartphone penetration moves to the region of 70%, data revenue could grow even more significant.\n\nBut data revenue isn\u2019t the only thing that is growing, with MTN showing real promise in its fintech efforts.\n\nIs MTN Nigeria posed for fintech leadership?\n\nIn August 2019, MTN launched its mobile money business, MoMo, in Nigeria. Its competitors are companies like OPay and Paga, both of which have talked up some impressive figures at different times.\n\nOPay has claimed to have over 300,000 agents and said that in December 2020, it processed $2 billion in payments.

Centre Stage exists to tell the behind-the-scenes stories of how products and companies are built in Africa. A new Centre Stage story drops every Monday at 3 PM.\n\nAs workplaces continue to re-open, many organizations are adopting the hybrid work model \u2013 a new working style that combines work remotely and from the office.\n\nThe hybrid work model is perfect for most businesses, especially those with heavy dependence on their operations and customer service teams.\n\nKobo360 is an example of a company with a robust operational and customer service team. The logistics startup helps cargo owners request and schedule trucks to pick up and deliver their goods to specified destinations.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to manage a call centre via Zoom and Meet. Kobo360 needed a new office that was uniquely designed to fit their business operations needs.\n\nTheir office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts. Innovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nYinka meets Kobo360\u2019s co-founders\n\nSo, what goes into planning and setting up a meeting with the founders of a YC-backed startup?\n\nThe first time I met with them was at the end of 2019. During our first meeting, we discussed what they needed in the space and what they were looking for in terms of design and style. And meeting them was a really great experience. Sometimes because of the scale of projects we work on, a lot of our clientele are usually older people. So it was really exciting to work with younger people. They are really brilliant guys.\n\nWas designing the office just a job for you?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. I enjoyed working with them. They understood everything I was saying and we were on the same wavelength. They encouraged and allowed us to be as creative as possible. It was like a match made in heaven for me.\u201d\n\nDealing with tight deadlines and the 2020 pandemic:\n\nWhen you met them, had the company been accepted into YC?\n\n\u201cYes, they had. I first met them at the tail-end of 2018 and the following year, we pretty much came to an agreement about the work that needed to be done, amongst other things.\u201d\n\nDid you know? When Obi Ozor was asked what was getting in the way of Kobo360 becoming a unicorn (a company valued at $1bn or more), Ozor responded with, \u201cWorking capital.\u201d\n\nWhen did work officially start at the site?\n\n[laughs] They gave my team and I a really tight deadline so work pretty much began about two months after I met them. We had a month to design a concept, negotiate and all that; after the ink dried they wanted us on the job ASAP.\n\nWow. That was a really close first start. When was the project completed?\n\nIt was in different phases actually \u2013 the first phase was completed in the middle of 2020 and the second at the end of 2020.\n\nHow did the pandemic affect the work you did for kobo360?\n\nThe pandemic impacted our work in major ways. First, it affected the way we phased and spread out the work. Usually, when we carry out commercial projects, we like to work in four or five phases. It also affected our on-site procedures. We had to regulate working hours and the number of bodies we needed at the site. Proper planning and scheduling became even more important to accomplish our project goals.\n\nKobo360\u2019s office design process\n\nCan you say more about the decision to work in phases and what that looked like for the kobo360 project?\n\nOkay, the first phase I think was the operations floor, and then the call centre. We phase our projects out for several reasons. One reason is financial. We try to ease our client\u2019s financial burdens in terms of commitments. We also consider Kobo360\u2019s operational team. They needed a space to transition into after the lockdown eased in Nigeria. Like I said, we had a really really tight deadline. We pretty much wrapped up the first phase in about a month or two. Wrapping up the first phase quickly allowed us to complete the other portions of the project in good time.\n\nYou mentioned that the founders cared about creativity. Can you tell me about how you accessed the creative side of your mind to specifically do this project.\n\nWe usually try to make all our projects as tailored to the client as much as possible. And we kept that same energy with Kobo360. They are a logistics company which means they pretty much empower freight trucks across Africa.\n\nKeeping their mission in mind, we visualized the expressways and highways freight trucks drive on and utilized them as inspiration for the design of the spine that connects the different functional spaces on the floor. Elements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\n\nWe wanted the space to be a physical representation of what the company actually does in the ecosystem.\n\nInterior photos of 360 Office at Surulere, Lagos.\n\nHow did you and your team visualize what Kobo360\u2019s office would look like?\n\nIt was an iterative process. We watched a few videos about Kobo360 as our own way of trying to get inside the soul of the company. Our research into the company, outside of my conversations with the co-founders, informed our design process. Once we finally got to a place that we were comfortable with, we created 3D renderings and video walkthroughs and presented them to Kobo3060. There were a few back and forth feedback sessions \u2013 which are to be expected \u2013 but we wanted to satisfy our clients.\n\nSource: Innovate Concepts LTD.\n\nTell me something about design that most people don\u2019t know?\n\nDesign must be organic.\n\nOrganic? Say more\u2026\n\nSo, I remember being in school and whenever I heard constructive criticism about my design I got upset because I wanted to have my own way. But later I realised that to be a successful architect, you have to be willing to get other people\u2019s perspectives. So design being organic means it being able to bend and make room for stakeholders in the process.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Kobo360\u2019s office. What areas in the space required special attention?\n\nThe part of the building that houses Kobo360\u2019s call centre required special attention. You know there\u2019s a lot of conversation and noise that happens in call centres. So in designing that space, we made it secluded from the general floor and also used a lot of sound-absorbing materials\u2013 like acoustic ceilings. Sound absorbent materials reduce noise and make an office a more conducive environment for employees to function in.\n\nInterior shoot of Kobo360 Office at Costain Lagos.\n\nSustainability, Nigeria\u2019s architectural industry and Yinka\u2019s early years\n\nHow should Nigeria approach innovation in your industry?\n\nIn Nigeria we typically don\u2019t pay attention to being sustainable and eco-friendly. We prioritize costs and getting the work done quickly. Getting work done quickly is good, but Nigerian architects need to start designing with sustainability in mind. When we scope a building, we construct pathways for natural ventilation and daylight. We also prioritize using local materials over processed ones. This way of thinking seems expensive but in the long term, you actually save more money on energy.\n\nHmm\u2026\n\nWith Kobo360, we used a lot of daylighting in the space. So again, during the day they hardly actually put on any of the artificial lights because there\u2019s a lot of natural light coming in through the large windows placed around the office.\n\nWhy architecture? What inspired you to go down this path?\n\nWhy did I want to study architecture? it\u2019s just something that you know has always been a passion. Funny enough, I was actually inspired by my father. He\u2019s also an architect, so I guess that\u2019s who planted the seed. But yeah I mean I tried it in university and loved it and I\u2019ve never looked back. Architecture is what I have always wanted to do.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria. Yinka moved back home to make a difference in the architectural industry; and he\u2019s doing so by guiding Innovate Concepts, into the future of eco-friendly and culturally relevant design.", "summary": "Their office space vision was brought to life by Yinka Dayo-Adepoju, the lead architect and partner at Innovate Concepts.\nInnovate Concepts LTD is an architectural firm dedicated to designing and building sustainable commercial spaces for mid-sized and large companies.\nLike I said, we had a really really tight deadline.\nElements like traffic signs, zebra crossings and road demarcations and strategic use of vibrant colours are infused around the office space.\nI\u2019m bringing Yinka Dayo-Adepoju to centre stage because he advocates for sustainable commercial and residential buildings in Nigeria.", "link": "https://techcabal.com/2021/05/03/designing-and-building-sustainable-commercial-spaces-in-nigeria/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["office", "way", "spaces", "work", "commercial", "kobo360", "centre", "space", "really", "building", "company", "nigeria", "wanted", "design", "sustainable", "designing"]}

{"title": "The platform and one discussion we are all avoiding \u2013 Nigerian Observer", "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEvery May Day, the Pastor Poju Oyemade-led Covenant Christian Centre, Lagos invites speakers of all shades of opinions to speak at a discussion programme, THE PLATFORM with the view to preferring solutions to Nigeria\u2019s multifaceted problems. At every edition, speakers give brilliant speeches on how best to make the nation work. Speakers like Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Rev. Fr. Matthew Kukah, Governor Peter Obi, and persons of such ilk have spoken at THE PLATFORM on several topical issues from the economy, governance, etc. It\u2019s difficult to see an edition of the programme without a controversial position or character on any selected national discourse or topic. Any curious observer will not fail to notice that most of the discussants speak so much about the problems in governments (federal, states, and local), institutions, systems (whatever that means), the Civil Service, etc, but not a lot of them made any attempt about the role of the citizens in all these. One begins to ask himself or herself if the citizens have any role in all these. This, interestingly, is a discussion we all are, understandably, trying very desperately to avoid.\n\nObserving the challenges of adopting democracies in post-colonial African states, Professor Mahmood Mamdani \u2013 in his seminal work Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late Colonialism \u2013 beautifully and boldly dissects the impacts of colonial mentality in reproducing \u201cracial identity in citizens and ethnic identity in subjects\u201d on the former colonies. Even though Professor Mamdani\u2019s case studies are primarily in two Southern African countries \u2013 Uganda and South Africa \u2013 many of his thoughts are still being firmly reflected in Nigeria today.\n\nThe Colonial State in Africa did not hope to prepare Africans for citizenship. This made locals view everything \u201cGovernment\u201d with so much distrust. Public properties mean nothing other than \u201cnobody\u2019s business\u201d or something to be looted at the slightest opportunity because of poorly defined ownership. An invitation to serve in public office is an opportunity to \u201cpartake in the national cake\u201d. As Nigeria\u2019s foremost novelist, Chinua Achebe, wrote in his No Longer At Ease, once a young (wo)man get appointed or elected into public office, he automatically begins to shoulder the responsibilities of his extended family, his clan, or friends who sees his or her appointment as their window to \u201ctake\u201d their portion from state\u2019s resources, rather than an opportunity to serve. Mr Obi (the central character in the novel), soon found out that the demands from his clan\u2019s people will soon make him engage in corrupt practices as the Secretary of the Scholarship Commission in the Ministry of Education. After all, according to Achebe in A Man of the People, nobody wants to miss \u201ctheir chance of getting \u2026their share of the national cake\u2026\u201d\n\nIn all these, one will notice the patterns have been about what is to be taken from the state. The citizens feel a sense of entitlement without any corresponding value addition. Governance is an opportunity to \u201cchop\u201d, and not to serve. The recent spat between Festus Keyamo and Eedris Abdulkareem over the latter\u2019s new song \u201cJaga Jaga Reloaded\u201d shows how unapologetic many Nigerians see public service as a kind of empowerment scheme with everyone desperately competing for their turn or share.\n\nWhile not saying Government officials shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for their (in)actions or that our institutions need to undergo reforms, one thing we seem to always forget is that these officials who occupy these institutions are also citizens like the rest of us. These institutions or systems won\u2019t run themselves. They will be run by officials who come from within and amongst us. These persons were brought up in the same society, environment, or conditions as most of us. They are not strangers or people from other planets. Getting elected or appointed into public offices won\u2019t just suddenly change them into something they are not. The Professor who was recently caught collecting money to rig for one of the candidates in an election he served as Returning Officer, has probably cheated all his life undetected. If not, he couldn\u2019t just have developed the cheating trait all of a sudden. No one teaches old dogs some new tricks. Old habits die hard. The Twitter influencer, who recently bagged a PhD, says \u201cintegrity doesn\u2019t put food on the table or pay bills\u201d because a virtuous woman returned money (running into millions) she found at an airport to the owner has probably lived his life believing cheating or gaming systems will be the best way to go. If we check properly, I won\u2019t be surprised his doctoral thesis will be a huge academic fraud since he sees no problem with academic dishonesty. If these characters finding their ways into public offices, they will surely have no issues violating the Procurement Act in the contract bidding process in favour of their friends, families, or other close relatives since integrity \u201cdoesn\u2019t put food on the table\u2026\u201d There are always clues if we are paying enough attention!\n\nI have also read through the 1999 Constitution and say how well detailed the framers of the documents spelt out the rights of citizens from Sections 33 to 45. Something that is conspicuously missing in the same Constitution the Section dealing with the responsibilities of citizens. Even in Sections 25 to 32 where CITIZENSHIP is established, not a single mention of their responsibilities. Well, this can\u2019t simply be an innocent oversight on the part of the framers of the Constitution. They are simply too aware of the kind of citizens we are. John F. Kennedy knew what he was saying when he said \u201c\u2026 ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country\u201d during his inaugural address as the 35th US President in 1961.\n\nWe can talk (or rant) so much about how rascally public officials behave at every talk shows. We can talk about how \u201cpoliticians are dragging us back\u201d or how the nation is not working. We can speak passionately about how the devolution of powers will be the magic wand to solve all our problems. We can speak about how changing parties in government will be the almighty formula to all our challenges.\n\nWe will keep leaving out the serious issues around the crisis of citizenship. How can the nation work when everyone just wants to \u201ctake\u201d without giving back anything in return? A nation where people only talk about rights (getting) without corresponding responsibilities (giving back) won\u2019t work. It\u2019s like being employed in a company but just want to be collecting salaries monthly without giving much or anything in return. As noted by Frantz Fanon in his The Wretched of the Earth, \u201cA government or a party gets the people it deserves and sooner or later a people gets the government it deserves.\u201d It\u2019s obvious we are avoiding this discussion but we will come back to it someday whether or not we like it. This will be part of my contributions to THE PLATFORM if I\u2019m ever invited to speak!\n\n_______________________________________\n\nOlalekan Adigun, a public affairs analyst, writes from Lagos.

So, inculcating traditions of freedom as part of their emergence is a multiplier force for the kind of society we want to build in the future.\n\nNUCJ: There is no press freedom on Nigeria\u2019s campuses,\u201d is this claim correct and why should it be important?\n\nOlorunyomi: Campuses are microsets of the larger Nigerian community. By all parameters, press freedom is deteriorating in Nigeria as a whole. That answers the question by half. However, the challenge, always, is to struggle to extend the context and boundaries of freedom. If we want to fully entrench press freedom on our campuses, we must understand the ramification of the concept itself. There are four key components: [a] the legislative context created by campus regulations, [b] the independence offered through training, ethics, [c] the pluralism offered by the diversity of content and actors like the gender inclusivity of campus journos and [d] the safety of campus journos. To entrench the regime of press freedom on campuses we need to build these four pillars concretely.\n\nNUCJ: Do you have any hope in the Student Bill of Rights to protect campus journalists?\n\nOlorunyomi: I have not seen or studied the bill. I look forward to seeing it. However, it can be a potent force of change if managed with skill, and an inclusive constituency of campus actors built to sell it. It can make a difference to traditions of freedom across the board.\n\nNUCJ: On a final note, our goal is to call public attention to the erosion of press freedom on Nigeria\u2019s campuses, are we paranoid? What can be done? Your suggestions sir.\n\nOlorunyomi: No, you are not. Campuses need to be freed. Backstory: Dec 1982 @ 3rd Annual conference of NANS, we passed an idealistic Charter of Demands to democratise education in Nigeria. It became the basis of many educational reforms of the 90s. Let\u2019s go back to history and build back better!\n\nParticipants\u2019 Questions\n\nGbolagade Sunday: How can we ascertain press freedom when the financial capability of such institution\u2019s editorial board lies in the hand of the Management and Students\u2019 Union in that school?\n\nOlorunyomi: True, a financially disabled press can hardly be functional, independent, pluralistic, or even safe. However, this is a call-up to creativity. We need new strategies on how to finance campus in the new age. I sense that the current exco has reinvigorated the NUCJ to a new active tempo. What needs to be added are fresh strategies on how to finance our activities. That is the next gap to be filled.", "summary": "Excerpts of the Tweetchat below:NUCJ: What is your philosophy about Press Freedom?\nNUCJ: There is no press freedom on Nigeria\u2019s campuses,\u201d is this claim correct and why should it be important?\nIf we want to fully entrench press freedom on our campuses, we must understand the ramification of the concept itself.\nTo entrench the regime of press freedom on campuses we need to build these four pillars concretely.\nNUCJ: On a final note, our goal is to call public attention to the erosion of press freedom on Nigeria\u2019s campuses, are we paranoid?", "link": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/features-and-interviews/459291-interview-how-nigerian-university-campuses-can-entrench-press-freedom-premium-times-publisher.html", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["times", "entrench", "publisher", "journalism", "freedom", "interview", "nucj", "union", "university", "press", "campus", "nigerian", "nigeria", "premium", "build", "campuses", "need"]}

{"title": "FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie Agents Hits 100,000 \u2013 Impacting Hundreds of Thousands of Lives and Communities Across Nigeria", "text": "By JOHN MOMODU\n\nIf you live in Lagos, Abuja or Port Harcourt, or you reside in any of the other state capitals, you probably take for granted that you actually live in the better of the two worlds that make up Nigeria when it comes to banking. Take Lagos, for example, you would find a bank in almost any corner you turn. You have many streets in business or commercial areas in the city that are lined up by nothing but banks in all their glory and magnificence. If a count is taken, it could be established that there are probably more bank branches in Lagos than any other branded business outlets or branded activity centres \u2013 if street stores and religious centres are excluded.\n\nMany people in city centres somehow assume that this situation of banks being in your face in cities is the same reality that prevails in most parts of the country. They have no idea that there are parts of Nigeria, especially the hinterland, where people take the absence of banks for granted the same way city dwellers take the preponderance of bank branches for granted. To get to the nearest bank, people in the hinterland who live this reality every day would have to travel many kilometres to get to their state capitals or some other large towns. These are the people living in the worse of the two worlds you find in Nigeria as far as having bank presence is concerned.\n\nImagine if the situation were reversed and city dwellers had to travel many kilometres to get to the nearest bank branch where they could do their transactions. It is not unlikely that such a situation would be accompanied by a ballooning of the stress levels in city dwellers, increased road rage on city highways and heightened frustration generally. How would people who spend multiple hours in traffic on a daily basis, work longer than counterparts elsewhere for far less remuneration, enjoy less sleep on their beds and less time with family and loved ones, cope with the additional burden of walking or driving endlessly in search of a bank to do their transactions? How? Just how?\n\nSo city dwellers should indeed be thankful for their world. And while at it, they as well as people in the hinterland, who live in the other world, should not be shy to extend appreciation to those working so hard and tirelessly to bridge the gap between the two worlds in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) financial inclusion initiative geared towards bringing the unbanked and underbanked as well as communities in Nigeria\u2019s hinterland into the formal financial ecosystem has been key to efforts to bridge the gap. The CBN\u2019s mandate to ensure the availability of affordable financial products and services to all individuals and groups of people in Nigeria, regardless of location, literacy level, familiarity with technology or accessibility to modern infrastructural facilities, has been wholly embraced, supported and promoted by FirstBank.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s unmatched commitment to financial inclusion is informed by the bank\u2019s undivided focus on making real impact across Nigeria. Hear Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, the Chief Executive Officer of the premier bank in West Africa and the leading financial inclusion services provider in Nigeria for over 127 years: \u201cThe key strength of our franchise is our ability to look at gaps in the society and develop products and services that [address those gaps].\u201d Continuing, he notes that as an integral part of the bank\u2019s strategy, \u201cWe believe that by significantly working with the Central Bank to improve the financial inclusion index of the country, we would, as FirstBank, be assisting [the] country to address poverty, to address hunger, thereby also promoting security of life and property because when people are gainfully employed, the implication is that they think less of crime.\u201d\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that FirstBank has driven the financial inclusion initiative much more vigorously than any other bank in Nigeria, with its Firstmonie Agent channel, which crossed the 100,000 Agents mark a few days ago, being among the bank\u2019s many initiatives to expand financial access in the country. The 100,000 Agents feat in itself speaks volumes about the bank\u2019s strides in the financial inclusion space. No other bank comes anywhere close to FirstBank in terms of number and spread of agents in their agent banking networks. FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie Agents and the thousands of staff they employ are in all the 774 local government areas in Nigeria save two and, in 2020 alone, processed over 295 million transactions with a total value of N6.65 trillion and opened more than 196,000 accounts. However, for FirstBank, it is not about number or competition with others or even being the largest bank-led network in Africa, but the impact the Firstmonie Agents channel it is creating, as Dr Adeduntan highlighted above. His deputy, Francis Shobo agrees, saying FirstBank is looking beyond numbers and considering impact. He makes a bold declaration, \u201cWe are trying to make those Agents the centre of the financial ecosystem in the country.\u201d This probably explains why Firstmonie Agents are considered by the bank as community heroes that it is planting all over the nation. And this is the sense one gets in interviews with Agents and customers across the country.\n\nAiyetoro is a riverine community in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State. It has no banks, according to Stephen Adeleye, a Firstmonie Agent serving Aiyetoro community. He recounts how Firstmonie has impacted his community. Adeleye says Firstmonie has provided easy access to banking ensuring that \u201cpeople in the community now have this kind of savings habit\u201d \u2013 a reference to the growing savings culture in Aiyetoro. One of his customers, Tina Farodoye, who operates a grocery store in the community says Firstmonie has helped her business to grow. She can now buy her stock in bulk all the way from Lagos where they are relatively inexpensive (even with transport costs added) compared to her community, all because she is able to transfer funds through Agent Stephen to the wholesalers in Lagos. This has improved her business profitability by increasing the profit margin in her business.\n\nEphraim Osinachi, is a Firstmonie Agent in Obehie, Asa Ukwa West, Abia State. He serves customers across all ages, including the very aged, as all customers are assisted with their transactions, unlike the use of ATM where the customer is practically on their own. He says market traders take advantage of his presence in the community to make lodgements at the end of the day\u2019s trade. He and his staff wait until traders are done at the market (unlike your regular banks which shut their doors to customers at four o\u2019clock, generally). The advantage this offers the people is invaluable. He cites a case where a customer\u2019s house was raided by robbers in their absence and all the robbers could find after ransacking the entire house was fifty naira cash and old phones valued at N3,000. His services are enabling his community to avoid keeping bulk cash at home and the consequent risk of being robbed and traumatised by men of the underworld.\n\nOrode Hesse, Firstmonie Agent in Ubeji, Warri South, Delta State is both emphatic and ecstatic about impact Firstmonie has had on her life. She enthuses that it has really impacted and empowered her financially and enabled her to empower others, especially other women. She has six employees, five of whom are female. So she sees Firstmonie as a business or platform to employ and empower women. Interestingly, Orode is part of the 26 per cent of Firstmonie Agents that are women, a fact that points to the important role Firstmonie is playing in driving women economic empowerment.\n\nAbubakar Aki Bolaji, is a Firstmonie Agent along Karishi Road, Orozo in FCT, Abuja. He points out that the nearest bank to his community is 15km away. He is pleased that his presence as an Agent in the community has cut out the costs of transportation his people would have continued to incur in order to access banking services. His sentiment and delight are shared by the teeming customers he serves. This situation is very common in the North given its landmass and the dispersed nature of human settlements. Dr Adeduntan relates how a senior government official in Jigawa State highlighted how important the presence of Firstmonie Agents was when he informed him that all across a 70km stretch from Gumel, where there was the branch of a bank, there were no banks anywhere in sight. All he saw were at least two Firstmonie Agents in that long stretch of 70km, no banks. Without those two Agents, all the people in the settlements along that 70km stretch would be without access to banking services.\n\nAnother Firstmonie Agent, Mohammed Tatari, serving Tudun Wada in Bununu, Bauchi State, says his services are helping to drive commerce in his community as traders are now able to transfer funds to the wholesalers elsewhere from whom they buy. His services are helping traders to avoid carrying large cash with them given the dire security situation. He noted that the people used to travel elsewhere just to access banking service. His presence has changed all that now. He concludes that Firstmonie is changing his community (for good). One woman who would agree with him is Halima, a housewife and petty trader in the outskirts of Abuja. She discovered Firstmonie through her co-tenant, during the recent lockdown due to COVID-19, and was excited that she could access funds at the Firstmonie Agent outlet close to her and send money to her mother in far away, Maiduguri in Borno State. She had been unable to move to Garki where her bank branch was because of the lockdown.\n\nBesides ensuring that individuals in the suburbs do not have to travel for long hours to the city for their banking activities, Firstmonie Agents are also bridging the gap between the tech-savvy and the low-literacy clients as the Agent network represents the convenient and comfortable alternative for customers that are unacquainted with sophisticated digital channels. And as Firstmonie Agents give their best, FirstBank, on its part, has been doing everything to encourage the Agents. In its inaugural Firstmonie Agent Banking Awards, FirstBank rewarded 37 leading Agents that have promoted financial inclusion in the country. Thirty-one (31) Agents each won the sum of N250,000 at the state level while five Agents won the sum of N1,000,000 at the regional level. At the national level, the grand prize of N2,500,000 was won by Zayyanu Hassan Ishaq, an Agent from Abuja (North Central), who described it as a miracle and noted that it would spur him to work harder.\n\nAs further encouragement and to promote the business activities of Firstmonie Agents, the bank announced the provision of loan facilities of up to N1,000,000 to the Agents. This new credit scheme, which they can access 24 hours a day, can be processed in less than two minutes. The scheme means more empowerment and business expansion for Firstmonie Agents. And the expansion can go beyond Nigeria as Dr Adeduntan says FirstBank is looking beyond Nigeria to other African countries where FirstBank operates, like Ghana and DRC \u2013 a country with over 80 million people \u2013 to promote financial inclusion and begin to address poverty on the African continent through the Firstmonie platform.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "summary": "Interestingly, Orode is part of the 26 per cent of Firstmonie Agents that are women, a fact that points to the important role Firstmonie is playing in driving women economic empowerment.\nAbubakar Aki Bolaji, is a Firstmonie Agent along Karishi Road, Orozo in FCT, Abuja.\nAnd as Firstmonie Agents give their best, FirstBank, on its part, has been doing everything to encourage the Agents.\nAs further encouragement and to promote the business activities of Firstmonie Agents, the bank announced the provision of loan facilities of up to N1,000,000 to the Agents.\nThe scheme means more empowerment and business expansion for Firstmonie Agents.", "link": "https://daylightng.com/firstbanks-firstmonie-agents-hits-100000-impacting-hundreds-of-thousands-of-lives-and-communities-across-nigeria/", "published": "05/04/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["bank", "lives", "community", "state", "hits", "agent", "firstbank", "hundreds", "agents", "financial", "banks", "nigeria", "firstmonie", "communities", "thousands", "impacting", "firstbanks"]}

{"title": "ANALYSIS: New Policy Fails To Reverse Gas Flaring, Importation", "text": "May 3, 2021 441\n\nTo reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\n\nThe initiative was introduced in 2016 to eliminate gas flaring by capturing it during oil exploration and making the gas available for sale to private firms who will be screened through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe plan was that by 2020, the programme being handled by a team of professionals led by the Project Manager, Justice Derefaka, will bring gas flaring to an end.\n\nHowever, as of April 2021, the practice which leads to waste of significant volume of gas resources and potential revenue continues despite the existence of a regulation and insufficient local supply of gas to meet demand.\n\nIn order to achieve zero gas flaring by 2020, a framework was designed to ensure an open, fair and transparent bidding process by investors who will monetise flare gas, that the investors get the gas at a fair price, improve flare gas monitoring and flare payment enforcement.\n\nThe country has missed the 2020 target as this valuable energy resource is wasted and more money is misused on importation of gas to plug gaps in local production. At the same time, Nigeria\u2019s gas-powered electricity plants suffer from gas shortage leading to widespread regular power outage.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Imports 58% Cooking Gas From Equatorial Guinea, Others\n\nNigeria has been in the practice of setting gas flaring elimination targets and missing them as seen in the target set for 2007, 2008, and 2010.\n\nWhy Is Gas Flaring A Problem For Nigeria?\n\nFor over 60 years, Nigeria has been battling with gas flaring, which is a common practice during oil extraction when natural gas is burned instead of removing, re-injection or storing for sale.\n\nThis natural gas that is allowed to burn in the atmosphere leaves releases excess amount to carbondioxide and methane, causing environmental pollution, affecting health, safety, and quality of life in the environment.\n\nNigeria successive government administrations have reiterated their commitment to cleaning up the industry and the Nigeria Delta region but despite warnings and deadlines by the Federal Government to oil companies to stop gas flaring, the practice still continues.\n\nNigeria has the largest proven reserve of gas in Africa and the seventh largest gas flaring nation in the world for nine years running according to a latest report by the World Bank.\n\nHowever, the report stated that Nigerian has recorded significant progress over the past 15 years as the country has reduced its gas flaring by 70 percent to just 7 billion cubic metres in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, data from the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR) showed that oil and gas companies flared 330.93 million scf of gas equivalent to a potential revenue loss of N243.04 billion.\n\nThe following year, the country lost 288.92 million scf of gas to flaring amounting to N229.86 billion. In 2017, over 324.19 million scf of gas was flared equivalent to potential revenue of N267.85 billion while in 2018, 282.08 million scf gas valued at N233.05 billion was burnt off and wasted.\n\nIn January and February alone, data obtained from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) showed that a total of 26.06 billion standard cubic feet of natural gas was flared in January and February 2021.\n\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\n\nImporting Gas In The Midst Of Abundant Reserves\n\nFor some years now, Nigeria has been importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as cooking gas for neighboring countries as well as the India and United States in order to meet up with local demand.\n\nAccording to the data obtained by BizWatch Nigeria from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA)), more than half of the cooking gas consumed in the country in the first three months of the year was imported from Equatorial Guinea and two other countries.\n\nNigeria, which ranks as the ninth largest natural gas reserve globally, imports cooking gas from Equatorial Guinea, which has only 1.3 trillion cubic feet gas reserves and ranks as the 65th largest globally.\n\nMarketers also imported from the United States and Argentina during the period under review to bridge the production shortfall.\n\nThe report showed that marketers imported a total of 170,419.286 metric tonnes from January to March this year.\n\nREAD ALSO: OPEC Agrees To Ease Crude Oil Production Cuts From May\n\nWhile they were only able to produce 123,498.317 metric tonnes of cooking gas during the period under review, representing 42 per cent of total gas consumed during that period.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, Mr Bassey Essien, explained that the majority of the cooking gas produced is exported and reimported.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the gas we consume is imported, with the associated high costs, based on foreign exchange availability.\n\n\u201cSo, when gas is readily available, and supply outstrips demand, then the price will hover at a very comfortable region. But when at every point in time, the demand outstrips supply, the price will go up.\n\nAgain, the commodity comes into the country at a high cost. Sometime last year, a 20-metric-tonne truck was sold for N3.6m.\n\nAccording to him, the commodity has become expensive as the price is N5million and N6million.\n\nEssien called for full domestication of LPG in the country to prevent capital flight through importation of the commodity.\n\nNew Target Set For 2025\n\nWith the country failing to meet the 2020 target to end gas flaring, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, says the country is committed to a new target for the elimination of gas flaring.\n\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent. If you all recall, in 2020, the ministry of petroleum started what we call the National Gas Expansion Programme and we declared year 2020 as the year of gas,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this year, we also declared year 2021 the beginning of the gas decade. We believe that with all the programmes we have in place, we are on course to achieving complete elimination of gas flaring by 2025.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has made commitments to the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be part of the global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the government would be able to surmount the hurdles and achieve the new target to eliminate flaring by 2025.", "summary": "May 3, 2021 441To reverse the loss of potential revenue to gas flaring and capital flight due to regular importation of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) to meet domestic demand, the Nigerian government introduced the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP).\nThis is despite the plans and strategies deployed by the Nigerian government to put an end to the wasteful gas flaring in 2020.\nSpeaking at a public hearing on gas flaring at the House of Representatives in Abuja, the minister said the elimination of gas flaring was being taken seriously and would come to an end by 2025.\nHe noted that Nigeria has significantly reduced gas flaring, adding that initiatives had been deployed to ensure the utilisation of gas that is being flared.\n\u201cToday, we have actually reduced gas flaring significantly to a very minimal level of eight per cent.", "link": "https://bizwatchnigeria.ng/analysis-new-policy-fails-to-reverse-gas-flaring-importation/", "published": "05/03/2021", "scraped_date": "05/04/2021", "keywords": ["reverse", "importation", "fails", "cooking", "petroleum", "country", "gas", "2020", "oil", "nigerian", "nigeria", "target", "analysis", "policy", "flaring"]}

{"title": "Worsening Apapa Gridlock Amidst NPA Electronic Call-up System", "text": "April 29, 2021 500\n\nPort users, commuters and other motorists are currently groaning over the worsening gridlock on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway and along the Marine Bridge, Ijora, as trailers and tanker drivers have taken over these routes despite the implementation of the electronic call-up system by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Lagos State Government.\n\nThe e-call up system, which is being driven by an app known as eto, was designed by NPA to control movement of trucks to and from the port as part of efforts to address the Apapa gridlock. Under the system, all trucks are expected to vacate the roads and wait at designated parks until they are called into the ports when needed.\n\nHowever, two months into the implementation of the new system, there seems to be no end in sight to the intractable gridlock with NPA and Lagos State Government appearing helpless as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately on the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some truck drivers, due to the alleged slow process in booking of trucks by the Truck Transit Park (TTP), the company managing the eto application, have abandoned the designated parks to remain on the roads and bridges where they bribe their way into the port with fake e-call up slip in connivance with security personnel deployed to manage the gridlock.\n\nThe action by these truck drivers, coupled with the poor access roads and ongoing construction along the Mile Two-Tin Can Island Port road, has compounded the gridlock as motorists spent several hours trying to get into Apapa yesterday.\n\nAll the major roads into Apapa were completely taken over by trucks and petroleum tankers yesterday. The traffic stretched to other major highways including Eko Bridge and Ikorodu Road.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Directs NSCDC To Collaborate With Other Agencies To Prevent Attacks At Airports\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Stanley Ezenga, said there has not been any respite on the road despite the e-call up system, which he said has become a money-making venture for some people benefiting from the situation.\n\nHe said the traffic situation persists due to poor access roads and the failure of the government to prevail on the contractor handling the construction of the Apapa-Oshodi expressway to expedite action.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhy won\u2019t there be gridlock when the NPA electronic call up is just a nomenclature. The e call-up system is a money-making venture for NPA and some people are benefiting from it. For each call up, trucks pay N10,000 but this is just the official money. They still part with other money being given to security operatives before they get to the port.\n\n\u201cSo who is fooling who? From the onset, I know there will be issues with the e-call up because the main issue that has to do with the gridlock coupled with the state of the road has not been addressed. You can only come into Apapa through Wharf Road because the other road from Berger to Trinity is impassable.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Navy, created a task force but the gridlock has negated all of them.

{"title": "The Nigerian Telecom Sector Can Breathe Again", "text": "April 29, 2021 404\n\nA week is a week. This is almost true in every part of the world regardless of the season. Every week is also unique. The activities, the happenings, and the stories define each week.\n\n*This week has been epoch-making in every sense. This week, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd. The verdict was unanimous. He was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for over 9mins. George in pleading for his life kept saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Philonise Floyd, George\u2019s brother said that he\u2019s \u201cable to breathe again\u201d.\n\nThe feeling of relief was widespread. It was a sigh of relief heard around the world. We can all breathe again.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government lifted the ban on sales of SIM cards.\n\nOfficially, it meant that the telcos could resume sales of SIM cards after months of suspension. The sector and indeed Nigerian telecom services consumers were able to breathe again.\n\nDuring the ban, countless people who had lost their phones or damaged their SIM cards couldn\u2019t retrieve them. Visitors to the country couldn\u2019t get SIMs and businesses that depended on SIM card sales suffered. Millions were thrown out of jobs, sales outlets shut down and operators lost revenue. The last five months were a real chokehold on the telecommunications industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: Employment Statistics: World Bank, FG To Discuss Modalities Of Data Collection\n\nConservatives reports indicate that the number of connected lines dropped by over 10 million lines. Think, loss in revenue to the telecom services providers and endless pain for the customers who couldn\u2019t connect with family, friends, or business. It was a chokehold.\n\nNo wonder the sector couldn\u2019t breathe. Little wonder the economy recorded a rise in the number of unemployed and more citizens dropped into the poverty zone. The country couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nSince nature abhors a vacuum, it didn\u2019t take long for illegal sales of pre-registered SIMs to gain ground. This is a story for another week.\n\nThe biggest loss was that the objective was lost to all but the initiators. It was a chokehold on the economy, Nigerians couldn\u2019t breathe and nobody knew why.\n\nFirst, a little context. The Minister for Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, had in December 2020 ordered the suspension of the sales and activation of new SIM cards across all phone networks in the country. Through the NCC, he directed Nigerians to ensure that their phone lines were connected to their National Identification Numbers (NIN) or risk losing the lines.\n\nNow, the suspension was expected, at the time, to last till the completion of the NIN registration. The date fixed was early January.\n\nExperts swore that it was an impossible mission. For in a decade, the NIMC registered less than 50 million people, how can the same organization be reasonably expected to sign on over 50 million people in under six weeks? The experts were right.\n\nSo, it was no surprise therefore that the deadlines had to be shifted repeatedly. The humongous crowd at the registration centres made Nigerians criticised the government for not making adequate provisions before the directive went into effect.\n\nBanning SIM sales precipitated what appears to be several unintended consequences. The number of internet subscribers dropped, no doubt, limiting the chance of meeting the NCC set broadband target.\n\nIn these days of reducing average revenue per user (ARPU), it is a case of declining revenue for the operators.\n\nWhile telcos can\u2019t be expected to complain openly, the impact was an open wound. It was visible for all to see.\n\nThe pain is equally real. Job loss. Revenue loss.\n\nAt a time, when the economy is witnessing diminishing revenues, these losses also mean a reduction in taxes payable to the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nIt is difficult to reconcile the government\u2019s actions with its regulations. The situation is typical.
