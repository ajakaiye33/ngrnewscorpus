Effective security, effective information. There is no president who will want his country in chaos. Have you seen one? Point one to me. There is no one that will want his citizens exposed to banditry and danger.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no president or leader that will want his nation fractured by tribalism, religious differences and all that. It calls for serious management and serious evaluation and dialogue once in a while. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the agenda of his visit, he said, \u201cIt is to generally review the perceptions going on outside there and equally focus on the security across the country more. He will have more information than we have, but we are his ears close to the ground and we have to exchange views so that a better Nigeria is grounded. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nOn the best way forward, he replied, \u201cThe best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people. The welfare of our people is extremely important.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times. How we communicate it to the people, what are the areas to help make it easier for people to bear, those are ideas on how to be able to change the leadership of the country.\u201d\n\nFurther asked to comment on the insinuation that he has an unhealthy relationship with the President, the APC helmsman said his relationship with the President remains cordial.\n\nAccording to him,\u201dNothing like that, nothing like unhealthy (relationship with the President). Who, is our doctor? Is it social media that is measuring the relationship? I don\u2019t have to disturb him (Buhari) openly on camera, is it? No, we have so many ways to look at issues. We have nothing like that.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that his relationship is \u201cVery close and cordial, frank and honest.\u201d\n\nFielding question on the chances of the APC to return to power after the tenure of President Buhari in 2023, Asiwaju Tinubu said though he didn\u2019t want to predict what would happen then, the chances were bright.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to predict that one (chances of the APC retaining power at the centre after President Buhari) right now, I don\u2019t want to do that subject now. The chances are as bright as a midnight star. We will continue to work for a better Nigeria and that is what you need.\n\n\u201cWe cannot interject politics and assumption into everything, we have a nation to build, we have a baton to pass.

The support of important and strategic partners like United States cannot be overstated as the consequences of insecurity will affect all nations hence the imperative for concerted cooperation and collaboration of all nations to overcome these challenges\u201d.\n\nFlowing from this, the President stressed that the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) which partners with countries to counter transnational threats, should be relocated to Africa to strengthen ongoing efforts to check the security situation, with likely effect on other nations.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, and considering the growing security challenges in West and Central Africa, Gulf of Guinea, Lake Chad region and the Sahel, weighing heavily on Africa, it underscores the need for the United States to consider re-locating AFRICOM Headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany to Africa and near the Theatre of Operation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria will enhance collaborations in all forms, with friends and strategic partners, to work together for greater security for all, which remain the most significant condition for overcoming the existential challenges.\n\nPresident Buhari while congratulating Blinken on his appointment by President Joe Biden commended the United States for the decision to repeal the immigration restriction known as the \u201cMuslim ban\u2019\u2019, re-joining the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nHis words: \u201cNigeria attaches great importance to its relations with the United States.

{"title": "Nigerian lawmakers debate insecurity as senator says 42 Niger communities occupied by Boko Haram", "text": "Nigerian senators on Tuesday asked the leadership of the National Assembly to have a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari and brief him on the state of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThis was one of the many resolutions adopted by the lawmakers after deliberations on kidnappings and banditry across the nation.\n\nDuring the debate, a Niger State senator told his colleagues that 42 communities in the state were being occupied by Boko Haram.\n\nIn his contribution, Opeyemi Bamidele, a senator from Ekiti State, asked the Senate to \u201cmandate the leadership of the National Assembly to book an appointment with the Commander-In-Chief on behalf of the 109 senators\u2026because I\u2019m not convinced that Mr President is aware of everything that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026we need to be able to tell our constituents that we met with the commander-in-chief and this is what is being done,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bamidele was suggesting an addendum to the resolution on insecurity \u2013 which was adopted.\n\nThe lawmakers also resolved to invite the Chief of Army Staff, Ibrahim Attahiru, and heads of other security agencies for a meeting with the Senate.\n\nIn the same vein, the Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs and National Security were mandated to meet with the minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and the Director-General of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar, on the implications of the insecurity in Niger State.\n\nThe Debate\n\nThe resolutions were sequel to a motion on the activities of Boko Haram insurgents in Niger State. The motion was sponsored by Sani Musa (APC, Niger East).\n\nThe motion came barely 24 hours after the Niger State governor, Abubakar Bello, confirmed that Boko Haram has hoisted its flags in Kaure and Shiroro local government areas of the state \u2013 about 140km to the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nWhile he called for a more coordinated military action to fight the terrorists, Mr Bello warned that Kaure is less than two hours drive from Abuja and \u201cnobody is safe anymore, not even those in Abuja.\u201d\n\nLeading the debate on Tuesday, Mr Musa noted that the Senate has made several resolutions, set up an ad-hoc committee on security, appropriated budget and also advanced numerous steps to support Nigeria\u2019s security agencies.\n\nHe said the negative effects of the atrocities committed by the bandits include the total collapse of the local economies of the affected communities, the total collapse of the educational system, famine, displacement, depopulation, social vices, trauma arising from serial rape cases and inhumane, cruel and deadly subjugation.\n\n\u201cAbout 42 communities across the two local government areas of Shiroro and Munya Local Government have so far fallen under the Boko Haram control with about 5,000 villagers already displaced in the last three days.\n\n\u201cThey have kidnapped many and their wives seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members. Three military camps in Allawa, Bassa and Zagzaga in the two local government areas have been sacked and some security personnel killed by the insurgents in the last one month of renewed attacks.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram terrorists have mounted their flags in many of the villages they have captured such as Kaure, Alawa and Magami,\u201d he said.\n\nContributions\n\nLawmakers took turns to condemn the killings across the country. Over 15 senators made their contributions to the motion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported the worsening security situation across the country with over 200 people killed last week and over 44 others kidnapped.\n\nBima Enagi (APC, Niger North) said Nigerians cannot continue to bear the pain of women being raped and forcibly married to Boko Haram terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to allow Boko Haram to mount flags in Nigerian territories. What is our army doing? What are all security agencies doing? It has become so shameful that a great country like Nigeria will be in this type of terrible situation.\n\n\u201cIt seems the federal government is handling this insecurity situation with kid gloves. People are dying every day and nothing is being done. No serious, concrete situation on the ground to confront these people.\u201d\n\nIke Ekweremadu, an Enugu senator, warned that any government that cannot protect its citizens has lost legitimacy.\n\nHe also said Nigeria should not be ashamed to seek international support.\n\n\u201cTime has come for us to, if possible, shut down this senate and find a lasting solution to this,\u201d he said.\n\nBiodun Olujimi, an Ekiti senator, wondered why Nigeria recently sent out security officials for peacekeeping in another country when we cannot keep our own peace.\n\nThe bloodletting, she said, is out of hand.\n\n\u201cThere is lack of political will to handle insecurity. None of us here can say we know the process that this government is taking to handle insecurity.\n\n\u201cThere is also lack of leadership. New service chiefs have come. Have we told them what to do and given them a timeline?\u201d\n\nOther resolutions\n\nThe Senate, thereafter, called on the army chief and the Inspector General of Police to immediately deploy troops to defend the unarmed populace and bring back security to the affected communities.\n\nThey lawmakers called for a permanent military and police command base in the area adjoining Shiroro and Rafi local government areas respectively and to redesign the modus operandi of the military operations within the affected areas so as to curtail the escalating insecurity.\n\nThe lawmakers asked the president to order for massive recruitment of police officers and other security personnel.", "summary": "During the debate, a Niger State senator told his colleagues that 42 communities in the state were being occupied by Boko Haram.\nThe DebateThe resolutions were sequel to a motion on the activities of Boko Haram insurgents in Niger State.\n\u201cThey have kidnapped many and their wives seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.\n\u201cBoko Haram terrorists have mounted their flags in many of the villages they have captured such as Kaure, Alawa and Magami,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe cannot continue to allow Boko Haram to mount flags in Nigerian territories.", "link": "https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/457884-nigerian-lawmakers-debate-insecurity-as-senator-says-42-niger-communities-occupied-by-boko-haram.html", "published": "04/27/2021", "run": "04/27/2021", "keywords": ["haram", "niger", "insecurity", "local", "nigerian", "senator", "boko", "areas", "state", "debate", "security", "communities", "occupied", "lawmakers", "senate"]}
