Court remands 4 men for allegedly burning Obasanjo’s mango farm,"A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi on Friday ordered the remand of four men in a correctional centre for allegedly conspiring and burning a Mango farm belonging to former President Olusegun Obasanjo.



The suspects: Julius Igyo, Samuel Aleva, Pius Mcha and Daniel Ortserga, are all of Howe town in Gwer-East Local Government Area of Benue.



They were charged with criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation, criminal trespass, mischief by fire and act of terrorism.



The Chief Magistrate, Mr Vincent Kor, did not take the plea of the suspects for want of jurisdiction and adjourned the matter until March 28 for further mention.



Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Ato, told the court that on Jan. 31, the Manager of the farm, Mr Suberu Mohammed, reported the incident to the Commissioner of Police in Benue.



Ato said the manager said that on Jan. 29, he received a phone call from his assistant, Gowon Tarkev, that fire had engulfed the farm.



He stated further that when he rushed to the farm, he discovered that fire had burnt down 90 hectares of the farm comprising 18,360 mango trees valued at N183.6 million.

The manager in his statement accused the suspects, Asande Ishor, Uger Jarpes, Moses Torchie and many others from Howe of being responsible for the incident.



He also said that the suspects earlier demanded for compensation over the land where the mango trees were planted.



Mohammed said that the suspects and their accomplices had terrorised them in the farm by beating them, threatening their lives and cutting down the mango trees.



The prosecutor said the suspects were arrested during police investigation while others were still at large.



He said the offences contravened the provisions of sections 97, 398, 349 and 338 of the Penal Code, Laws of Benue, 2004.

Court voids suit seeking removal of Ekiti Varsity VC,"A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Friday, rejected a suit seeking to invalidate the appointment of Prof. Abayomi Fasina as the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE).

Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, ruled that the plaintiff, Tableland Society For the Oppressed (TSFO), lacked the legal right to institute the suit.

Justice Ekwo further held that plaintiff failed to establish that it was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to engage in public interest litigation and question the activities of government’s agencies.

The judge, who upheld the defendants’ preliminary objection, denied jurisdiction over the case.

He, thereafter, struck out the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/250/2021.

Listed as defendants in the suit are the Minister of Education; the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; the Chairman of FUOYE’s Governing Council; the institution’s Registrar; the Chairman, National University Commission and Prof. Fasina.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that TSFO had argued that Fasina was not qualified for the appointment having allegedly been indicted for wrong doing and having also not done well in the interview during the selection process.

It accused the university’s Governing Council of manipulating selection process to favour Fashina.

The plaintiff prayed the court to, among others, void Fasina’s appointment and order the conduct of fresh appointment process.

The group stated that “the 6th defendant (Fasina) was indicted by the committee set up by Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, for collecting double salary from both Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti and Federal University Oye-Ekiti.

“Section 42 of the Constitution has been violated by the appointment of the 6th defendant, who failed the selection interview organised.

“The defendants have all endorsed and unjustly conferred the position of the Vice Chancellor on the 6th defendant who is not qualified at the expense of qualified candidates purely on the basis of discrimination.

Fuel Scarcity: Adulterated fuel damages our vehicles – RTEAN,"Alhaji Olayinka Onikijipa, the Chairman of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) in Kwara, has said that the adulterated fuel in circulation has damaged some of their vehicles.

Onikijipa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Friday that the fuel scarcity had given some unpatriotic people the opportunity to exploit Nigerians.

“This is a very sad situation we have found ourselves; the adulterated fuel in circulation has damaged two of our vehicles.

“I think many more were damaged, but have not been reported officially to the association. This situation has brought back memories of bad governance in our nation.

“We spend the whole day at the fuel station, yet still buying adulterated fuel, it has affected our business negatively,” he said.

He, however, called on the government to be proactive and ensure that regulatory bodies were up to the task of protecting citizens and their interests.

The chairman said interstate transportation fare had not increased, but they may be forced to increase it, if the scarcity persisted.

“Transportation fare remains the same for now, but if scarcity persists, I do not know what can happen.

“Some bad people have capitalised on the situation to exploit Nigerians because people are complaining of buying fuel above the pump price where it is available.

“This is bad; we do not have to inconvenience ourselves. We should all have the love of this nation at heart.

“The government should be more proactive in their responsibilities to the citizens.

“And I want to advise those hoarding fuel in their vehicles, home and shops to stop the practice; it can wreak havoc at any time.

Battle over APC convention: PMP Presidential candidate pushes hard to clinch APC secretary,"…Senator Osita Izunaso struggles

…Uzodimma silence causes confusion – Stakeholders

By Chinonso Alozie

The 2011 presidential candidate of the Peoples Mandate Party, PMP, Batos Nwadike, and Special Adviser on political affairs to Imo governor, Hope Uzodimma, has not relented in his move to grab the position of the National Secretary of the APC, ahead of the APC National convention on 26 February 2022.

Vanguard gathered that Nwadike has set up his campaign team, which happened on Friday in Abuja.

But Nwadike has remained silent on whether he has the full backing of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma, in this political journey.

In another move, Senator Osita Izunaso has been making such a move to becoming the next National Secretary of APC.

But the two camps of Nwadike, and Senator Izunaso, have been in a long race to edge each other out of the contest as well as get the endorsement

of the key players at the convention.

Vanguard gathered from some of the APC, stakeholders, who pleaded not to mention their names said: “The silence of the governor can confuse the party. He should be able to call his children together so that they will not go to the convention with divided minds.

“Maybe the governor will do that at the last minute. That is what he’s waiting for. We think that his intervention will reduce the level of acrimony and spending of resources by those aspiring to that position from the Imo APC, chapter.

“Another thing is that has the APC, agreed to zone the position to the South East? Let us not go and waste our resources in this battle. Let us be careful.

“Another thing worrisome with the way the convention arrangement is going on will the convention still hold on that 26 February, that is another issue. But let us keep watching.”","But Nwadike has remained silent on whether he has the full backing of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma, in this political journey.

Amotekun: Arewa youths caution Ondo Governor over alleged harassment of northerners,"The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYCF) on Friday, cautioned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to end the constant harassment of northerners in the state by the Amotekun security outfit.

A statement signed by the Forum’s National President, Yerima Shettima alleged that on many occasions, Amotekun corps personnel have picked up and harassed northerners in the state for just no cause.

The statement said the existence of SSS, the Army, Amotekun, NSCDC and other security personnel is to protect lives and properties and not to harass residents

It added that the Amotekun Corps which is state-owned should not be used arbitrarily against the few northerners in the state, who are just going about their legitimate businesses.

The statement informed the governor that, as northerners are in the state for their legitimate businesses, so also, there are westerners spread across the northern parts of the country.

Shettima added that, if the same unnecessary maltreatment, hatred and harassment is meted out to them, there will be no peace in the country.

It warned that, if the government of Ondo State allows such intimidation and harassment to continue, without justification, it would mean that he does not want northerners in his state.","The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYCF) on Friday, cautioned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to end the constant harassment of northerners in the state by the Amotekun security outfit.

NULGE alerts Soludo of alleged subletting of Anambra’s revenue windows to politicians,"Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has raised alarm over the alleged sublet of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo had recently threatened to revoke all revenue windows allocated to politicians, through an executive order on the morning of his swearing-in.

NULGE on Friday claimed it has information that the state revenue board was allocating revenue windows to their cronies, with the intent to hijack the state’s resources, especially as the Governor Willie Obiano administration winds down.

The state president of the group, Mr Chikwelu Adigwe who briefed members of the union at the state secretariat of the union in Awka said most of the revenue windows being sold out belong to the local government areas.

The president also protested the highjacking of most revenues being collected by the local government councils, thereby rendering them useless.

“The condition of our service is no longer acceptable to us, so we want to make our voices heard.

“We are doing all we can during this transition period to ensure that the right things are done. We have written to the transition committee, we have also written to the assembly to complain about the continuous confirmation of transition committee chairmen, instead of holding local government elections.

“Right now, we have it on good authority that the state revenue board is still allocating revenue windows to politicians, and we want to warn the governor-elect about this.

“We are here today to complain about the way the system is running. The system was not like this when we came into the service. Things have gone so bad.

“When we were in school, we heard that there were three tiers of government, but gradually, the local government has been rendered redundant and inexistent. Our job is gradually being taken away by the state, but we will not allow this to continue.”

The union said it has resolved to take back all revenue windows belonging to it, including stallage fees, wheelbarrow levies, liquor licenses and many others, which have been taken from them by the state government.

The union also urged Soludo to ensure the conduct of local government elections within three months of his swearing-in, ensure the reconstitution of the Local Government Service Commission to include local government workers, instead of an all-politicians affairs, among others.

“We have charged our members to go out and collect revenues due to their various local government councils. Any shop owner who pays revenue touts should be ready to pay twice. We are not preaching war here, but we will not run away from war,” Adigwe said.","Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has raised alarm over the alleged sublet of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Abuja court strikes out suit seeking Federal University Vice Chancellor’s sack,"A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday struck out a suit seeking to void the appointment of Professor Abayomi Sunday Fasina as the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) in Ekiti state.

Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo, in a judgment, held that the plaintiff – Tableland Society For the Oppressed (TSFO) – lacked the locus standi to institute the suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/250/2021.

Justice Ekwo further held that the plaintiff failed to establish that it was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to engage in public interest litigation and question the activities of government’s agencies.

The judge, who upheld the defendants’ preliminary objection, denied jurisdiction over the case and proceeded to strike it out.

Listed as defendants in the suit are the Minister of Education, the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; the Chairman of FUOYE’s Governing Council; the institution’s Registrar; the Chairman, National University Commission and Prof. Fasina.

TSFO had argued among others that Fasina was not qualified for the appointment having allegedly been indicted for wrongdoing and having also not done well in the interview during the selection process.

It accused the university’s Governing Council of manipulating the selection process to favour Fashina.

Gunmen attack Okomu Oil Palm Company to avenge arrest of two suspects – Olise,"From Tony Osauzo, Benin

Gunmen on Thursday, reportedly attacked Okomu Oil Palm Company in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State, barely a day after two suspects were paraded by the State Police Command over their involvement in a February 1 attack in which two staff killed and 90 hectares of the Company’s rubber estate and three excavators were burnt.

The Company’s Communication officer, Fidelis Olise, who disclosed this yesterday, said the gunmen had earlier carried out attack on Tuesday, making it two attacks in the three days.

Describing the gunmen as terrorists, Olise said they carried out the latest attacks in retaliation of the arrest of two of their supposed members.

“The same terrorists, seemingly angered by the arrest of two of their supposed members carried out further attacks on innocent workers on the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s property to avenge the arrest of their accomplices who apparently confessed to the theft of rubber. They were arrested by the Marine Police on a boat after it had left the Okomu Ijaw Community on its way to Delta State.

“The killing of innocent workers who are performing their legitimate duties and have no conflict or disagreement with any person is strongly condemned and the powers that be should immediately take action against those terrorists responsible for these murderous crimes.

“Attacks on companies like Okomu, are also a serious note for concern as it seems that terrorists are now focusing on these types of establishments, intent on bringing them to their knees, and in so doing creating an environment that could show the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led Government as weak. It also poses a great threat to current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria as a whole, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the Buhari administrations.

“The time has come for the Buhari and Obaseki administrations to take concerted and decisive actions against these terrorists, otherwise investment in the agricultural sector will be greatly discouraged just as was the case with pipeline vandalization in the past, with the resultant negative effect on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both state and federal government coffers.

“The Police must immediately undertake a thorough investigation and bring all those linked to the heinous attacks to book, thereby showing that they are a force to be reckoned with, and reinstating confidence in their ability to fight crime. The army too should be deployed to ensure that this area of Ovia South West Local Government Area is safe for all, while terrorists and cultists are rooted from this area for good”, the Okomu Oil Palm Company further stated.","The Company’s Communication officer, Fidelis Olise, who disclosed this yesterday, said the gunmen had earlier carried out attack on Tuesday, making it two attacks in the three days.

"Transport fare skyrockets, commuters stranded as fuel queues persist","From Uche Usim, Abuja

The price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol hit N700 per litre in Abuja, yesterday, even as residents have described the protracted scarcity as a worse-than-hell-experience.

From Kubwa to Wuse, Maitama to Asokoro, most of the filling stations had ran out of fuel while the few that sold had long queues. At bus stops, scores of commuters were stranded as fewer commercial vehicles plied the roads.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The scarcity also forced Bolt and Uber hailing cabs to cancel their booking even as transport fares rose significantly due to demand outpacing supply. Cost of transport from Kubwa to Wuse jumped from N200 to N350.

A taxi driver, David Adams, told Daily Sun that most filling stations preferred to sell between midnight and 4am to enable them sell at black market rates.

“I bought petrol somewhere in Zone 4 around 3am. I slept there actually. The situation is worse than last week,” he said.

Marcus Anaga, another taxi driver said: “Right now, we call each other to know the filling station to go and sleep to get petrol.”

Other residents who spoke with Daily Sun regretted that the scarcity has disrupted economic and social activities and made the FCT chaotic. They queried why the scarcity has persisted despite assurances from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), oil marketers and other stakeholders that the trend would ease.

They also queried the veracity of NNPC’s claims of injecting 3.2 billion litres of petrol into the domestic market saying rather than have petrol to buy, filling stations in the FCT were either empty or flooded with thousands of frustrated consumers queuing endlessly to buy petrol.

It was observed that black market price of petrol that was hitherto N400 per litre earlier in the week had jumped to N700 even as motorists were forced to part with N500 tip for a jerrycan before petrol attendants were allowed to sell to them.

A black market dealer who identified himself as Aliyu said: “I buy petrol for N300 a litre from the pump and sell at N700 per litre. I’m making good sales. The scarcity is good.”

Mohammed, another black market operator, said products were available as from midnight.

“I buy at night, around 2am. When day breaks, I sell to rich men and women who don’t have time to queue at filling stations. I sell 10 litres for N6,500.”

Daily Sun observed that most of the petrol tankers have been parked at various filling stations for days without product to discharge.

The scarcity has badly impacted small and medium enterprises who rely on petrol generators to run their businesses.

Some supermarket owners in Abuja lamented that frozen foods in their freezers were defrosting and losing freshness due to lack of petrol to power their generators.

“Diesel is now N400 per litre, petrol price is worse, electricity is not stable. I dare not refuse to run my diesel and petrol generators if I want to remain in business. The chicken and ice cream sections are delicate. They can easily melt and decay. This is hell,” Mrs Ajani of CKD Supermarket in Kubwa lamented.","From Kubwa to Wuse, Maitama to Asokoro, most of the filling stations had ran out of fuel while the few that sold had long queues.

"365 Days to Presidential Election, the Aspirants are Emerging","Obinna Chima and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

Today makes it exactly a year to the 2023 presidential election and aspirants in the two main political parties – the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) – as well as some other parties, are positioning for the most coveted office in the land. They have started to throw their hats in the ring to indicate their interest.

Even though the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has yet to blow the whistle to signal the start of electioneering, the political space is buzzing with the activities of potential aspirants who have started doing the leg work early – meeting critical stakeholders in an effort to sell their aspiration and win critical endorsement.

Although about 11 individuals from diverse backgrounds have formally declared their intentions to vie for their party’s ticket, many of the big names being touted as nursing presidential ambitions are yet to make a formal announcement even though their footprints are all over the political space. Every occasion, official or unofficial is now a rally of sort with political undertone.

In the next few months the political space is expected to be crowded with the big names currently holding consultations in secret and in not so secret places – finally coming out to formally make their pitch.

Here are those who have declared so far.

Bola Tinubu

Since the former Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his desire to succeed him, he has been busy moving round the country and consulting with different interest groups and individuals. Already, groups such as SWAGA, the acronym for “South-West Agenda for Asiwaju,” populated by Tinubu’s acolytes and yes men, are already touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature.

Sam Ohuabunwa

The immediate past president of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, has declared to contest the position of the President in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ohuabunwa who had lamented worsening socio-economic and political conditions in the country, strongly believes he has what it takes to transform Nigeria. He said the greatest challenge that propelled his presidential ambition was the need to produce a new Nigeria where injustice is ruled out.

Anyim Pius Anyim

The former Senate President, and one time Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Anyim has declared his interest in the presidential race. He feels it was time for someone from the South-east to lead the country and has vowed to contest, whether the presidential slot is zoned to his zone or not. He strongly believes the next president should be able to rebuild, protect lives and property, revive the economy, create jobs and rehabilitate the collapsed educational system. According to him, the task ahead called for a candidate who possesses the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the PDP to accomplish the tasks. He believes he has what it takes to govern the country, particularly in these trying times.

Dele Momodu

Dele Momodu last month declared his presidential ambition in his hometown, Ihevbe, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State. According to the journalist and publisher of Ovation International magazine, he remains the most qualified among those aspiring to take over from Buhari next year. He insists that he might not have been a governor, senator, minister but he has sat with the high and mighty, adding that he’s qualified to become the president of the country.

Kingsley Moghalu

A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu has also declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Moghalu had said his decision to contest again for president was driven by concern for suffering Nigerians who seek an alternative to the status quo. The former CBN deputy governor contested the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in 2019 and has since moved to the African Democratic Congress (ADC).

Chukwuka Monye

43-year-old technocrat, Chukwuka Monye, in January, said the time to take over the governance from the older generation is now. To this end, the Delta State-born social innovator has declared his intention to contest for the president in the 2023 general elections. Monye whose slogan is “our future is now” wondered how the founding fathers would be content with Nigeria’s current state. Monye, is however, yet to state the party platform which he intends to contest.

Rochas Okorocha

The Imo West senator, Rochas Okorocha, recently made known his interest to contest for the office of the president in the 2023 general elections. In a letter to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, dated January 25, the former Imo State governor said what Nigeria needs right now is someone who is “detribalised” and can unite the country. This would be the third consecutive time the politician who claims to have built several schools for under-privileged Nigerians across the country would be throwing his hat in the ring.

Aminu Tambuwal

Aminu Tambuwal, is the current Sokoto state governor. The politician would be seeking to realise his ambition under the Peoples Democratic Party. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who declared his intention after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Sokoto, recently, said that he is not only well prepared but also ready to fix the numerous problems of the country. Generally perceived as urbane, Tambuwal will face off against other contenders in the opposition party during the party’s convention.

David Umahi

The present Ebonyi State Governor , David Umahi, declared his 2023 presidential ambition at the State House, in Abuja, coming about 24 hours after former Governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, also indicated an interest in the race. Both men are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi, speaking at a press briefing after meeting with Buhari, said his presidency will replicate his “progressive efforts” in Ebonyi at the national level. The Chairman of the South-east Governors’ Forum said he intends to bring a business-like spirit to governance, claiming that Buhari responded to his interest by asking him to seek the support of the people when he met with him to intimate the president of his intention.

Yahaya Bello

The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was one of the earliest Nigerians to have shown interest to aspire for the 2023 presidency under the banner of the ruling APC. Bello, however opened up in Bauchi, while addressing APC legislators as well as women groups from the North-east during an extraordinary meeting held in Bauchi at Hazibal hotel sometime ago.

The Kogi governor who has always touted his youthful age as an advantage, has described the task ahead as an enormous one.

Sani Yerima

The ex-Zamfara governor, Sani Yerima, has also declared his intention to govern the country. The politician while speaking during a BBC Hausa Service programme “Gane Mani Hanya” monitored in Gusau, said since Buhari is ending his second term, he (Yerima) would continue to pursue his presidential ambition.

“If God spares my life, by 2023 I would go into the contest for the post of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ” Yerima said.

Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi

An entrepreneur and youth development advocate, the young Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi, has promised to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace if given the platform to do so. She promised to harness the power of Nigerian teeming youths to unleash the country’s latent potential, which she described as a force to be reckoned with globally. She is the daughter of former Federal Commissioner of Works and Housing, Lateef Femi Okunnu (SAN).

Some of Those Yet to Declare…

Yemi Osinbajo

With the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, there are expectations that he would declare his interest in the coming days. Osinbajo clearly comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but appears to be keeping his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much. However, Nigerians are watching to see how Osinbajo would go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Tinubu, to actualise his ambition.

Atiku Abubakar

Despite the seeming opposition against his candidature, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023. Atiku’s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023. While some interest groups recently advised the former vice president not to contest and have labelled him the serial presidential aspirant, Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.

Godwin Emefiele

There has been an increasing call for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to join the presidential race. A technocrat with alluring pedigree – No doubt a breath of fresh in the political arena. Although Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone that he is running for president even as he is constitutionally qualified to so do, he has said he remains focused on his job and would continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government’s economic recovery drive. Emefiele also believes it’s the prerogative of President Buhari to plan his succession for the continuing peace and progress of Nigeria.

Bukola Saraki

The former Governor of Kwara State has not held any elaborate event to declare his ambition, but he has hinted on several occasions on his active Twitter and Facebook accounts, that he would likely be running for the most-sought-after position. On one occasion recently, the former President of the Senate, relayed an encounter with a follower on Twitter, who charged him to run and in his response, hinted at the possibility.

“Earlier, I replied to a follower of mine on Twitter, who like thousands of you, has been clamouring for a united front to #RescueNigeria. As we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us,” he had said.

Rotimi Amaechi

Even though former Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi has not declared his intention, some interest groups in the country have been nudging him to throw his hat in the battle to succeed the president. Some believe that at 56, Amaechi does not have the burden of old age-related health challenges associated with some aspirants. Many people have linked the 2023 presidency to his recent coronation as: Dan Amanah Daura, which translates to mean the ‘Trusted son of Daura.’

Bala Mohammed

Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed has said he is likely to run for president in the 2023 election under the PDP. Presently, he is consulting with stakeholders across the country and recently met with former president Goodluck Jonathan.

Nigeria Set for 5G Rollout as FG Releases Spectrum Allocation,"•NCC to licence operators after February 27

Emma Okonji in Lagos and Oghenevwede Ohwovoriole in Abuja

The federal government yesterday in Abuja, officially handed over Spectrum Allocation for 5G deployment to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who doubles as the Chairman of the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), did the official handover of the Spectrum Allocation for 5G licence to the NCC during a workshop on the National Policy on 5G Networks and handover of Spectrum Allocation for deployment, in Abuja.

Aside the official handover of the 5G spectrum to the NCC, the Minister also did an official public handover of the National Policy on 5G Network for Nigeria’s Digital Economy to the NCC.

Based on the official handover of the 5G spectrum, the NCC was expected to licence winners of the 5G spectrum after February 27, when it must have given full update of the payment of the licence fees by the winners, to enable 5G network rollout in the country.

NCC was expected to make formal announcement on the update of payment for 5G licence on February 27, 2022, in line with the Information Memorandum for 3.5GHz spectrum, which is the 5G licence spectrum.

The Commission had on December 13, 2021, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, successfully auctioned two slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum band to MTN Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, at a bid price of $273.6 million for each operator.

The successful auction of the 3.5GHz spectrum band would pave way for the issuance of a fifth generation (5G) licence that would facilitate the deployment of 5G network across Nigeria.

After the successful auction of the spectrum, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, had announced that the winners were expected to make payment for the spectrum license, on or before February 24, 2022, to enable them roll out the 5G network across the country.

Before the successful spectrum auction in December last year, the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), was occupying five slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum, but vacated two slots, which were handed over to the National Frequency Management Council, chaired by the Minister.

Pantami advised state governors to look beyond the money they would collect from network operators who will deploy the 5G in their states, but see the gain that its deployment would bring to their respective states and the Nigerian economy in general.

Pantami said, “The issue of right of way becomes a challenge from time to time. The government has addressed the issue more than ninety per cent but from time to time issues may come. I do hope that they will understand the economic benefit. The security benefits and many more of these technological advancement.

“It is beyond right of way charges. It goes beyond that. So let us try to make the process very easy for operators so that they will be able to deploy 5G.”

He added that the adoption of 5G technologies and its roll out would support in the development of Nigeria’s digital economy

“5G will provide very fast and reliable communication for our security personnel and allow then to swiftly access relevant data required to carry out their duties. The time required to access data for records from hours minutes.

“5G will allow for real time high quality and data intensive surveillance of relevant areas using high definition cameras.

“Emerging technologies like Blockchain can significantly improve transparency to the delivery of government services at all levels.

“The World Economic Forum attests to the potential of Blockchain to increase the efficiency and fairness of government system and by extension limit opportunities for corruption.

It can significantly improve transparency in procurement procedures enhance land and registry system, ensure that government documents are not accessed by unauthorised personal,” he stressed

The minister also spoke on the national policy on 5G deployment in the country, saying, “the National Policy for 5G diploma in Nigeria for our country’s digital economy is also going to be distributed after the luncheon we use the occasion for the public presentation of the policy and we encourage our stakeholders to look into it and ensure a very successful implementation of the policy on what we had been doing.

“According to February 2021 report by Accentuate, 5G-enabled factories can see up to 2O-30 per cent in overall productivity gains including improvement of 50 per cent in assemble time.

These are only a few examples to show how 5G can have a positive impact on our economy,” he added.

In his contribution, Danbatta said: “On the 25th January, 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari, unveiled the National Policy on 5G Networks at the Presidential Villa.

“This singular action triggered today’s event – the presentation of the 5G policy to the general public and for our critical stakeholders to officially witness the National Frequency Management Council presenting the Spectrum allocated for 5G technology to the Nigerian Communications Commission. To all members of the National Frequency Management Council, your efforts are truly appreciated and your recommendations have been immensely helpful.”

Former Secretary General and Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) and CEO of Tetconsult, UK and Nigeria, Shola Taylor, who presented the lead paper on the benefits of 5G deployment in Nigeria, said: “5G is a reality and the impact on our lives is real and the benefits are endless. Nigeria is already in it. We have started well and must be prepared for the disruption that will come in spite of the challenges. We cannot go back. We cannot remain where we are so the only option is to move forward and move quickly.”

Giving details about 5G network, Taylor said 5G would continue to be attractive and revolutionary in nation building because it offers lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth. “This means higher data speeds, faster connections for use by individuals and businesses,” Taylor added.

The Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Aziz, said the success of the implementation of the policy would largely depend of good collaboration between all stakeholders in the country.

Also, the Director General Galaxy Back Bone, Prof. Mohammed Abubarka, said the deployment of 5G and the implementation of the nation’s digital policy would help to achieve President Buhari’s government’s transparency and boost the economy.

"Emefiele: CBN Passionate about Youth Empowerment, Economic Restructuring","Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba

Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has expressed commitment to various programmes targeted at youth empowerment and restructuring of the Nigerian economy in order to move it away from its over-dependence on oil revenue.

The CBN governor who made the remarks at a two-day CBN Fair, which opened in Asaba yesterday, said he was passionate about empowering youths, especially young graduates through various initiatives to support small and medium scale enterprises as well as agricultural support schemes.

He noted that the unprecedented rice pyramid witnessed in Abuja, recently and the over 160 per cent rise in the number of rice mills in the country was an evidence that the CBN’s intervention in agriculture sector was yielding fruits.

Similarly, he said the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) of the apex bank and other development finance interventions greatly helped in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through the various palliatives that Nigerians benefited from.

He stressed the need for all hands to be on the deck to tackle the economic challenges facing Nigeria.

The Corporate Communications Director, CBN, Mr. Osita Nwanisoba, who represented Emiefele, at the fair, noted that growing a diversified economy that would meet contemporary challenges in a sustainable manner underscored the intervention programmes of the apex bank.

He stressed the need for Nigerians to understand the history of their economy and to know how they could key into the numerous intervention programmes and schemes designed to restructure the country’s economic base from its monoculture status.

He assured that the CBN has been consistently proactive in ensuring that its initiatives were in tune with global trends, including digitalisation and smart internet innovations in the financial world.

He said the fact that Nigeria was the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency, the e-Naira on October 26, 2021, testified to the proactive state of the CBN.

He said, “First and foremost, it is important for us to know where we are coming from and where we are going, because the understanding of the past will help us to understand why the CBN is doing what it is doing. Like I said, Nigeria is a mono-product economy; mono-product because 90 per cent of our foreign exchange (FX) revenue come from oil and about 60 per cent of our expenditure also comes from oil. What this means is that whenever there is a shock out there it immediately translates to our economy.

“So, it becomes even more problematic for the CBN to be able to deal with its mandate. And, we have a clear mandate, which we understand, but we feel that to be able to actualise this mandate, there are other things we need to do, and that is, to stimulate growth, to grow the economy in a sustainable manner.

“What the CBN is doing is to diversify the economic base of this country. We are saying that there are so many and so much that we can do. We have agriculture, we have manufacturing. So, why can we deal with these things so that we will be able to produce what we eat and eat what we produce?

“Basically, that is why the CBN is intervening in the critical sectors of the economy. These are sectors that would grow the economy, create jobs, ensure that there is export so that we will be able to moderate our exchange rate and earn even more FX and grow our external reserves.”

On the significance of the e-Naira to the central bank’s efforts to restructure the economy, the representative of the CBN governor said there was need to move the country in the direction other economies were going.

“I think the first thing we have to understand is that we are gradually moving into what I will call the knowledge economy. We have also seen what digitalisation is doing across the world. Like I said earlier, as countries begin to move away from more fossil fuel to digital economy, it becomes imperative that you need to be at pace with what is going on.

“Today, we to talk about a web economy, we talk about internet economy, we talk about quantum computing and the rest of them.

“So, Nigeria felt that we needed to deal with this, leveraging on the sophisticated payment infrastructure that we have and launched its own digital currency. It is the first in Africa. It’s quite phenomenal. I think it is the sixth in the world.”

“Recently, we launched the TIES – the Tertiary Institution Entrepreneurship Scheme – the whole essence is to empower the youths so that they will unleash their productive potentials.

“Therefore, some of the takeaways from this fair is that the CBN is a listening institution. Like the CBN Governor always say, that he wants a people-centred central bank. Two, to understand that there are interventions of the CBN and to know how to leverage these interventions.”

"Power Supply: FG Targets 27,000 Homes, Signs €9.3m Deal for Provision of 23-Mini-grids Nationwide","Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

The federal government has signed an Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme (IMAS) deal with eight indigenous solar mini-grid developers for the establishment of 23 mini-grids across 11 states of the country.

Expected to generate a 5.4-kilowatt peak to connect about 27,600 households, and impact over 138,000 Nigerians in two years, the €9.3 million project is being coordinated by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) with support from the European Union and the German government.

At the award signing ceremony, the Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, said the programme was geared towards achieving the country’s vision of generating at least 30, 000 megawatts of electricity by 2030.

Jedy-Agba noted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was always open to opportunities that would achieve the acceleration of electricity in Nigeria.

According to him, the national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, vision 30:30:30 aim at achieving 30,000 megawatts of electricity by the year 2030, with renewable energy contributing 30 per cent of the energy mix. To achieve this, the minister stated that Nigeria would have to construct over a thousand mini-grids of 100 kilowatts.

The minister added that it was important to continue to find creative and innovative ways to achieve the objective, and one of which was through collaborating with development partners and the private sector.

He added: “We understand that one of the major bottlenecks for the private sector’s involvement is financing, hence, the reason the NESP and REA have worked closely to develop and implement the scheme.”

The eight local solar mini-grid developers include Acob Lighting Technology Limited, Gve Projects, Nayo Tropical Technology Limited, Rubitec Nigeria Limited and Darway Coast Nigeria Limited, Synergy Limited, Sosa-Protergia Joint Development Company Limited, and A4&T Power Solutions Limited.

They would receive in-kind grants through the REA with support of the European Union and the German Government within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).

The indigenous developers are expected to establish 23 mini-grids across 11 states, which include, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Anambra, and Cross River.

Earlier, the Managing Director of REA, Ahmad Salihijo said the scheme was aimed at bridging the funding gap affecting indigenous developers in the renewable energy sector.

“It is our hope that the signatures we put down today in these documents set a precedent for the new and improved power and energy sector in Nigeria.

“As an agency, we encourage investors to explore the solar mini-grid sector. However, one major constraint to this is usually financing. This is why the REA, with the support of NESP, is working together to alleviate this bottleneck.

“We do this by providing in-kind grants to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,” he stressed.

According to him, the main objective of the intervention is to design and test a tender model for interconnected solar mini-grids, leading to the foundation of the scheme.

“The wonderful thing about the IMAS project is that we have ensured that all the developers are Nigerians. This is to say that the Nigerian energy sector has come a long way from what it used to be and we are proud of this,” he explained.

Head of programme, NESP, Benjamin Duke, assured that his team would continue to work to build investors’ confidence in the sector by developing an accurate electricity market intelligence that will provide investors with accurate data about the country’s electricity needs.

Also speaking at the ceremony, the Executive Director, Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Sanusi Ohiare, said while investors were being encouraged to explore the solar mini-grid sector, one major constraint to their project development was finance.

“Hence, the REA with the support of NESP was able to alleviate this major burden by providing capital in-kind grant to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,” he noted.

Head of Section, Green Economy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Inga Stefanowicz, noted that the EU’s financial support for the programme represents the EU’s commitment to support Nigeria in the efforts to enable more investments in the solar mini-grid sector.

“We hope that our contribution will help improve access to reliable and affordable electricity in Nigeria, especially in the disadvantaged areas of the country, hence advancing the living standard of the rural and peri-urban dwellers using renewable sources of energy,” she stated.

Country Director of GIZ Nigeria & ECOWAS, Ina Hommers, said the provision of capital in-kind grants to the developers in the solar mini-grid sector through the IMAS aimed to ensure higher investments in the sector.

“Therefore, the grants contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria, in particular SDG 7 on access to affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. These represent one of the focal areas of GIZ’s support to Nigeria,” Hommers stressed.

Depending on the ability of the private sector, between 18 to 24 solar mini-grid projects will be deployed in 2022 under the project, serving clean electricity to around 138,000 people in Nigeria.

"Nigerian Air Force, Customs Partner To Secure Borders, Tackle Banditry, Smuggling, Others","The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to partner in order to strengthen border security and stem the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points.

NAF spokesperson Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet disclosed this in a statement on Thursday.

According to the Gabkwet, the air force is expected to make available on request 2 of its pilots to assist with the operation of NCS Bell-427 helicopters.

The statement read, “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to synergize their efforts towards strengthening border security and stemming the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points. To this end, the NAF is expected to make available on request 2 of its pilots to assist with the operation of NCS Bell-427 helicopters and by so doing complement the manpower of NCS Air-Wing.

“This information is part of the content of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently consummated between both organizations. The MoU specifically sets out the terms of a joint commitment, which is expected to enhance efficiency in the areas of port and border patrols to curtail activities of smuggling syndicates across the country.”

Speaking at the event, which was held at the NCS Headquarters, Abuja, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, who was represented by the Director of Operations, Headquarters NAF, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Nnamdi Ananaba stated that the NAF will continue to encourage partnership with other security agencies as well as provide aircraft maintenance support so as to enhance the fight against all forms of insecurity in the country.

He added that the NAF partnership with the NCS was a clear indication of the need for synergy and inter-agency cooperation, particularly between military and para-military organizations.

“The MoU will go a long way in building on the already existing cordial and cooperative relationship as well as ensure seamless collaboration between our organizations,” he said.

Air Vice-Marshal Ananaba went on to note that the current security challenges in the country call for the need to bridge the gap and divide that disconnects the military and other government agencies in order to work towards achieving a common goal.

The Comptroller General of NCS, Colonel Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd), in his remarks, noted that the partnership with the NAF will no doubt improve NCS’ air operations and anti-smuggling efforts particularly as it intensifies efforts in checkmating small arms proliferation across the country.

Ali also thanked the CAS for offering to deploy NAF pilots to NCS’ air operations wing, so as to enhance its anti-smuggling operations.

He also called on the NAF and other Services to consider partnering with the NCS in the areas of capacity building and purposeful manpower development to improve the output of NCS personnel.

Specifically, the customs boss requested the assistance of the armed forces of Nigeria in the training of NCS personnel in para-trooping and other related fields. This, according to him, became necessary in view of inaccessible areas used as smuggling routes which are mostly unmotorable and difficult to navigate, hence the need for the NCS to begin to consider inserting its troops in these locations via para-dropping.

The MoU signing ceremony had in attendance key management staff of NCS as well as senior officers from the NAF.","The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to partner in order to strengthen border security and stem the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points.

Blessing Okagbare gets 10-year ban for doping,"The disciplinary tribunal of Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has handed Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian sprinter, a 10-year ban for breaching multiple anti-doping rules.

According to the statement released by AIU on Friday, the Nigerian got a five-year ban for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and another half-a-decade for her refusal to cooperate with the body’s investigation of her case.

The sprinter was suspended indefinitely during the Tokyo Olympics after the AIU had adjudged her to have tested positive for human growth hormone in one of the out-of-competition drug examinations she did in Slovakia on July 19.

She was thereafter slammed with three separate anti-doping charges by the body in October 2021.

In January 2022, the US department of justice had also allegedly identified Okagbare among the exhibits gathered against Eric Lira, the self-acclaimed kinesiologist and naturopathic doctor, who provided performance-enhancing drugs to athletes who participated at the Tokyo Olympics.

The 33-year-old has now been prohibited from all track and field events organised by World Athletics for the next decade.

“The Disciplinary Tribunal has banned Nigerian sprinter Blessing Okagbare for a total of 10 years, five years for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and five years for her refusal to co-operate with the AIU’s investigation into her case,” the statement read.

“The sole arbitrator adjudicating the case concluded that the athlete’s use of multiple prohibited substances as part of an organised doping regimen in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympic Games was egregious conduct that amounted to aggravating circumstances under the Rules thereby warranting an additional period of ineligibility on top of the standard four-year sanction.

“The sole arbitrator also recognised the AIU’s right to carry out investigations, including the imaging of electronic devices, and to impose sanctions when an athlete refuses to co-operate with an investigation and thereby frustrates the AIU’s ability to fulfil its mandate to protect the integrity of the sport of athletics.

“In this instance, the sole arbitrator concluded that the athlete’s refusal to cooperate had denied the AIU the opportunity to discover evidence of possible further rule violations by her as well possible violations of the rules by others, for which he imposed an additional sanction of five years.”

The statement added that the athlete has the right to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CaS) within 30 days.","The disciplinary tribunal of Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has handed Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian sprinter, a 10-year ban for breaching multiple anti-doping rules.

Lagos shuts school over ‘brutal flogging’ of two-year old pupil,"The Lagos state government has shut down Unic Vilos Montessori school after a two-year-old pupil was allegedly brutalised by her teacher.

According to Channels TV, Folashade Adefisayo, the state’s commissioner for education, confirmed that the ministry has ordered the closure of the school.

Adefisayo disclosed that the affected school operates without approval. She also said the state government is on the verge to to clamp down on such centres of learning.

Last week Friday, a relative to the pupil had alleged that the yet-to-be-identified teacher “brutally flogged” the little girl “because she could not recite the English alphabet.”

The incident had attracted a wave of criticism on social media platforms, with several Nigerians condemning the teacher’s action.

It also raised concerns over the rising cases of teachers subjecting their pupils to hostile treatments.

In his reaction, Jubril Gawat, special assistant on new media to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, said the case is already under probe.

According to him, the issue is being investigated by a joint team consisting of the ministries of education, justice as well as youth and social development.

The incident occurred at about the same time when another teacher in Delta was accused of subjecting a 19-month-old pupil to “brutal flogging”.

The toddler was said to have died a few days after the beating.

17 feared dead as petrol tanker collides with vehicle on Lagos-Ibadan expressway,"At least 17 persons reportedly died in an accident involving a Mazda bus and a petrol tanker at Isara Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway on Friday.

The collision was said to have resulted in a fire outbreak.

Ahmed Umar, the sector commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun, confirmed the incident to NAN.

Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases,"In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.

The growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021—its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.

Scams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called “rug pull”. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.

Cryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.

DeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.

DeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth—1,964%—for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens—all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.

While Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent “tokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges”.

Apart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.

In a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won’t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales—private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.

Despite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America’s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized £180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.

Earlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple’s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.

It’s all about seed rounds ￼,"Share this article:













Hello there,

The financial sector experienced a tremendous change last year, with massive growth in the use of digital financial services.

According to CB Insights’ ‘State of Fintech’ report, the third quarter of 2021 was the second highest on record for fintech financing, up 147 percent year on year, and 2022 appears to be more of the same.

It’s expected that fintechs will continue to drive financial inclusion, assisting in the development of a more accessible and sustainable digital economy for all, particularly in developing countries.

According to leading fintech enablement partner, Ukheshe Technologies, some of the biggest fintech trends poised to make an impact in the financial sector in 2022, include cross-border payments, mobile money, and buy now, pay later.

While this is most likely correct, given that African fintech company, Flutterwave, recently announced a $250 million Series D round, do you think any other industry will be able to compete with fintech companies in five years’ to a decade’s time in terms of financing? Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.

Well, today, I’ll be discussing:

Solving critical bankend freight industry challenges

Earnipay’s plans to reach 200,000 employees

Solving critical backend freight industry challenges















We all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.

For most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.

One of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.

Partech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.

Founded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.

According to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.

He also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company’s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.

Earnipay’s plans to reach 200,000 employees















Earnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.

The round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.

Nonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees’ financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.

Earnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.

What’s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.

By the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.

Nigeria’s shrinking economy records highest ‘growth’ under Buhari,"Nigeria’s economy may have grown by the most since 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari was first voted into office, but the size of the economy has shrunk since then and Nigerians are worse off.

The shrinking size of the economy means there is a smaller pie to share among Nigeria’s 200 million people, a painful squeeze for a country that is home to the world’s largest number of poor people.

That explains why many Nigerians can not relate with the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures put out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), according to Deji Obe, a Nigerian youth who has been without a job since what would be the first of two recessions in five years in 2016.

“The data gives the impression that things are finally getting better now that GDP growth has outpaced population growth for the first time since 2015,” Obe said. “But in reality, times are still very hard.”

The economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2021, the NBS said Thursday, marking the fastest growth rate in 7 years, helped by an improvement in the trade sector and low base effects. But the economy is valued at only $436.29 billion, 20 percent less than it was worth in 2014 ($546.67 billion). In that time the population has grown 13 percent.

“GDP numbers in isolation is incomplete when measuring the health of an economy, other factors like unemployment, poverty rate, inflation and human development index matter and Nigeria is nowhere near the desired level,” said Muda Yusuf , an economist and former head of trade advocacy group, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).

Nigeria is not only the world’s poverty capital, ahead of India which has five times its population, it’s unemployment rate at 33 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia and it has 7th highest inflation rate in Africa.

A cocktail of poor economic policies has made life in Nigeria tough, according to observers,

as tough as it has ever been in a long time.

Economists say the country’s performance in 2021, not significantly improved from the chaotic years since the recession in 2016, is made to look impressive by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when the economy shrank by the most in over two decades.

“The magnitude at which the economy contracted in 2020 has certainly had a big role to play in the 2021 growth numbers so it is no surprise,” said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and partner at consulting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC).

“The challenges the economy has faced since 2016 have not gone away, there is still a need for more fiscal and monetary reforms to take growth to sustainable levels,” Oyedele said.

While economists say the relatively high growth rate in 2021 is largely as a result of base effects, Harry Simon, who heads the government-owned NBS, could not agree more.

He said the impact of the low base effect could not be ruled out as it played a significant role in achieving the current figures and that it was not time to celebrate.

Trade sector records positive growth first time in 6yrs,"For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria’s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

According to the GDP report released Thursday by the NBS, the trade sector grew 8.62 percent.

Before now, it had contracted by 8.49 percent, 0.38 percent, 0.63 percent, 1.05 percent, and 0.24 percent in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Also, the growth rate in 2021 is the highest since 2012 (9.61%).

“The positive growth can be attributed to the low base effect, full reopening of the economy and the removal of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which has made activities in the trade sector to be much easier leading to its recovery,” Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, says.

Commenting in the same vein, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, notes that the recovery shows that businesses and economic activities have improved in the sector

“But despite the recovery, I am still bothered because the structural challenges such as high cost of foreign exchanges, weak demand, logistics issues, etc. still linger in the sector,” Adewale states.

The report also highlights that the country’s overall GDP grew by 3.98 percent (year-on-year) in Q4 ‘2021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 percent and -3.62 percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the pandemic.

“The fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 percent in 2021,” it states.

In terms of contribution to GDP, the trade sector contributed 15.66 percent, higher than the 15.46 percent it represented in the previous year, and higher than the 14.93 percent recorded in Q3 ‘2021.

Trade, which is the second biggest sector by output production, can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.

And due to this, the sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.

But in Africa’s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative territory since 2016 over myriad challenges like macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira’s depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.

Recently, a report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria’s real household consumption as a proportion of GDP rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post-pandemic for Nigeria’s consumer’s industry.

Additionally, a 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) reported that the country’s total retail sales rose to $108 billion after it had been trending south, falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015.

Analysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, said the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19.

Also, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says people have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones, noting, “E-commerce has also made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy.”","For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria’s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

LASAA launches e-Sticker verifier app for mobile advert registration,"The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the agency responsible for the regulation and control of all forms of signs and outdoor advertisement displays in Lagos State, has launched a dedicated e-Sticker Verification Application (app) for mobile avert registration by its clients.

The app which, according to the Agency, is available on Google and IOS store will help clients to authenticate the mobile advert Quick Response (QR) code issued to them by LASAA.

Speaking on the new app during the launch at the Agency’s head office recently, Managing Director of the Agency, Prince Adedamola Docemo explained that the LASAA e-Sticker Verification App is a reliable platform that allows LASAA field officers or law enforcement agencies to verify the authenticity of brand publication on automobiles in Lagos State.

“This innovation from the Lagos Signage Advertising Agency is a user-friendly interface that detects the brand registration information on stickers generated by LASAA to organisations and individuals respectively,” he said.

Docemo added that having registered brand information for automobiles on the LASAA sticker web platform and stickers generated, a field officer only needs to have the LASAA QR Code reader, which will decode the registration information of the branded publication.

Speaking further on the details of the application, LASAA’s Head of Corporate Communication & Strategy, Mr. Temitope Akande noted that information regarding the organisation or individual name, plate number (where applicable), brand type, vehicle type and branding type will be displayed seamlessly to verify the authenticity of the sticker.

“This platform has been developed to ensure branded automobiles have authorised stickers and to eradicate any occurrence of falsified brand information,” Akande said.

To use the application, clients should simply download and install the LASAA e-Sticker Verifier App from the Google store or App store.

Since the new mobile advert e-sticker was first launched and adopted in December 2021, the implication is that all old stickers became invalid, effective 1st of January 2022. The new sticker is aimed at stemming the activities of fraudsters and touts as well as middlemen who try to impersonate the staff of the Agency.","The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the agency responsible for the regulation and control of all forms of signs and outdoor advertisement displays in Lagos State, has launched a dedicated e-Sticker Verification Application (app) for mobile avert registration by its clients.

UNIAbuja VC Commends Federal Govt For Road Rehabilitation,"The vice-chancellor of the University of Abuja (UNIAbuja), Professor Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah has expressed appreciation to minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola and President Muhammadu Buhari for the rehabilitation of roads in the university.

Na’Allah made the appreciation during the formal handing over of 1.05 km of rehabilitated roads by the ministry under its intervention initiative in Abuja on Thursday.

He said what the government did is a gesture in the right direction, adding that what needs is huge because this is not up to what we need now but we are grateful.

“We have been trouble with the horrible road in the campus, if you go round, nobody needs not to tell you that roads are horrible, sometimes even dangerous, not just main campus, even Giri quarters and mini campus, these are the crisis we facing.”

“I have asked for a map of the entire main campus, very soon this map would be ready, that will specifically be described what is wrong, what we need, drainage system and we hope the ministry would come back to do more”.

In his remarks, the minister who was represented by Federal Controller of Works FCT, Engr. Yakubu Usman explained that Without quality education, a society can not develop, so it is quite significant.

“The quality of education will be impacted by the quality of infrastructure and the learning environment because education is the bedrock for functional and sustainable development and is the foundation of society.

“The gap of our infrastructure needs is steadily being bridged by a gradual process of repairs, renewal, and construction on major highways and it has reached the schools,” he said.

NNPC’s Energy Bank Proposal Receives African Oil Producers Backing,"African Oil producers have expressed support for the establishment of an energy bank to facilitate financing of major oil and gas projects in the continent.

The proposed energy bank is a decision being considered after Western nations threatened to halt overseas fossil fuel financing.

The decision has sparked alarm among Africa’s largest hydrocarbon exporters. But plans are afoot to create a new pan-African energy bank that can tackle waning oil and gas investment and drive-up production across the continent.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, and the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) are exploring the idea of establishing a so-called ‘African Energy Bank.’

ADVERTISEMENT

Afreximbank could not be reached for comment about the proposal, but the move has been cheered by industry lobby group, the African Energy Chamber, which says the value of such a bank ‘cannot be overstated.’

“Capital from foreign countries and companies will always be welcome, however regarding oil and gas, it isn’t reliable,” the group said in a statement.

“Therefore, through institutions such as the African energy bank, local oil and gas companies will be able to boost new and existing project developments; ensure reliable financing channels for oil and gas; and position the continent as a net exporter of hydrocarbons, all while creating critical capital opportunities for renewable energy projects,” it added.

The move comes about five months after minister of State for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, called for African governments to look into the initiative.

“If we insist on the exploration of our oil and gas reserves when the world is cutting down on investments in the sector, we must set a financial institution, an African Energy Bank, to develop the oil and gas sector,” Sylva said in September last year.

Speaking to Global Trade Review about the push to create an energy-focused bank on the continent, Adrian Lawrence, a partner in law firm Ashurst’s projects practice, says the initiative has been driven by the retreat of public and private finance from fossil fuels.

At the Cop26 climate summit in November, a number of countries pledged to end direct public financing for overseas fossil fuel development by the end of 2022, and to prioritise clean energy instead.

Already, many African countries rely heavily on oil and gas for their electricity needs. BP’s latest statistical review of world energy report shows the two fuels were responsible for roughly 48% of the continent’s total electricity generation in 2020.

“Large amounts of capital [will be needed] to implement these transition plans while supplying increasing amounts of power to their populations,” Lawrence said.

“There is thus a growing disconnect between the increasing financing needs of many African countries at a time when there is a narrowing range of institutions able or willing to fund even the most ‘bankable’ of [oil and gas] projects,” he added.

As the industry awaits the release of further details on the new energy bank, questions inevitably arise about how such an institution would find the necessary capital, with Africa’s major petroleum producers all suffering from a chronic lack of investment in recent years.","African Oil producers have expressed support for the establishment of an energy bank to facilitate financing of major oil and gas projects in the continent.

"Aregbesola, CSOs Trade Tackles Over Violence In Osun","Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State yesterday trade blame over the recent clash between the minister’s camp and that of the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, which attracted the attention of security agencies.

Reacting to the feud between the Osun State governor and the minister on the attendant spate of violence in the state, the coalition of CSO’O cast the first stone when it called on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the former governor of the state to order.

Addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, the coalition comprising The Osun Masterminds, Transparency and Accountability Group (TAG), Centre for Sustainable Dialogue (CSD), Oodua Youth Parliament (OYP), Osun Young Professionals (OYP), and Nigerians for Good Governance (NGG), alleged that the former Osun State governor and Interior Minister has been using security agencies under his control to threaten peace in the South-West state by instigating violence.

Dr Wasiu Oyedokun Alli, who spoke on behalf of the coalition said, “While superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.

“We have seen recently how men of the NSCDC, the NIS and the NCS sporadically shot in the air to terrify citizens of the State in Osogbo and other towns within the State. We refer to the official release of the Osun State Police Command, concerning the actions of men of the NSCDC, NIS and NCS.”

The Coalition urged President Buhari to sack Aregbesola from his cabinet ahead of July 16 governorship election in the state, accusing him of “shows of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the state, denigration of elder statesmen.

But firing back at the CSOs, Aregbesola asked Nigerians to disregard the CSOs, saying they are “the rent-a-crowd pseudo-NGOs.”

Speaking through his media assistant, Sola Fasure, the minister insisted that he was the victim rather than the aggressor in the violence perpetrated so far in the state.

He said, “It is on record that on Monday whilst returning from a well-attended political sensitisation rally in Ilesa, known hoodlums attacked the convoy of the Minister as he approached the popular Old Garage junction in Osogbo.

“His convoy comprising of well-trained officers of the Department of State Security, The Nigeria Police Force (charged with protecting the minister) and other security personnel drawn from the Paramilitary services, professionally responded to the daring attackers who were armed with diverse sophisticated weapons.

“Having failed to achieve their mission of killing the minister on Monday, the sponsors of the evil plot have now resorted to smearing his name, hoping to achieve through the back door, what they can’t get fairly on the field.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the minister is aware of his constitutional role as a member of the governing cabinet, a leading light of the ruling All Progressives Congress and as the Minister of Interior, charged with providing security for the nation.”

“However, the Minister, just like other Nigerians, also has the democratic right of association as enshrined in our constitution. This, in our opinion, doesn’t deserve the murder of any Nigerian, talk-less of a serving minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”","Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State yesterday trade blame over the recent clash between the minister’s camp and that of the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, which attracted the attention of security agencies.

WHO reports first wild polio outbreak in Malawi,"In Africa, the landlocked country of Malawi has reported the first wild polio outbreak on the continent in several years.

The wild type 1 poliovirus was discovered in a child in the city of Lilongwe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Friday.

Laboratory tests had shown that it had apparently been brought in from Pakistan, it said.

“As long as wild polio exists anywhere in the world all countries remain at risk of importation of the virus,” said WHO regional director Matshidiso Moeti.

The organisation will support local health authorities in the south-east African country to ensure that the case remains isolated and does not spread, she said.

Polio is a contagious infectious disease and can cause paralysis and death.

Except for Afghanistan and Pakistan, all countries in the world had beaten the wild polioviruses.

2023: Tambuwal Is PDP’s Best Bet For Presidency — GNC,"The Generation Next Collective, a group of youth and women’s organizations, has described Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as the finest candidate the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, can field for the 2023 presidential election.

As a result, the committee urged the party’s leadership to act quickly and be more explicit about the path the party plans to take in selecting its presidential candidate for the 2023 race.

“One person, in our estimation, that ticks the right boxes, is the Governor of Sokoto State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A lawyer, lawmaker, public administrator and chief executive of a state in the past seven years, it is our view and those of many, that the PDP would not be making a mistake with his choice and wealth of experience,” the group said.

GNC’s position was contained in a statement released by its co- conveners, Barrister Ruth Edehemon and Malam Rufai Abdulahi, in Abuja yesterday. It read:

“Across the nation, there is a general consensus, that 2023 election, should as a matter of importance, answer some nagging questions, among which are equity, justice and inclusion, the key tripod that ensure democratic balance.

“And PDP as a democratic party, should not shy away from this conversation that is rooted in fairness and truth. Beyond sentiments, the South and North are deserving of fair play and inclusion, a twin democratic feature that have been unwittingly starved by the government in power and would require an urgent restoration for the common good and unity of our dear nation.

“It is expedient that the PDP addresses the lingering ambiguity over which zone the presidential candidate should come from; and follow it up by building an honest purpose-driven, robust consensus, as may be allowed by law, around a suitable aspirant that possesses not only the leadership skill to unite the nation, but also be a veritable linkage between the older and the current generations; such that the sublimity of wisdom and restraint of leadership would find a meeting point with the treasure trove of the energy, creativity and ingenuity of the youth demography.

” Incontrovertible records show that the PDP as a party has managed the affairs of the nation at the presidency level for 16 years. And it’s a fact that the Southern part of the nation had held sway for over 14 years of the 16, through former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo 8 years (1999 -2007) and Goodluck Jonathan, 6 years (2010 – 2015). While the North had only ruled for a little over two years under the late former President Umaru Yar’Adua, who unfortunately died in office.

“So, we strongly believe that rather than this disturbing silence that is eliciting enflamed passion and seeming confusion, over the zone that should be supported for presidency in 2023 in the PDP, the party should be bold to speak up by putting this record into consideration, bring its leaders from both the North and South on a round table, address their deferent sentiments, do necessary in-house negotiations and present a formidable, united front that would give the party a meaningful chance in the challenge ahead.”

On the aspirant from the North with requisite leadership and managerial experience, personality and public appeal, that could benefit from the consensus approach, the GNC said: “With no prejudice to other prominent aspirants from the zone in PDP, the party should build consensus around someone with less controversy or negative public sentiments, with an unquestionable vigour for the demanding job of a president, essentially now that public scrutiny is rising over age and other physical variables of potential candidates, ahead of the general election.

“One person, in our estimation, that ticks the right boxes, is the Governor of Sokoto State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A lawyer, lawmaker, public administrator and chief executive of a state in the past seven years, it is our view and those of many, that the PDP would not be making a mistake with his choice and wealth of experience.

“Tambuwal’s privileged interactions with different interests, sectors and segments in and out of the Nigerian society, would enrich the contest and brighten the chances of the PDP, should it act fast and rally its faithful, contacts and resources around him.

"BREAKING: Buhari Government To Tax Goods, Services Brought In By Companies Without Nigerian Offices","The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has announced that it will begin taxing non-resident corporations who bring products or services into Nigeria.

The agency stated in a statement signed by Johannes Oluwatobi Wojuola, its Special Assistant to the Executive Chairman (Media & Communication), that it would use the Finance Act 2021’s instrumentality to raise revenue for Nigeria by collaborating with taxpayers and other stakeholders.

Muhammad Nami, the FIRS’ Executive Chairman, was quoted as saying this on Thursday while giving the keynote talk at KPMG’s Webinar on Nigeria’s 2022 Budget and the Finance Act 2021.

Nma said, “In the past, situations abound where certain goods or services streamed into Nigeria by non-resident companies, especially to consumers (B2Cs), were not subject to VAT. This raised the issue of equity, as goods and services offered by domestic companies are subject to VAT.

“With the amendment of Section 10 of the VAT Act and our publication of the ‘Guidelines on Simplified VAT Compliance Regime for Non-Resident Suppliers’, there is now a mechanism for applying VAT on such goods or services, affording the same tax treatment to both local and foreign supplies.



“Similarly, companies deriving income from Nigeria without physical presence can now be assessed, like other companies with physical presence, on fair and reasonable percentage of their turnover in line with Section 30 of CITA.”



On the automation of tax processes, the FIRS Executive Chairman noted that “with the amendment of Section 25 of the FIRS Establishment Act, the Service can now deploy either proprietary or third-party developed technologies for tax administration.”

“Those that may still stand in the way of achieving this objective will now be liable to a daily penalty of N25,000,” it added.

“With the extension of secrecy and confidentiality requirements to other persons, like service providers, vendors and consultants of the Service, the fear of taxpayers is further allayed on the secrecy and confidentiality of their commercial and other information,” it said.



Muhammad Nami further noted that with the amendment to Section 68 of the FIRS Establishment Act by the Finance Act, complaints from taxpayers about multiple agencies of government demanding payment of tax from them has been addressed.



He said, “This unfortunate situation is not in line with the national tax policy thrust and was causing confusion for our taxpayers and increasing their cost of compliance.

“However, the amendment to section 68 of the FIRS Act by the Finance Act 2021 has made it clear that FIRS is the only agency responsible for tax assessment, collection and enforcement.

"Breaking: Another fuel scarcity averted as NNPC, NUPENG, others reach truce","The Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) have suspended their planned strike after an intervention by the NNPC Ltd.

The parties also pledged collaboration on ensuring nationwide availability of petroleum products.

The suspension notice was made known in a communique following a critical stakeholders engagement between the NNPC Ltd., the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), PTD, NARTO, and NUPENG on Thursday, in Abuja.

The communique was jointly signed by Malam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Otunba Salmon Oladiti, National Chairman PTD , Mr Yusuf Otthman, NARTO President Comrade Williams Akporeha, NUPENG President and Abiodun Adeniji, Executive Director, Finance and Admin, NMDPRA.

NUPENG and PTD had planned to embark on strike following allegations that officials of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing were diverting the fund provided by NNPC Limited for the rehabilitation of 21 critical highways.

On Road Rehabilitation, the communique said NNPC provided updates on the current status of the road construction and rehabilitation projects under the road infrastructure tax credit scheme.

It said the NNPC assured the stakeholders that the funding earmarked for the 21 critical roads would be applied for the intended purpose only.

“To allay the fears of the stakeholders, NNPC and all parties commit to working together in the monitoring of the road projects,” it stated..

On review of freight rate for transporters, the communique noted that the stakeholders requested for completion of the ongoing discussion on the review of the freight rates to cover operational costs.

It noted that the stakeholders highlighted the precarious situation that truck owners faced in the light of current economic realities.

It further noted that the NMDPRA informed the meeting that a committee was constituted to review the rates which included PTD, NARTO and NUPENG in addition to other stakeholders.

It stated that all parties agreed to work expeditiously towards concluding the review of the freight rate and make recommendations to the Government.

According to the communique, the Authority is to advise on definite close-out date during the week of Feb. 21.

“The parties also agreed to foster collaboration on ensuring nationwide availability of petroleum products.

"Nigeria, Five Other African Countries To Begin Production Of Covid Vaccines – WHO","Nigeria and five other African countries have been chosen to begin production of COVID-19 vaccines, with the continent having had limited access to jabs.

“Today I’m delighted to announce the first six African countries that will receive technology from the hub to produce their own mRNA vaccines: Egypt, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, and Tunisia,” Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday.

According to the WHO, they were selected as the first recipients of technology from the organisation’s global mRNA vaccine hub, in a push to ensure the African continent can make its own jabs to fight COVID and other diseases.

“I was honoured to visit the Hub last week. And it’s already producing results, with Afrigen’s announcement that it has produced its own mRNA vaccine, based on publicly-available information about the composition of an existing vaccine,” Ghebreyesus said.

“We expect clinical trials to start in the 4th quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024. We expect the benefits of this initiative will extend far beyond #COVID19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria and tuberculosis”.

“WHO will work with the companies and the government in each country to develop a roadmap for training and production, based on their needs and capacities.

“Thank you all, and we look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success, for the healthier, safer and fairer Africa”.

According to the WHO boss, no other event like the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous.

He, therefore, stressed that the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need.

Tedros has continually called for equitable access to vaccines in order to beat the pandemic, and rails against the way wealthy nations have hogged doses, leaving Africa lagging behind other continents in the global vaccination effort.

A ceremony marking the mRNA tech transfer announcement was held Friday in Brussels at the summit between the European Union and the African Union.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said: “We have been talking a lot about producing mRNA vaccines in Africa. But this goes even beyond. This is mRNA technology designed in Africa, led by Africa and owned by Africa.”

Self-reliance

Currently, only one per cent of the vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent of some 1.3 billion people.

The WHO set up a global mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines.

The global hub’s role is to ensure that manufacturers in those nations have the know-how to make mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

As used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, mRNA technology provokes an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells.

Primarily set up to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the global hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other vaccines and products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.

The scheme’s ultimate goal is to spread capacity for national and regional production to all health technologies.

‘Mutual Respect’

The WHO said it would work with the first six countries chosen to develop a roadmap of training and support so they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.

Training will begin in March.

The South African hub is already producing mRNA vaccines at laboratory scale and is currently scaling up towards commercial scale.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday’s announcement “means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent”.

French President Emmanuel Macron said supporting African health sovereignty was one of the key goals of starting up local production, “to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time”.

More than 10.4 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, with nearly 62 percent of the global population having received at least one shot.

However, just 11.3 per cent of Africans had been fully immunised by the start of February.

In Nigeria, many are yet to be vaccinated despite efforts by authorities to make citizens get the jab.

On Thursday, the country recorded 45 new cases of the virus, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 254,182.

230,530 cases are, however, said to have recovered, while 3,141 deaths have been recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.

The 45 new cases were reported from eight states – Lagos (18), Cross River (7), FCT (7), Oyo (5), Kano (3), Nasarawa (3), Ekiti (1) and Rivers (1).

Across the world, the vaccine continues to rage on.

Here are some of the latest developments on the impact of the virus:

Japan eases strict border bar

Japan will ease its strict virus border rules to allow students and businesspeople into the country from March, but tourists will still be barred.

Portugal to lift most Covid rules

Portugal will no longer require people to present a health pass when going to restaurants and hotels, the government says, without providing a fixed date. Proof of vaccination is still necessary to enter the country.

Swiss president tests positive

On the day Switzerland lifts almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions, the government announces President Ignazio Cassis has tested positive.

Covid-19 pill

A South Africa regulator says it has approved the use of Merck’s Covid-19 pill for high-risk adults.

Canada Police Set to End Seige of Protesters Fighting Covid Measures,"Canadian police are poised to clear out on Friday hundreds of truck drivers from Ottawa who have staged a three-week-long protest against pandemic restrictions that has crippled the capital and prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assume emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years.

The drivers, joined by thousands of demonstrators and some 400 vehicles, turned the streets around Parliament into a noisy party zone since first arriving on Jan. 28, in what has become one of the worst crises to hit Trudeau since he took power in 2015. Police made a handful of arrests Thursday evening, including of Chris Barber, one of the main fundraisers and organizers, after authorities said action was imminent. Barber went without resistance after police told him he was being arrested for mischief. “We absolutely are committed to end this unlawful demonstration. We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,” interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday. Police will set up a perimeter with 100 checkpoints around downtown to stop people without legitimate reason from entering, he said.

“This weekend will look very different than the past three weekends,” he added. Previous chief Peter Sloly quit this week amid residents’ fury about what they saw as police inaction. The truckers’ protests started against vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, a measure in place in the United States, too. But slowly it spread across Canada and morphed into an anti-government movement. Protesters blocked several land crossings with the United States, including the busiest, the Ambassador Bridge which connects to Detroit, for six days, hurting both economies.

Calling the blockades a threat to democracy, Trudeau invoked emergency measures on Monday giving his government temporary powers to end the unrest. Government officials said they were worried about extremists causing violence.

“End the mandates, give us our rights and this is over,” said Chris Dacey on Thursday. “We’ll all go back to our families.” The border blockades turned the pressure on Trudeau to act swiftly, and U.S. President Joe Biden asked him to use federal powers. Many protesters on Parliament Hill said they would not leave until their demands were met. “The illegal blockades and occupations have to stop and the borders have to remain open,” Trudeau told legislators on Thursday as Parliament started debate on the Emergencies Act, which needs to be passed within seven days of an announcement.

But the official opposition Conservative Party says there was no need for the Emergencies Act, especially since the border blockades are over. Conservative Parliamentarian Jeremy Patzer told the House of Commons on Thursday that people around the world were alarmed to see Trudeau “come down on peaceful protesters with a sledgehammer.”","We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,” interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday.

"Mass Youth Migration to Europe Draining Africa’s Talent Pool, Buhari Laments","Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the mass migration of African youth to Europe, saying it drains the continent’s talent pool, while provoking political crises in Europe.

The president stated this in an article he penned to mark the participation of Nigeria at the ongoing 6th EU-AFRICA summit in Brussels, Belgium.

In the article published in Politico, an online/offline magazine which is the most influential publication for the EU/ in Brussels, Buhari noted that despite its best efforts, Europe would not find a sustainable remedy to this problem by further reinforcing its Fortress Europe approach.

According to him, instead, more opportunities must be created for Africans at home, providing alternatives to the decision to take a life-threatening boat journey in order to seek them elsewhere.

He advised that economic relationship between the two continents must be recalibrated to focus on job creation.

The president said, “By 2050, Africa’s population of 1.3 billion was set to double, making up a quarter of the world’s total. My country, Nigeria, is set to double its population to 400 million by then, surpassing the United States to become the third largest nation in the world.

“This means a huge youthful market right on Europe’s doorstep and — with increased trade a growing middle class with money to spend. However, despite burgeoning possibility, irregular northward migration from my continent drains Africa’s talent pool, while provoking political crises in the EU.

“When it comes to the relationship between the European Union and Africa, unfair arrangements have long been skated over for lack of alternatives.

“Increasingly unsustainable, these one-sided deals have provoked calls from both sides of the Mediterranean for a partnership of equals.

“At the EU-Africa Summit, leaders from across my continent will gather with their European counterparts to transform such rhetoric into substance. The EU is currently Africa’s largest trading partner, and Africa is the fastest growing continent on earth. While each presents the other with great opportunities, as partners, we also share a host of problems.

“Today, the EU-Africa relationship must be shifted toward a new economic arrangement in order to address them. The relationship between the EU and Africa must be rebalanced to power job creation. Unfortunately, today’s arrangements do just the opposite.

“Where some claim preferential trade policies with the EU lend a helping hand to Africa, the real picture is far more complicated. The Everything but Arms scheme grants 32 African countries tariff-free access to Europe’s protected markets. In addition to the fact that this excludes many of the continent’s 54 nations, there remain barriers to Europe’s markets even for countries that qualify.

“For example, though agricultural subsidies to EU farmers may not be the same as external tariffs, their effects are identical: They make Africa’s exports uncompetitive. More than €50 billion is ploughed into keeping European food produce cheap. “With its main export market distorted against them, African countries are deprived of foreign exchange, and investment in agriculture is stifled.

“Moving forward, it is clear what a new economic deal between our unions should entail: For Africa, it must offer a chance for a fundamentally new economic deal. For Europe, it must provide the chance to rid itself of a trade policy that quashes job-creation in Africa and hinders efforts to stem economic migration to Europe. The way forward is clear, the deal just needs to be struck.”

"Nigeria’s Economy Records 3.4% GDP Growth, Highest Since 2014","RelatedStories No Content Available

Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.40 per cent in 2021, the highest since 2014, when the economy grew by 6.22 per cent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) disclosed on Thursday.

According to the National GDP Q4 report released by the NBS, the expansion in economic activities was majorly driven by the non-oil sector.

The report also revealed that the country’s GDP grew by 3.98 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year (Q4 2021), lower than the 4.03 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter.

The performance indicated a sustained positive growth for five consecutive quarters since the recession witnessed in 2020, when output contracted by 6.10 per cent and 3.62 per cent respectively in the Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to report by the statistical agency, the economy was largely driven by the non-oil sector, which accounted for 94.81 per cent of GDP while the oil sector contributed 5.19 per cent to growth.

The Q4 growth indicated a steady economic recovery, accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 per cent in 2021. It noted that growth rate under the review period was higher than the 0.11 per cent recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87 percentage points and lower than 4.03 per cent recorded in Q3 by 0.05 percentage points.

The NBS, nevertheless, stated that quarter-on-quarter, real GDP grew at 9.63 per cent in Q4, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter.

The average daily oil production stood at 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd), lower than the 1.57mbpd in Q3 and 1.56 mbpd in Q4 2020.

Oil growth rate stood at -8.06 per cent in real terms in Q4 and annual growth rate of -8.30 per cent in 2021. On an annual basis, oil contributed 7.24 per cent compared to 8.16 per cent in 2020.

The non-oil sector, which excluded crude petroleum and natural gas activities, recorded a growth of 4.73 per cent in real terms, an improvement from the 1.69 per cent reported in Q4 2020.

The sector recorded an annual growth of 4.44 per cent compared to -1.25 per cent in 2020.

However, annual contribution of the non-oil sector increased to 92.76 per cent from 91.84 per cent in 2020.

The services sector contributed 55.11 per cent to the total growth while agriculture contributed 26.84 per cent to overall GDP in real terms in Q4, lower than 29.94 per cent in the preceding quarter and 26.95 per cent in Q4 2020.

The manufacturing sector contributed 8.46 per cent, lower than the 8.60 per cent lower than 8.96 per cent in Q3 and 8.98 per cent in Q4 2020.

In nominal terms, aggregate GDP stood at N49.28 trillion in Q4, higher than the N43.56 trillion in Q4 2020, and indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.11 per cent.

Nominal GDP in the preceding quarter of Q3 2021 stood at N45.11 trillion, while annual nominal value in 2021 was N173.53 trillion as compared to N152.32 trillion in 2020, indicating a growth rate of 13.92 per cent.

In terms of real GDP which shows the volume of economic activities, the sum of N20.33 trillion was recorded in Q4, higher than N18.54 trillion in the preceding quarter and also by N778.91 billion compared to N19.55 trillion recorded in Q4 2020.

The nominal GDP growth rate in Q4 was higher relative to 10.07 per cent growth recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020 but lower compared to 15.41 per cent growth recorded in the preceding quarter.

However, in 2021 annual nominal growth stood at 13.92 per cent.

According to the NBS, “The improvement being seen in the output growth in the last five quarters depicts a steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy.

“Globally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic. Thus, economic recovery is a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors.

“However, in Nigeria, the prospects of consolidating the recovery are glaring considering the improved economic performance over these periods of time.”

"‘14% women raped, 91% sexually harassed by bosses’","About 91 per cent of cases of sexual harassment in workplaces faced by women were being perpetrated by their bosses and superiors, research by a civil rights organization, HEIR Women Development Initiative, revealed.

HEIR Women Development is a social enterprise borne out of the need to see young women take on more decision-making positions, and venture into leadership opportunities.

The organisation also said that while three in four; 74 per cent of the women have experienced online stalking, 68 per cent attest to receiving persistent emails, sexual invitations, with 81 per cent confirming that this sexual harassment had been rife.

These were the findings of “Career barriers and workplace sexual harassment against young women in Nigeria: Research validation meeting and extract on the Federal Character Territory”, carried out by HEIR WDI with support from Ford Foundation.

The report of the research which was signed by the Programme Officer of HEIR Women Development, Blessing Ejeh, was obtained by Journalists in Abuja on Friday.

According to the research, while 14 per cent of the respondents revealed that “they have been raped at workplaces”, only 33 per cent of organizations were concerned about protecting women’s rights even as 68 per cent lacked gender responsiveness in their organizations.

The report said, “Three in five women; 57 per cent, have experienced physical sexual harassment which respondents reported in form of unwelcomed touching, deliberate pinching among others. 14 per cent of the respondents revealed that they have been raped at work. The major perpetrators of sexual harassment at work are seen to be bosses or superior, 91 per cent reported.

“Also, three in four; 74 per cent of these women have experienced online stalking while 68 per cent attest to receiving persistent emails, invitations sexual nature with 81 per cent confirming that this sexual harassment is being experienced often.”

The CSO said 68 per cent of the respondents reported a lack of gender responsiveness in their organization because the Human Resources Department is often charged with the responsibility of drafting protective policies on sexual harassment.

“However, their goal is to protect the interest of bosses to the detriment of other staff”, the report revealed.

The research said, “Despite these scary statistics, just 49 per cent of the respondents consider their workspace to be unsafe, which is a clear indication of the low awareness among these women of what sexual harassment entails and its dangers.”

Ejeh also shed light on how sexual harassment affects career development.

She said, “Sexual harassment has constituted a major limiting factor to women’s career journey at workplaces and participation in leadership for decades now. Therefore, this germane project seeks to identify with evidential data, the career barriers confronting young women with a lens into sexual harassment menace. Hence our theory of change is as follows- if young women are empowered with adequate tools to recognize and report sexual harassment at work, then organizations are encouraged to develop and ensure compliance with sexual harassment policies.

“Then, young women will have to be equipped to excel in their career and leadership aspirations. 51 per cent of the respondents reported that they have been sexually harassed at their workplace. 39 per cent of the respondents revealed that there were no systems, laws, policies to protect them at their workplaces while 35 per cent revealed that although “Therefore, it is believed that laws on sexual harassment are non-existence as this is clearly shown in the fact that the labour law made no provision on sexual harassment at workplaces.”

"Osinbajo, Makinde eulogise Alao-Akala as ex-gov buried in Ogbomoso","Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Friday led prominent Nigerians to pay their last respect to former governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, who was buried at his residence in Ogbomoso.

Governors and other politicians from the two leasing political parties on the country, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party stormed Beulah Baptist Church, Ogbomoso where the funeral service was held in honour of the former governor before his remains were buried at his residence.

Alao-Akala, who won election on the platform of the PDP in 2007 to become Oyo State governor eventually dumped the party and was the leader of the APC in Oyo State when he died on January 12.

Apart from the Vice President, the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigerian Governors’ Forum; Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde; his deputy, Rauf Olaniyan; Ogun State Deputy Governor, Noimot Oyedele Salako, attended the service.

Former governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola; former governor Ibikule Amosun and the Deputy National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Ambassador Taofek Arapaja among others were also present at the ceremony.

The Vice President Yemi Osinbajo described Alao-Akala as an open-minded politician, who would be missed for his magnanimity and compassion.

He said the late governor served the interest of his people when he was in power and gave quality counsel to those who were around him.

Osinbajo said the late politician in his lifetime as the governor was an accountable personality who improved the Internationally Generated Revenue of the state from N300 million to N1billion.

Osinbajo also described Alao-Akala as a very responsible and respectful to the views of individuals.

He said the late politician would be missed for his counsel and compassion.

Osinbajo said, “Everywhere Alao-Akala went in his days as governor, you would hear the chant of ‘Oyato’. Of course, he really did many things differently in office.

“He significantly improved the IGR of the state from a paltry N300m to N1bn in eight months and put in place very good security architecture.

“Alao-Akala practically demonstrated what is possible when you have creativity and compassion. Since his transition in January, I have read several glowing tributes to his memory and the common refrain running through all of those tributes has been the attestation to his uncommon generosity.

“He was indeed a simple and humane man, who practised politics with an open mind. Many testified that his resources were available to all and his home was there for anyone to come for help.”

Makinde, who declared that the state government would immortalise the late former governor, said a committee headed by his Chief of Staff, Hon. Segun Ogunwuyi, has been put in place to work on how best to honour the late Chief Alao-Akala.

He said, “As for the children who came with a request, I know how you feel and I will champion the cause to redeem whatever it is the late governor Alao-Akala has promised them.

“Finally, I have been going around determining how we can honour our great man from Oyo State. We have set up a committee headed by the Chief of Staff. If you also have any advice in this regard, let us know and, within the shortest period of time, the government of Oyo State will ensure that he is adequately honoured.

“On that note, I want to say farewell to a great man, my brother, my mentor and a great son of Ogbomosoland.”

A’Ibom first Lady cautions against out-of-court settlement for rape cases,"By Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo

The Akwa Ibom State First Lady, Dr Martha Udom Emmanuel, has advised the state police command not to encourage granting of bail and out-of-court settlement for rape cases.

Dr Emmanuel who gave the advice yesterday when she paid a courtesy visit on the State Commissioner of police, Mr Andrew Amiengheme, stressed that all rape cases should be channeled to the family unit and not to be settled out of Court.

She also urged the police command to refrain from harassing and demanding money from victims of Gender- Based Violence, (GBV) before their cases are attended to, as such scares the victims from going to the police to lodge their complaints.

The first Lady who was accompanied by the GBV management committee, also noted that demanding money from already wounded and traumatized victims was an act of insensitivity.

Her words: “We are here to officially tell you that we want to work with you and we want you to work with us. I’m saying this because there are some police stations in some local governments that are not friendly.

“I want you sir to have meeting with them and address this issue. We’ve been fighting this menace over the years now, especially cases of rape that has been on the high side. So far the police most time have cooperated with us.

“They should not be demanding from somebody that is already wounded, adding salt into injury. Also, settlement of rape cases and granting of bails should not be encouraged. When they do that, these people will go out there and be bragging.

“And it takes the intervention of another policeman to re-arrest them. It shouldn’t be like that. We should follow one guideline. The officers should empathize with the victims and give them succour”

The first lady also frowned at the situation where some police officers blame GBV victims by attributing the women’s woes to either their way of dressing and bad attitude at home.

Responding, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Andrew Amiengheme thanked the First Lady and her team for the visit, and reassured them that offenders would be made to face the law.

The CP, however, noted that most rape victims were reluctant to come forward to pursue their cases when they are offered money, and blamed the development on the high level of poverty.

“I want o assure you that since I came I’ve ensured that any GBV case is settled in no other place than the court. Some people go as far as petitioning the AIG. The AIG does not interfere in such matters of GBV, but he will tell you, make sure it goes to court.” The CP noted.","By Chioma Onuegbu, UyoThe Akwa Ibom State First Lady, Dr Martha Udom Emmanuel, has advised the state police command not to encourage granting of bail and out-of-court settlement for rape cases.

Scammers target hotel customers in Lagos,"By David Royal

The management of a Lagos hotel has raised the alarm on how scammers are targeting customers by deceiving them into paying money into a private bank account belonging to the scammers instead of the hotel’s approved bank account for bookings.

This allegation was made by the management of Integrity Hotels & Suites situated at Abagbon close, Victoria Island, Lagos, noting that it uncovered plans by the scammers to swindle money from more of its customers.



Some customers had complained that they were involved in series of unfulfilled hotel room bookings online without getting values after making payments into an individual’s account, who claimed to be the manager of the hotel.



The hotel said it gathered that the scammers offered hotel room bookings on an online platform, but buyers purportedly did not receive their bookings after making payment.

Posing as the hotel managers, the scammers have diverted thousands of money into their bank accounts, a practice they began last year.

One of the staff members of the hotel, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “We got complaints from customers that they made payment to the bank accounts of some people they contacted through a number displayed on the hotel site.



“They have an online platform and they include their contact number alongside our hotel’s name and address, making unsuspecting customers believe that they are the management of our hotel. We don’t really know how much has been lost but we have been receiving calls from different customers reporting these scammers.”



He further appealed to the public to disregard or report anyone online posing as a staff of Integrity Hotels & Suites.

Vanguard News Nigeria","By David RoyalThe management of a Lagos hotel has raised the alarm on how scammers are targeting customers by deceiving them into paying money into a private bank account belonging to the scammers instead of the hotel’s approved bank account for bookings.
This allegation was made by the management of Integrity Hotels & Suites situated at Abagbon close, Victoria Island, Lagos, noting that it uncovered plans by the scammers to swindle money from more of its customers.
Some customers had complained that they were involved in series of unfulfilled hotel room bookings online without getting values after making payments into an individual’s account, who claimed to be the manager of the hotel.
The hotel said it gathered that the scammers offered hotel room bookings on an online platform, but buyers purportedly did not receive their bookings after making payment.

"Again, gunmen attack Okomu oil palm plantation in Edo","Gunmen yesterday again attacked the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s plantation in Ovia Southwest Local Government Area of Edo State, a day after two suspects were paraded by the state’s police command on their involvement in the February 1 this year’s attack.

The sudden attack by the suspected criminals led to the death of two staff of Okomu company and the burning of 90 hectares of rubber plantation and three excavators.

Okomu oil palm company’s Communication Officer, Fidelis Olise, yesterday in Benin, disclosed that the gunmen also carried out an attack at the plantation on Tuesday, thereby making it two attacks in three days.

Olise noted that the gunmen, whom he described as terrorists, carried out the latest attack, in retaliation for the arrest of two of their supposed members.

He said: “The same terrorists, seemingly angered by the arrest of two of their supposed members, carried out further attacks on innocent workers on the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s property, to avenge the arrest of their accomplices, who apparently confessed to the theft of rubber lumps.

“The suspected thieves were arrested by the marine police in a boat, after it had left Okomu Ijaw community, on its way to neighbouring Delta State.

“Killing of innocent workers of Okomu company, who are performing their legitimate duties, and have no conflict or disagreement with any person, is strongly condemned. The powers that be should immediately take action against the terrorists responsible for the murderous crimes.

“Attacks on companies like Okomu call for concern, as terrorists are now focusing on such establishments, intent on bringing them to their knees, and in so doing create an impression that the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led government is weak. The attacks also pose great threat to the current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administrations.”

Okomu’s communication officer also stated that the time had come for the Obaseki and Buhari’s administrations to take decisive actions against the terrorists, declaring that otherwise, investments in the agricultural sector would be greatly affected, as it was the case with pipeline vandalism in the past, with the resultant negative effects on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both the state and federal government’s coffers.

He urged the police to thoroughly investigate the incessant attacks on the company’s facilities and bring the perpetrators to book, in order to serve as a deterrent to others.

Olise admonished the authorities of the military, especially the Nigerian Army and Navy, to deploy their personnel in the area, in order to ensure adequate security for residents of Ovia Southwest LGA, their property and investments, with the terrorists and cultists to be dislodged from the area.

It will be recalled that police in Edo state on Thursday at Gelegele near Benin in Ovia Northeast LGA of Edo, paraded two arrested men: Destiny Tibhor, 22, and Lucky Clark, 52, for invading Okomu oil palm company, and stealing rubber lumps belonging to the firm, while they were apprehended on February 15.

The suspected criminals were paraded by the state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Bello Kontongs, a Superintendent of Police (SP), who noted that Edo Police Commissioner, Phillip Ogbadu, facilitated the arrests, in an attempt to unravel the persons behind the attacks.

Kontongs revealed that the marine police component, led by Courage Ogonmwan, SP, while on patrol in the area, intercepted the suspects on Okomu waterway, while adding that further investigation would determine whether the two suspects were among the criminals who were involved in the attacks on Okomu oil palm plantation or not.","Gunmen yesterday again attacked the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s plantation in Ovia Southwest Local Government Area of Edo State, a day after two suspects were paraded by the state’s police command on their involvement in the February 1 this year’s attack.

Minister to INEC: Improve on faulty BVAS machine,"Following the outcomes of the just-concluded area council elections, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to as a matter of urgency improve on the functionality of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS).

The minister gave the charge at the presentation of the certificate of returns to the newly elected chairmen and councilors of the area council elections held on February 12, 2022.

Aliyu stressed that in the course of monitoring the voting process it was observed that the process was slow at several polling units owing to faulty BVAS machines.

The minister, therefore, tasked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to as a matter of urgency look into BVAS machines malfunctioning or in the alternative allow electorate accredited to vote manually as the nation approaches general elections.

According to a statement issued on Friday by her Special Assistant, Media, Austine Elemue, the minister said: “Today is another remarkable day in the history of FCT as we have successfully conducted one of the most peaceful elections in the third tier of government in Nigeria.

“The elections have been won and lost, but today’s event is for the presentation of certificates of return to the newly elected chairmen of the six area councils and councilors of the 62 wards of FCT. It is worthy to note that the FCT Administration does not in any way interfere with the conduct of the elections. This alone entails transparency.

“However in the course of monitoring the election process in the six area councils the voting process was slow at several polling units because the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) machine was faulty or malfunctioning.

“The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should as a matter of urgency look into BVAS machine malfunctioning or in the alternative allow electorate accredited to vote manually. I did not say cancel the BVAS, because I am not a contestant in any way here.”","Following the outcomes of the just-concluded area council elections, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to as a matter of urgency improve on the functionality of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS).

"FG reforms to meet demand for additional 15,262Mw","Concerned about how to bridge the gap between the National Peak Demand Forecast of 19,788Mega Watts (MW) and the Peak Generation of 16th February, 2022, the Federal Government has sought to attain a financially healthy and technically robust Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI).

Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) Plc, Managing Director, Dr. Nneaemeka Ewelukwa disclosed at the weekend during the capacity building workshop for members of Power Correspondents Association (PCAN) and Civil Society Organization in Lagos.

The theme of the workshop was ‘Building knowledge and plugging skills gap in power sector reporting.’

He said, “this mismatch is worrying the government that wants it to match.”

Ewelukwa added that the government’s plan is to keep expanding generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the country’s demand.

Noting that the electricity market is a question of ability and willingness to pay for supplied power, he said that it will be critical to ensure that the electricity that will flow in the system is procured.

He insisted that the loan which the Federal Government is investing in the sector must be repaid through payment for consumed energy.

According to him, the distribution companies are improving their performance and facilities to bring the 15,262MW.

On how to bridge the gap, he said: “For you to bridge the gap between Peak Demand and Peak Generation, it speaks to these market reforms because two things need to happen.

“The system must have the ability to physically move that power. Two, if the system can move that additional power and GenCos are to bring that additional power.

“It must be paid for. So, it brings us back to the point I made about a sector that is financially healthy and technically robust.”

He said that the critical reforms that the government has embarked on are designed to ensure the financial health of the market and technical capacity to remove the deficit in supply to meet the demand of the country.

According to him, the government has begun the implementation of the transmission expansion plan which works in sync with the FGN/Simens Presidential Power Initiative with phase one 7,000mw, phase two 11,000Mw and phase three 25,000MW supply.

Asked to state the timeline for bridging the Gap, Ewelukwa revealed that “because this government is keen to implement these reforms, to be honest with you, we are having sleepless nights to achieve these. They are milestones. They are targets.”

He recalled that at inception, the NBET took over the Power Purchase Agreements that the defunct Power Holding Company (PHCN) signed with Agip, which had a gas component.

Ewelukwa noted that this is accountable for while the company is involved in the transaction for supplying gas to the Calabar Generation Company.

He explained that NBET’s function in a Transition Electricity Based Market is characterized by a market-based agreement for electricity trading.

Ewelukwa noted that the NBET is designed to be a temporary bridge in the electricity market.

NBET, he said, has a long term role to drive market competition by ensuring that it is moved from a government centres market to a private sector-driven electricity market.

Continuing, he vowed that going forward: “We no longer need to buy power as a central procurer of electricity rather the power we have purchased we will stand the process of handing it over to the DisCos and the GenCos so that the DisCos can now say I want to buy power directly from GenCos.

“We are enthusiastically looking at the point when we will actually start the innovation process of handing over the PPAs we signed to distribution licensees and eligible customers as the case may be.”","On how to bridge the gap, he said: “For you to bridge the gap between Peak Demand and Peak Generation, it speaks to these market reforms because two things need to happen.

Economy: PDP not qualified to cast aspersion – APC,"The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lacks the locus to cast aspersions on the economic growth recorded by the Federal Government.

The governing party maintained that the sustained growth of the country’s economy was not a fluke, but the result of deliberate policies of President Muhammadu Buhari led administration

Faulting the opposition, APC accused the opposition of being solely responsible for the country’s economic woes.

Secretary to the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John James Akpanudoedehe in a reaction to PDP outburst to the 4th-Quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which reflected 3.4 per cent growth in 2021 and the strongest since 2014, said the APC has been repairing the mess left by the 16 years of misrule of PDP.

He noted: “As reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its 4th-Quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report, Nigeria’s economy grew 3.4% in 2021, the strongest since 2014 and showed sustained positive growth for the 5th quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020.

- Advertisement -

“The country’s economy grew faster than forecast by the Central Bank and government last year after an expansion in the agriculture and trade industries in the fourth quarter offset a sharp drop in oil production.

“The question begging for answers is the reason behind the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) pessimism and gloom over the NBS Report. Against the backdrop of the opposition Party’s doomsday wishes for the country, deflated PDP says the NBS Report is fake.

“It is clear that the PDP is still stuck on the voodoo economics it used to hide stealing and the shocking mismanagement of the economy under its watch until Nigerians voted the PDP out in favour of the APC government to restore sanity in the economy and other sectors of our national life.”

The ruling party then joined other well-meaning Nigerians to celebrate the many positives of the country’s sustained economic growth which consolidates our rank as Africa’s largest economy.

Akpanudoedehe maintained, “Our economic growth is not mere happenstance, but as a result of deliberate programmes and policies of the President Muhammadu Buhari government to reflate, diversify and grow the economy from its former shoddy state.

“As a direct result of this government’s non-oil sector economic diversification drive, agriculture; trade; Information and Communications Technology; and Financial and Insurance Institutions, accounted for positive GDP growth, as reported by the NBS.

“Significantly, the non-oil sector grew by 4.73%, contributing 94.81% to the nation’s GDP in the fourth quarter 2021.”

The party drew the attention of PDP to Thursday’s report of Nigeria’s second peer review by the AU-NEPAD which noted thus: “…tremendous progress and success have been made in many areas, particularly in infrastructure development, agricultural revolution, humanitarian services, fight against corruption and so many more for which Nigeria was highly commended by the forum of Heads of State and Government at the 31st Ordinary Session of the AU on the 4th of February, 2022.”

APC then enjoined “the PDP not to be the enemy within as it laboriously tries to in the guise of opposition politics. Besides, the fact that PDP governments are solely responsible for Nigeria’s economic mess which the APC government is repairing leaves the PDP least qualified to cast aspersions on the economic growth being recorded.

“All well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders should support this government to consolidate on our economic wins and efforts to entrench good governance practices which ultimately translates to transparency, accountability and an enabling environment for sustainable development. Nigerians will be the ultimate beneficiaries.”","The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lacks the locus to cast aspersions on the economic growth recorded by the Federal Government.

Anambra accident: Police react as truck drivers block Onitsha-Owerri road,"The Anambra State Police Command on Saturday reacted to the fatal accident which occurred at a police checkpoint on the Onitsha-Owerri Road, Ihiala Local Government of the state.

The accident occurred when a truck with number plate UWZ556XA, rammed into six other vehicles around Ken Maduako Oil and Gas Filling Station along the Ihialla-Onitsha road area of the state, killing two persons and injuring nine others on Friday.

It was gathered that the truck driver, who was on a top speed, while approaching the police checkpoint at Ihiala, lost control and rammed into the vehicles on the queue at the checkpoint and crashed.

No fewer than 63 persons were involved in the crash as it also involved commercial vehicles. Some motorists escaped unhurt.

It was gathered that the accident created some pandemonium around the scene as members of the truck drivers union blocked the busy Onitsha-Owerri Road, on noticing that the accident was a result of the police checkpoint in the area.

The truck drivers mobilised heavy trucks around the scene of the accident and blocked the ever busy highway on both sides, an action, which caused heavy gridlock on that road.

The real reason for their actions was not provided, but eyewitnesses said they were protesting the havoc the police checkpoint is causing motorists on that road, as a similar event had occurred a few months ago on that axis.

The eyewitness lamented that motorists are always being asked to come down from their vehicles to trek past the police checkpoint, an action that has become a burden to the motoring public.

However, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echeng, had commiserated with the families of the two persons who died and the nine others, who sustained injuries in the accident.

In a statement on Saturday, the police spokesman, DCP Ikenga Tochukwu, identified the driver of the truck as one of the victims that died in the crash while attributing the fatal crash to overspeeding and brake failure by the trailer driver.

The police said the truck drivers were misinformed about the cause of the accident, which led to their protest while appealing to them to have a rethink.

The statement read in part, “While the Police indeed have a ‘Stop and Search Point’ close to the scene of the accident, it is wrong to blame the police for the unfortunate incident.

“The fact that only six vehicles were on the queue on a dual carriageway as busy as that expressway is evidence that the Police has been responsible and sensitive to the plight of the motoring public by ensuring minimal delay as it conduct its stop and search operations aimed at protecting not only Police facilities in the area from insurgents’ attacks, but also the general public, who are mostly at the receiving end of escapades by criminal elements.”

The police boss, however, commended the officers of the Federal Road Safety Corps for promptly rising to the occasion and partnering with them in getting the injured to the hospital and clearing the wreckage from the road to allow for free flow of traffic.

“It is unfortunate that drivers of container bearing trailers, under the umbrella of their union, who were misinformed about the cause of the accident mobilised heavy trucks to the scene at about 1630 hours on the day of the accident and blocked the ever busy highway on both sides.

“All entreaties made to them to consider the plight of the motoring public fell on deaf ears. Innocent motorists were at the receiving end of this ill-advised blockade.

“The Nigeria Police wish to appeal to the unionists to have a rethink in the interest of their fellow citizens and consider the plight of stranded travellers to remove the blockade from the highway. The Police will continue to explore peaceful means of resolving the imbroglio to prevent further loss of precious human lives,” the statement added.

It also added that the CP, while thanking the good public for their robust support, assured them that the Police would continue to raise the bar of service delivery in the interest and safety of the law-abiding public.

Anambra retired teachers lament unpaid four-year gratuities,"The retired teachers in Anambra State have protested the nonpayment of their gratuities by the state government for four years.

They, therefore, asked Governor Willie Obiano to pay the backlog of their gratuities which had accrued since 2017 before leaving office in March.

The angry retirees protested along the Teachers’ House Road, Awka, on Friday, carrying placards with various inscriptions.

Some of the placards read, “Obiano, pay us our pension and gratuity in line with the approved structure,” “Give us our arrears of pension,” “Our gratuities are our rights,” “Pay us now that we are alive,” and “Is it when we die that others will collect what we worked for?”

The spokesperson of the group, Mrs Victoria Maduka, who retired as a Zonal Director in 2018 from Ogidi zone, explained that many of them, including those who retired in 2017, were yet to receive any payment from the government having served for thirty-five years.

Maduka expressed regret that the situation had adversely affected them, as they struggled to eat, pay hospital and electricity bills as well as house rents and children’s school fees.

She said that it was unfortunate that despite the letter they wrote to the government three weeks ago, no response had been given to them as regards what was delaying their gratuities in the last four years.

According to her, though the tenure of the present administration would end in less than one month, they believed their emoluments could still be paid considering the efforts and sacrifices they had put in moving the state forward.

Another retiree, Mr. Raymond Achebe, while narrating the impact of the long denial of their monies on their families, appealed to the government to consider their plights and pay them.

The teachers lamented that they recently buried a deputy director, who died while waiting for the state government to pay her emoluments after 35 years of service.

"Ex-militant leader, Akpodoro, elected Mayor of Urhoboland",".

An ex-militant leader and Head of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, NCNDE-A, Eshanekpe Israel, a.k.a Akpodoro has been elected the Mayor of Urhoboland by Gbaregolor Federated Communities led by Chief Edemini Epiagbaga the Okpako-Orere of the Gbaregolor Federation.

This was made known by the Okpako Orere-in-Council during a well-attended event in the ancient community of Gberegolor, Ughelli South Local Government Area of the oil-rich Delta State, South-South Nigeria.

In his address during the ceremony with the President-Generals of seven other communities in attendance, the Okapko Orere reeled out the achievements of the former warrior to include his dedication to the growth and development of Urhobo land in particular and Nigeria in general noting that His Excellency, Akpodoro brought pride to Urhobo nation, particularly during the disarmament of reluctant militants who weren’t willing to disengage from militancy at the dawn of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, in the Niger Delta region.

Chief Epiagbaga noted that Akpodoro was he who in conjunction with the Nigerian armed forces averted what would have been a bloody war in the Niger Delta during the renewed insurgency in the region in 2016. He said the new Mayor of Urhobo Land was he who tamed rather than supported the Avengers in their onslaught against the economic wellbeing of the nation.

Akpodoro, he noted deserves all the honours and privileges in Urhobo Land owing to his unwavering belief in the Urhobo project noting that the Mayor remains the only Urhobo Youth who can hold his own anywhere in the world without let or hindrance and on account of this labyrinth of achievements, he conferred on Akpodoro, who is the National Taskforce Chairman, of the Association of Nigerian Refineries and Petroleum Marketers, ANRPM the Mayoral honour.

“In recognition of your outstanding and excellent distortions to the development and growth of Urhoboland, you are awarded the Mayor and we hope you take Urhobo nation to the highest level. We believe in you,” the Okpako Orere stated.

In appreciation to the leadership and the people of the Federated Communities, Akpodoro said he was humbled by the honour done him saying it was a great privilege and higher call to serve Urhobo land and the entire nation saying the struggle for a greater Urhobo people is his life as he called for unity of purpose, peace in Urhoboland noting that only a peaceful people can be developed.","An ex-militant leader and Head of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, NCNDE-A, Eshanekpe Israel, a.k.a Akpodoro has been elected the Mayor of Urhoboland by Gbaregolor Federated Communities led by Chief Edemini Epiagbaga the Okpako-Orere of the Gbaregolor Federation.

DELTA 2023: Anioma Traditional Rulers back senatorial zoning,".

.. say status quo should be maintained

..as DC-23 visits, lobby Delta North Monarchs

By Festus Ahon, ASABA

AS the struggle for which senatorial district should produce the next Governor of the State ranges on, Delta North Traditional Rulers Forum, Friday, insisted on senatorial zoning arrangement, arguing that zoning based on ethnicity was not tenable.

Chairman of the Forum, Obi (Prof) Chike Edozien who disclosed this when the Delta Central Senatorial District, DC-23 led by Senator Ighoyota Amori paid a consultative visit to Anioma traditional rulers, said the status quo of the zoning arrangement put in place in the days of former Governor James Ibori should be maintained.

Edozien who was joined by over 35 Delta North Traditional Rulers in his Palace to receive the DC-23 delegates, said: “Delta State is for everybody and as traditional rulers, we preach peace because we want peace to reign. When there is peace, there will be progress.

“We all know very well the position of Delta State in the nation’s economy. Therefore, Delta State cannot afford to make mistakes, we can’t afford to have peace because anything that disturbs Delta State peace is going to affect the whole country.

“This is our State, we don’t have any other place to relocate to; we want peace in Delta State. The Governorship zoning system that has been working for us is on senatorial basis. The central has gone, which is Chief James Ibori, Delta South has gone, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan and today our son, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa is on the saddle.

“When we were going round to canvass for support in 2015 for Delta North, our campaign was based on senatorial district. Today Delta North, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa is now the Governor, which by God’s grace his tenure will end in a year time.

“For somebody from Delta North to say he wants to be governor after Senator Ifeanyi Okowa is wrong, not that the person does not have the constitutional right, but is going to be a fruitless effort because the person will end up wasting his money. We Delta Northerners know that is our son that is occupying that position now.

“In Anioma Congress, we have the political class, we have the traditional rulers class and the business class. Our political class and business class have not come to us the traditional rulers to say there is a change in the zoning pattern. Even our son, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has not come to us to say there is a different arrangement apart from the senatorial zoning which we have been using.

“Since they have not come to us to say otherwise, the status quo remains, which means the senatorial district zoning arrangement is what we will still maintain. I, therefore, call on Urhobo people, which is Delta Central to be steadfast and put their house together.

“I congratulate DC-23 for being able to prune the aspirants to three. Any of these persons, Olorogun David Edevbie, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi and Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori are all qualified to be Governor. I have known these three persons very well.”

Earlier in his remarks, National Chairman of DC-23, Senator Ighoyota Amori solicited the support of the Delta North Traditional Rulers, arguing that it was the turn of the Delta Central Senatorial District to produce the next Governor.

Amori said Delta Central have waited for 16 years, adding that it was only proper to allow them to come in after Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.

He maintained that zoning along ethnic nationality was not practicable, saying that the state was made up of seven ethnic groups.

Jafaru Mohammed: EFCC denies its official stole N10.9bn from NIA funds found in Ikoyi,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied the “theft” of N10.9 billion belonging to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) by its official.

On April 12, 2017, the EFCC uncovered about $43.5 million, £27,800 and N23.2 million inside Apartment 7B, Osborne Towers in Ikoyi, Lagos.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo chaired a presidential investigation committee that grilled the sacked NIA DG, Ayo Oke, ex-EFCC chairman Ibrahim Magu, among others.

A Brigadier General, Jafaru Mohammed, is accused of stealing a chunk of the money to purchase properties now forfeited to the Federal Government.

Mohammed is currently the Director of Finance and Administration, Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA).

In 2017, the senior officer was appointed by Magu to oversee the N13 billion found in Ikoyi. The EFCC was then in charge of NIA bank accounts.

In a statement at the weekend, EFCC Head of Media, Wilson Uwujaren said Mohammed was not its staff.

The spokesman noted that the claim was false and intended to mislead the public.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC has no accountant by name, Jafaru Mohammed and could not have appointed him to serve in another agency.

“It is infantile to suggest that the Commission would appoint an accountant for the National Intelligence Agency, NIA, which is not a department of the EFCC.”

After Abdulrasheed Bawa assumed office last year, the EFCC secured an interim forfeiture order on assets linked to Mohammed.

In March 2021, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo of the Federal High Court in Abuja, in suit FHC/ABJ/CS/007/2021, directed the seal of the properties.

A House on Plot 7, God’s Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; a plot at Kubwa Express, opposite Abuja Model City Gate; a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.

Others are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.

On February 14, 2022, Justice N. E. Maha of the Federal High Court in Abuja granted final forfeiture after an application by EFCC lawyers, Cosmos Ugwu and Musa Isah.

Additional properties seized include a Truck Assembly at Ring Road, adjacent to A A Affa Filling Station, Kano; Marhaba Event Place, Guda Abdullahi Road, Kano.

A plot located at Rake, adjacent to Dara Orthopedic Hospital, Kano; 117 hectares of land at Adiabo, Oduapani LG, Calabar, with Certificated of Occupancy No. OD/23/2011 dated 21/2/ 2011.

Announcing the court ruling, the EFCC concealed Mohammed’s name but mentioned his accomplices.

The proxies include the late General Maude Aminun-Kano, Atlasfield Integrated Services Nigeria Limited, Marhaba Events Place, Aflac Plastics and Atlasfield Gas Plant Limited.

In August 2017, the citizens that provided intelligence on the NIA funds petitioned the Attorney General and Justice Minister, Abubakar Malami.

The claimants, through their solicitors, accused the EFCC of failing to pay their whistleblower commission.","The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied the “theft” of N10.9 billion belonging to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) by its official.

Army charges officers to stick to virtue of loyalty as 295 cadets pass out,"The Nigeria Army has charged the 295 cadets of Short Service Course (SSC) 47 to uphold the symbol of loyalty as they are posted to their respective places of assignment.

Major General Anthony Omozoje, Chief of Policy and Plans Nigerian Army, gave the charge during the dinner in honour of 295 cadets of short service officers from the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna.

According to him, the academy has provided them with an adequate training that would enable them to discharge their duties effectively, as all eyes are on them to prove their worth to the service of their fatherland.

He said as officers, they should be loyal to their superior and refrain from any form of criminality, adding that anyone found wanting will be shown the way out.

“They must be loyal to the service, they must remain loyal to this nation. They should be committed to their assignment, that is what is required,” he said.

He added that it’s only when they stay committed to their duties, they would get to the peak of their careers, adding that Nigerians await to see officers who demonstrate good character, defend the nation and work assiduously to ensure the protection of lives and property.

He further informed them that in a few days, they will end a phase and begin another as transition from being cadets to commissioned officers of the Nigerian Army.

Omozoje noted that officers are essential to the army organization to command, establish policy and manage resources while balancing risk and caring for the people and families, adding that they need a correct sense of responsibility, coupled with the right knowledge.

He told them to submit to civil requirements for leadership development that will enable them to contribute to the development and effectiveness of the Nigerian Army in accomplishing tasks in support of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the constitution.

“Hence, you must be leaders who are physically and mentally fit, highly motivated and disciplined, willing to share in the hardship, danger and inspire your men to follow you even into the darkest of places,” he said.","The Nigeria Army has charged the 295 cadets of Short Service Course (SSC) 47 to uphold the symbol of loyalty as they are posted to their respective places of assignment.

"Nwoba: Saraki wants PDP spokesman released, blasts Ebonyi govt, Ebube Agu","Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged the police to release Chika Nwoba, Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State.

Saraki also lambasted the Governor Dave Umahi-led government, noting that “act of injustice” is being “promoted and foisted by those in power in Ebonyi.”

A statement by his media office at the weekend decried the spokesman’s arrest for “circulating false information.”

Saraki condemned the brutality by Ebube Agu, the security outfit which picked Nwoba before the intervention of the police.

A situation where a citizen was suddenly seized, beaten to a stupor and detained for several weeks, “is an assault on democracy”, he said.

The former Kwara State Governor expressed disappointment that injustice has transcended every facet of the country.

Insisting Nwoba deserves the right to fair hearing, Saraki said he has been controversially remanded after an arrest which started like a kidnap.

“He has been prevented from meeting any member of his family. My sympathy goes out to his wife and kids who must be going through a tough time at the moment.

“Mr Nwoba is a dutiful member of our great party, PDP, and he is paying the price of speaking truth to power.

“Without any doubt, this is another concerted effort to silence the opposition and undermine democracy.

“This act of injustice being promoted and foisted by those in power in Ebonyi, is nothing but an assault on our democracy and our freedom as citizens because an injury to one is an injury to all.

“This is a time for every well meaning Nigerian and most especially the leaders of our party, the PDP, to stand up and stand with one of our own.”

Saraki told the public that Nigeria must be saved from the misfortune wreaked by injustice and miscarriage of justice.

The former SP added that with the case in a Magistrate court, he hopes justice will be dispensed promptly and without any delay.

In late January, the PDP accused Umahi of unleashing terror on its members and other dissenting voices.

Umahi “is using a heavily armed killer squad, disguising under the Ebube Agu security outfit, as a political weapon”, said National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.","Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged the police to release Chika Nwoba, Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State.

CSOs mobilise for national protest over delay in assenting to Electoral Act Amendment Bill,"The continuous delay by President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is brewing a social crisis, as a coalition of civil society organisations has fixed February 22nd to stage a national protest.

No fewer than 26 Civil Society Organisations are currently mobilising for the protest, DAILY POST has learnt.

The move according to them is intended to mount further pressure on the presidency to do the needful and sign the amended bill into law.

Some of the prominent CSOs spoiling for a protest are Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre, Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organizations (NNNGO) among others.

Their concerns stem from insinuations that the delay in granting presidential assent to the Electoral Bill, 2022 may create legal uncertainties that will threaten the integrity of the off-cycle elections in Ekiti, Osun, including the 2023 general election, which is only 366 days away.

They are amazed why the President, despite giving assurance that he would sign once the direct primary clause is expunged from the Bill, is still withholding his assent even after the National Assembly has complied with his directive.

They took to a statement on Saturday to state their grievances, saying, “aware that on the 31st January 2022, the National Assembly transmitted the Electoral Bill 2022 to the President for assent after expeditiously reworking the bill to meet the President’s expectations. Also, aware the bill allows electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC’s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.

“Further aware, the bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.

“The civil society community resolves to declare Tuesday, 22nd February 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill. Civil society networks will organize peaceful public direct-action activities to further the demand to assent the bill.

“We urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance”.","The continuous delay by President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is brewing a social crisis, as a coalition of civil society organisations has fixed February 22nd to stage a national protest.

APC primary: Aregbesola tells members to move against violence,"Minister of Interior Ogbeno Rauf Aregbesola has appelaed to members of the All Progressives Congress(APC) to prevent violence and thuggery in the ongoing governorship primary.

He specifically told women to lead the voting process to prevent attacks by thugs during the exercise.

Aregbesola, who has mounted stiff opposition to the second term bid of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, in a statement he personally signed, appealed to members of the party to conduct themselves peacefully.

According to him: “This electoral cycle is a two-staged process. The first is intra-party, meaning that our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), will democratically nominate its candidate. The second stage, inter-party, will take place in a state-wide election sometime in July, God willing.

“I am appealing to all our party members to participate but peacefully in the primary election taking place today. They should avoid any form of violence, brigandage and disorderliness.

“Our party members, especially our supporters, should be resolute to cast their vote, not to be intimidated and scared away.

“But they should portray themselves and the party in the best form in comportment, organisation and promotion of societal peace and tranquillity.

“I am also appealing to our members to push out the women and let them lead the process by coming out decently and peacefully.

“This is to demonstrate the customary dignity of women as matriarchs, mothers, wives and daughters, which confers on them the special protection status from violent attacks from thugs and hoodlums.

Our overall objective is to have a transparent, free, fair and peaceful election.

Nineteen-year-old Collins Sambaya was found in the morning nailed to a tree in his Izava Village in Vihiga County, on Friday. February 18, 2022.

The incident brought Izava Village to a standstill, with shocked and distraught villagers watching in disbelief from a distance as officers rescued Sambaya and rushed him to a hospital.

According to the DCI, a manhunt has been launched for the suspects “with the area security team employing every available resource to apprehend the suspects.”

Vihiga County is an administrative region in the former Western Province of Kenya.

It has a population of 554,622 and an area of 563 km². Vihiga County was split from Kakamega County in 1990.

Shocked Kenyans poured their anger on social media called for the arrest of the perpetrators.

Writing on Facebook, Nicholas Odhiambo Odwar said: “What happened to our humanity? We’ve lost it all. Why, why should people be this cruel?

“A 19-yr old does not have a fully developed mind, he only needs the society to guide him. But what does society do? Turn against each other, we are filled with anger and hatred for one another.

“We are our own enemy. Such a sickening world.”

Eboko Rashid said: “This is too barbaric, diabolical, vexatious, irksome and obnoxious. I mean there is no amount of anger that can warrant such an evil act. The moral fiber of our society has greatly degenerated. This is pathetic, to say the least. The perpetrators MUST face the long arm of the law. What a shame!”

Kipkirui Raymond agreed. He said: “Indeed. So sad. Crucifiers must be brought to book for such inhuman crucifixion act.”

Kyle Knick also condemned the act. He said:”Surely.. How hard was it to take him to a police station and report him… Dear Lord have mercy on our societies.. So sad indeed.. It doesn’t matter what he did wrong, there is a way and a right and humane way of doing things…”

Ferdinand Makokha said: “19 years old, thus just a boy who is in exploration and passing a stage. Support them the right way without physically, emotionally or psychologically torturing or tormenting them but mentoring them to become responsible citizens of this great country.”

Kiriungi Njogu Ke said: “Ngai mwathani! This is sad, wrong, evil and the saddest thing that can happen to anyone. This is cruel and so hurting. No matter the crime, this one has gone overboard. Humans are dangerous. Animals have fewer brains but can not behave like this. Am so teary. May justice prevail.”

Jubilation in Nassarawa as NDPHC adds 240MW,"The Nasarawa State Governor, Engr. Abdullahi Sule, has said there are jubilations across Nasarawa State over the recently energised Lafia 2X150 MVA & 2X60 /132/33/330 KV Transmission Substation that will add 240Mw to their supply.

It was earlier completed by Niger Delta Power Holding Company Limited (NDPHC).

President Muhamadu Buhari is scheduled to formally commission the substation on Thursday next week.

Head, Communication & Public Relations, Mr. Emmanuel Ojor, revealed this in a press release at the weekend.

Speaking during a pre-commissioning inspection to the Substation by the Executive Director, Networks, NDPHC Limited, Engr. Ifeoluwa Oyedele and his team on Tuesday, Engr. Sule, who was represented by his deputy, Dr. Emmanuel Akabe, said with the completion of the substation has come “praise galore for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari across the state.”

He thanked President Buhari, the management and staff of NDPHC, and all those involved in the execution of the project, stressing that it will definitely improve the economy of Nasarawa State.

“Small, medium, and micro enterprises will all thrive because they need energy,” he said.

Earlier, Oyedele had commended the Governor and his predecessor, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura for their doggedness in the pursuit for the development of their State.

He said, although the National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP), Lafia Substation was funded by the Federation, it was important to emphasise the contributions of Engr. Sule and his predecessor.

“On the day that we came to take over this site, a Certificate of Occupancy had been issued. In three years, no worker – whether expatriate or local has been harassed – not to talk of being kidnapped or any such thing.

“And since the incumbent Governor took over, he has assumed the role of Project Manager. He has visited this site more than 33 times. He is purely showing good example. To see a Governor who is interested in the progress and development of his people, is commendable. I remember that he visited the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), the Nigeria Customs Service and the Federal Ministry of Finance to facilitate the early release of imported materials for the project when their clearance was being delayed. If all Nigerians are like this, this country would be a better place.”

The Lafia Transmission Substation is equipped with State-of-the-Art Digital Control and Protection facilities with fully functional Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) that enhances real-time operational flexibility, monitoring & control of all the substation electrical variables.

The project will also help to provide back feed to the FCT, whenever necessary since FCT is being served from Shiroro and Geregu Power Stations.","The Nasarawa State Governor, Engr.

Gombe community leaders call for investigation into causes of communal crisis,"Leaders of Lunguda Communities of Nyuwar and Jessu in Balanga Local Government Area of Gombe State on Friday called for in-depth investigation into causes of recurring attacks on their communities by neighbouring Waja communities, despite various peace initiatives.

The District Head of Nyuwar, Chief James Pisaghi and the Village Head of Sabon Layi in Jessu, Mr. Busa Zwaye who made the call during an advocacy visit facilitated by West African Network for Peace building, WANEP in collaboration with Kebetkache Women Development and Resource Centre from Port Harcourt, Rivers State and Humanity First Nigeria in Gombe, said this has become imperative in order to find a lasting solution.

The two traditional rulers lamented that despite the intervention by both Gombe and Adamawa states governments, peace has continued to elude the two communities, leading to over one thousand Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, scattered in neighbouring communities of Cham, Bambam and Yolde.

The District Head of Nyuwar, Chief James Pisaghi, who was a former Secretary to Gombe State Government, said various peace negotiations/mediations, meetings, dialogues held and agreements signed would continue to be ignored and attacks would continue unless the matter was traced to its roots.

Pisaghi said the recent attack on Nyuwar on the 8th of February, 2022, came to them as a surprised, because they thought they had found a solution to the main cause of the crisis between the Lunguda and Waja speaking communities with the renewed interactions between them which had cooled tempers.

He said his people remained grateful to the various interventions from outside their communities, but that the interventions were mere scratches on the surface, unless the real reasons for the attacks were known.

“My own understanding of the crisis is that, I think it’s being brushed on the surface. We have not gone deep into it to know what the real causes, immediate and remote are.” he said.

The Village Head of Sabon Layi, Mr. Busa Zwaye, said his community was hosting about a thousand displaced people from Nyuwar, who were attacked on Tuesday last week, 8th of February, 2022.

He wondered how the two tribes who had lived together for over 300 years suddenly turned to sworn enemies.

The National Coordinator of WANEP, Mrs. Bridget Osakwe, said the most strategic move by both leaders of the Lunguda and Waja Communities should be the physical demonstration of forgiveness and the show of unity by them, so that the followership can naturally emulate it.

After the April 2021 attack both Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State and his Adamawa state counterpart brought the two tribes leaders to sign a peace accord at Numa in Adamawa state but the attack continued especially on Nyuwar and Jessu communities unabated.","Leaders of Lunguda Communities of Nyuwar and Jessu in Balanga Local Government Area of Gombe State on Friday called for in-depth investigation into causes of recurring attacks on their communities by neighbouring Waja communities, despite various peace initiatives.

"Nigerian airlines increase cost of economy flight tickets to N50,000","By Chinelo Obogo

Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have resolved to increase the cost of economy flight tickets to a minimum of N50, 000 nationwide, Saturday Sun has learned.

At a meeting held in Lagos which had most of the domestic operators present, the association cited the high cost of jet A1 fuel, forex scarcity, double digit inflation, increase in ground handling charges, cost of buying and importation of spare parts among others as reasons for the increase.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Saturday Sun gathered that at the meeting, when the issue of increment was raised, most of the operators were in agreement that the benchmark for economy ticket should be pegged at N50, 000 to most routes but that Green Africa, whose business model is that of a low cost carrier was not in total support. Saturday Sun can also confirm that the increment has already taken effect as a visit to the website of many of the airlines show that economy tickets now sell for N50, 000. At the time of filing this report, economy tickets from Lagos to Abuja which used to cost between N29, 000 and N35, 000, now cost N50, 000. The websites of Dana Air, United Nigeria, Azman Air, Air Peace and Max Air show that economy tickets from Lagos to Abuja are from N50,000. Ibom Air sells for N53,00 and Aero Contractors which used to sell for N26,000 is now N48,365, while Arik Air is N48,500. However, Green Africa, which used to sell for N20, 000 is now selling at N39, 000, excluding cost of baggage.

On Thursday, February 17, Air Peace, United Nigeria and Dana Air sold economy tickets to Owerri from Lagos for less than N30, 000 but at the time of filing this report, economy tickets to the same routes now sells for N50, 000.

At a recent meeting with aviation reporters in Lagos, the Chief Executive Officer of United Nigeria Airline hinted at the possibility of increasing flight tickets due to the high cost of operations. He said that a year ago, aviation fuel was sold at N190 per litre, but that the cost has risen to N400 per litre and that considering the fact that fuel takes up at least 30 per cent of operation cost, many airlines will struggle if there is no price adjustment.

“The least ticket we sold a year ago was N23, 000 when aviation fuel was N190 and the official rate of naira to a dollar then was N340, but today, if forex is available, it is N450 but when it is not available, the alternative market is N570 to a dollar. Despite this, you can still buy your ticket at N20, 000 to N21, 000 and what this means is that as long as all the airlines are buying from the same market and selling tickets at the current rates, any ticket that you buy is being subsidised by the airlines. Why did I say this? aviation fuel, depending on the aircraft type you are flying, could take up to about 30 to 40 per cent of your cost components.

“As you know, for every ticket you sell, you give five per cent of Ticket Sales Charge (TSC) to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), you have other deductions to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and to other airport owners. As a matter of fact, by the time you remove these deductions from the N20, 000 that you charge, you have to use your money to take care of other operational needs.

“In year 2000, you may have bought an air ticket at N2,000, which was about $100 then and 99 per cent of aviation component is foreign exchange denominated. From that N2, 000 up till now, the cost of aircraft has not reduced, salaries to staff have increased, the landing charges and other charges have increased, yet this item of ticket remains same. Safety is very critical in aviation business, but you cannot deal with safety in isolation of efficient operations. It must come with proper financing of your operations. The cost of tickets is very important, yet aviation is a chain and the airline operators are at the centre of the chain. However, there is need to establish a better customer service with operators,” Okonkwo said.","By Chinelo ObogoAirline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have resolved to increase the cost of economy flight tickets to a minimum of N50, 000 nationwide, Saturday Sun has learned.

"ACJA Amendment: Kalu’s bill gets accolades, inputs at public hearing","From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja

A bill for the amendment of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) to create a criminal justice administration legislation that is more effective and humane has been commended by stakeholders, including government agencies and civil rights organisations, among others.

The bill is sponsored by Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu. While applauding the motive of the bill and its sponsor, stakeholders at Wednesday’s public hearing also presented their recommendations to some provisions of sections of the proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The public hearing of the bill entitled, ‘Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (SB: 465) organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters; and Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, had several Federal Government security agencies in attendance. They include the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS), the Nigerian Navy, National Security Adviser (NSA), Nigerian Immigration Services (NIS), Nigerian Air Force (NAF), the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and others.

In his presentation on the legislative proposals, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya commended the motive. He however sought the replacement of some words in Section 14 (3) of the ACJA. General Yahaya who was represented by the Nigerian Army’s Director of Legal Services, Major Mahmood Wambai, suggested that the words “shall be done in the presence of” in Section 14(3) of ACJA should be replaced with “may be done within the sighting distance of.

He stressed that this would give the detaining officer the power to determine the circumstances to permit unrestricted communication between the detainee and any other person.

He added that it would also aid the use of eavesdropping devices during such communications. He said: “The circumstances here could include the nature of the allegation against the detainee, his/her criminal history and the status of the visitor.” On the amendment to Section 17, subsection 3, the Army opposed the inclusion of a new paragraph which reads “such an interpreter shall be at the instance and choice of the suspect held in custody.”

The Army held that it is always the constitutional responsibility of the state to provide an interpreter in all proceedings where a suspect does not understand the language of the court, stressing that the responsibility should not be shifted to the suspect who could end up choosing an interpreter that may do his/her biddings.

Making further recommendations the Nigerian Army also sought another inclusion to the proposed amendment to Section 172 of ACJA which seeks to add the words; “either orally or by a motion on notice “ before the words; “on application to court “. The Army suggested that the following words could be added; “subject to the discretion of the Judge” after the proposed amendment. This according to the COAS will confer on the judge the powers to direct that such application shall be on notice in appropriate cases.

Lauding the initiative to amend the ACJA, the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen Babagana Monguno described the amendment as a welcome development. He was represented by his spokesperson, Zakari Usman. The Nigerian Correctional Service in a submission by its Controller-General, Haliru Nababa applauded the proposed legislative amendment to the ACJA. In its submission the NCS agreed with the amendments Sections 8(4), 14, 17, and 162.

Haliru, who was represented by a top official of the NCS at the public hearing, however opposed the amendments to Sections 223 and Section 229. He maintained that the section does not infringe on the principle of fair hearing. He said: “It does not in any way make the hearing time unreasonable, and has not interfered with the independence and impartiality of a court or other tribunal established by law.”

On its part, the Nigerian Navy disagreed with the deletion of Paragraph 6 section 223 and 229.

Chief of Naval Staff , Vice Admiral AZ Gambo, who was represented by Navy’s Director of Admin, Rear Admiral Kennedy Egbuchulam stated that the section of the ACJA proposed to be deleted has similar provisions in Sections 226(6) and 142 of the Penal Code Act and Armed Forces Act Laws of the Federation of Nigeria respectively.

The paragraph 6 of the bill is seeking to delete the provisions of Sections 223 and 229 of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015. It reads that: “Where a defendant is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he committed a similar offence with which he might have been charged under the provisions of this Act, he may be convicted of the offence, which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it,” and “where a defendant is charged with an offence relating to property and the evidence establishes the commission by him with respect to the same property of another offence, he may be convicted of that other offence although he was not charged with it.”

According to the Nigerian Navy, the intention of the above provisions is that an accused person can be convicted for similar or kindred offences based on evidence on record. Gambo said the extant provisions of the ACJA which was being proposed for deletion do not constitute a breach of the right of fair hearing of an accused person.

Rendering special commendations to the bill’s sponsor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Centre for Socio-Legal Studies described the proposed amendments sought by the bill as highly laudable and commendable.

In a speech read by the centre’s President, Prof Yemi Akinseye – George (SAN), he said the bill’s amendment would address the emerging developments and judicial pronouncements on some of the provisions of the extant Act “as it is intended to address the aspect of concern noticed in the course of implementing the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015.”

Earlier in his remarks, sponsor of the bill and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, said the legislative proposal seeks to amend in the Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2015, the sections contradicting the principles of fair hearing and court jurisdiction as provided in the Constitution. This, he said, is to avert some loggerheads between the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and the constitution.

Kalu, who was represented at the event by Senator Abdu Kwari, maintained that the nation’s constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Kalu emphasised that in line with the provision of the constitution, all authorities in Nigeria shall conform to the constitutional provision.

“Therefore the Administration of Criminal Justice Act shall conform with the supreme provision of the 1999 Constitution as amended.

“Each legal norm of the society derives its validity from the basic norm. Any other law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution must give way or abate.”

“The court has also held that- ‘The constitution of a nation is the ‘fons et origo’ not only of the jurisprudence but also of the legal system,” Kalu said. The former governor of Abia State said the various High Court Rules and Court of Appeal Rules have provisions with regards to the position of pending cases when judges are elevated, adding that more often the position is for the matter to start de novo.

He added that although the constitution says in Section 252(2) that the National Assembly will by law make provision conferring upon the Federal High Court additional powers to those conferred by the Constitution, there exists a lacuna in respect of the position of an elevated judge from the High Court to the Court of Appeal (that is there is a gap that needs to be filled).

Said he: “It will be advisable that the Act be amended to expressly handle the gap created when judges are elevated to the next bench, by being given the right or powers to conclude part-heard cases before moving to the next level.

“Our judicial system recognizes and applies the rule of stare decisis, meaning rules of precedent and hierarchy of courts. More so, our courts are classified according to the constitution and other extant laws. We should clearly demarcate or clearly spell out jurisdiction of court to avoid contradiction and uncertainty.”

Explaining further, the Senate Chief Whip reiterated the aspiration of the legislative amendment to create a criminal justice administration legislation that is both more effective and more humane.

His words: “By ‘more effective,’ I mean that we should respond to crime in ways that produce socially desirable results—greater safety, less fear, less suffering, greater respect for the rule of law and less injustice—and that we do so efficiently, investing our precious financial and human resources in ways that maximize the results we desire.

“By ‘more humane,’ I mean we should respond to crime in ways that recognize the humanity of those victimized by crime, those arrested and convicted of crime, and others who experience the ripple effects of crime and our justice system. This affirmation of humanity, as I see it, incorporates values we hold dear in our democracy, such as equal protection of the laws, access to the rights guaranteed by our constitution, and our fundamental belief in the dignity of the individual.”

The ACJA Amendment Bill passed First Reading on June 30 2020. It also passed the Second Reading on December 8 2020.","While applauding the motive of the bill and its sponsor, stakeholders at Wednesday’s public hearing also presented their recommendations to some provisions of sections of the proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act.
The public hearing of the bill entitled, ‘Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (SB: 465) organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters; and Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, had several Federal Government security agencies in attendance.
The paragraph 6 of the bill is seeking to delete the provisions of Sections 223 and 229 of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015.
This, he said, is to avert some loggerheads between the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and the constitution.

"Osun APC primary: Aregbesola, Oyetola know fate today","From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo

It is bound to be a battle of the titans as the state’s All Progressives Congress (APC) holds its primary election today. The soul of the party is being fought for between Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior, and the fourth civilian governor of Osun State, and the current Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, who also doubles as his successor.

The earth is literally going to shake as supporters of Aregbesola, and Oyetola who is seeking for a re-election to which his predecessor is vehemently opposed seek to outdo each other at the polls. Already, Aregbesola has urged the party faithful in the state to come out in their thousands to ensure that his anointed candidate, Moshood Adeoti, emerges the party’s chosen one. But in a related development, a faction of the party loyal to him has raised the alarm over alleged plan by Oyetola to rig the election.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Its governorship aspirant of the party and the former Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti who addressed a press conference in Osogbo yesterday faulted Governor Oyetola’s membership of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (NCECPC) of APC till date.

He said the governor’s failure to resign from the committee was as a result of his influence that he claimed was against the party’s constitution, adding that the governor would use the advantage over him in the primary election.

He said: “In the spirit of fair play, objectivity and natural justice, Governor Oyetola is not supposed to remain in the membership of the NCECPC. What we are witnessing is a case of a thief adjudicating in his own case. He can never convict himself. Governor Oyetola’s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if it is allowed to pass us by. We put on record, the fact that The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of APC to which I belong, has not been availed with the membership register of the party, which will be the basis of voting. We put on record that there ought to have been display of party register, with claims and objections made before we go into voting.

“We recall that TOP had reported the abuse and manipulation to which the party’s register had been subjected to while being compiled by Governor Oyetola and his cabinet members. And this allegation was unattended to, but cannot be wished away. We state that if there is no deliberate attempt to manipulate the primary process, it is important to make the membership register available, display it for claims and objections before using it for the primary election. The APC, we say with confidence, will not want to involve itself in a muddled-up arrangement that could tarnish its democratic image.”

But in his reaction to Adeoti’s allegations, the APC’s Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Mr Kunle Oyatomi noted that Aregbesola/Adeoti’s faction of the party are crying wolf where there is none. He added that Governor Oyetola is a peace-loving person who would not encourage violence of any kind in any issue that involves members of his party.

He said that the Osun Progressives (TOP) which Adeoti referred to has no locus standi as the only recognized leadership of the APC in the state is under the chairmanship of Prince Gboyega Famodun while Governor Oyetola is the leader of the party. He promised that the primary election would be free and fair, assuring that the Governor or any leader of the party would not interfere in the exercise.

Oyatomi who said there was no cause for the alarm regarding the primary election, like Aregbesola earlier did, called on members of the APC across the state to troop out in large numbers and assemble at their wards’ voting centres throughout the state from 8.00am today to participate fully in the direct primary.

The party’s spokesman said that the APC’s candidate for the July 16 governorship election will be elected by all card-carrying members of the party and urged them not to be scared by rumours of violence and attack. He also advised to comport themselves orderly, peacefully and responsibly in order to ensure a successful election.","From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, OsogboIt is bound to be a battle of the titans as the state’s All Progressives Congress (APC) holds its primary election today.

"War in Osun as Oyetola, Adeoti, Battle for APC’s Guber Ticket Today","*Governor AbdulRazaq heads 7-man election supervision team, says he’ll be fair to all

Bennett Oghifo in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo

Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and the Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, who is Oyetola’s predecessor, will today go to war, as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) holds direct primary elections across the 322 wards in the state to pick its candidate for the governorship election holding next July.

The Osun State Governor and Aregbesola have been at loggerheads for almost three years, over the control of the state and the party.

Oyetola is seeking the party’s ticket to run for a second term while Aregbesola and his political movement, The Osun Progressives (TOP) are backing erstwhile Secretary to the Osun State Government, Moshood Adeoti to unseat Oyetola.

Many agree that Oyetola has performed creditably well since he assumed office despite the mountain of debt left behind by Aregbesola.

Aside the power of incumbency, as well as his achievements in the past three and half years in office, Oyetola enjoys the support of former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the national leadership of the party and the backing of the State Executive of the party, led by Adegboyega Famodun.

But Aregbesloa insists Oyetola must not get the party’s ticket to run for a second term because the governor has been disloyal to him and the party members in the state.

The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party has sent a seven-man team led by Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State to supervise today’s primary in the state. Senator Julius Ucha is the Secretary of the committee.

Other members of the committee are Senator Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe, Hon. Abdulkarim Abdulraman, Hon. Wale Raji, Mrs. Yetunde Imolehin and Mr. Ofonmbuk Okon Bassey.

There were moves by some chieftains of the party to postpone the primary in order to address the rift between Oyetola and Aregbesola, but the national body resisted the moves.

Incidentally, AbdulRazaq has been engaged in a feud with the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, just like the case between Oyetola and Aregbesola.

But AbdulRazaq promised all contestants that he would be fair to them in the conduct of the primary election.

He said he would act in strict compliance with APC’s Constitution in the conduct of the election.

The governor said he and other members of the panel on the Osun primary were looking forward to conducting a free and fair primary election in the state.

Oyetola has persistently resisted Aregbesola’s moves to operate as the Godfather of Osun State politics and dictate to him as the governor, on the day to day running of the state.

This has resulted in numerous violent clashes among supporters of the two camps.

The Special Adviser to Oyetola on Political Affairs, Sunday Akere, explains further: “Oyetola did not fight Aregbesola. He (Aregbesola) declared that Oyetola’s tenure was his third term and he wanted to be in charge. He also promised those close to him that 80 per cent of them would return as cabinet members, which did not happen. The ex-governor thought the eight-year tenure was for eternity. It has ended but he could not believe that reality. The root cause of the issue is what I just said.”

The Chairman, Elders’ Caucus of the Osun State APC, Sola Akinwumi described the “street shows” by Aregbesola as a display of thuggery and hooliganism.

Akinwumi adds: “As a matter of fact, the erstwhile governor belittles himself and I am very sure he didn’t know the implications of what he did. He acted so low and naively as if he was the sitting governor.

“Was he telling us that there are two governors in the State? Has he forgotten that he is no longer a Governor? We have known his intention and we leave everyone to his or her conscience.”

Meanwhile, members of the APC in Osun State have been urged to remain focused and resolute in their resolve to re-elect Oyetola at the party’s primary election coming up today, as they have demonstrated during the strategic tour conducted round the state.

The Secretary to the State Government, Prince Oluwole Oyebamiji gave the charge in a press statement, describing the atmosphere of tension recently created in the State as a mere distraction.

The SSG affirmed in the statement that Osun “is the most peaceful state and will remain so during and after the primary election.”

He then urged every member of the public to embrace peace and go about their lawful duties without any fear.

The statement further revealed that the Oyetola administration had touched lives and impacted the society in an unprecedented way without relegating human capital development to the background.

Aregbesola: Oyetola Waging War against Me

On the other hand, Aregbesola alleged that Oyetola had been waging a war against him since becoming the governor.

The Interior Minister reiterated this in Ikire town last Thursday while addressing a rally held to garner support for Adeoti, his anointed candidate in today’s primaries.

Speaking in Yoruba, Aregbesola said he pleaded with Oyetola for about two years not to fight him, adding that his successor rejected his advice, which made him call his supporters to salvage the party.

He said, “I begged him (Oyetola) for two years; I told him that people must not mock us; I told him that he was heading for destruction. I served this state with the whole of my heart; I also positioned Oyetola so that he could succeed me in office.

“When we came to this town (Ikire) for his campaign, we were drenched in rain from the Akire’s palace to this place. He got to the office and claimed I am his enemy; those who contested against him during our party primary he pulled closer, while he is fighting me.

“Since Oyetola assumed office, he has waged a war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as the governor; I told him that I heard him and that now that he had been governor, what else did he want?

“I begged him for two years; I sent people to help me beg him and that he should not love me, but he must not fight me; even if he wanted to fight me, he should not abuse me and destroy my legacies.

“All that I warned him not to do was what he did. He opposed what I did; all the things I did together with him for eight years, he opposed and reversed them. He thought he could destroy me through my work; nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately towed that path. He waged a war against me and refused to listen to my pleas until he got rid of me.”

Sack Aregbesola Now, Coalition Tells Buhari

Meanwhile, a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations in Osun State has demanded the sack of Aregbesola for promoting civil unrest ahead of today’s governorship primary election.

The Spokesperson of the Coalition, Mr. Wasiu Alli, while addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, said according to the 5th Schedule of the constitution, Aregbesola was expected to act only in ways that promote National Security and does not expose Nigerians anywhere to threats to their lives and property.

The Coalition added that where the contrary becomes the case, erring government officials must receive appropriate sanctions.

The coalition said Aregbesola in the past one week had engaged in a public show of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the State, denigration of Elder Statesmen, among many others.

It noted that the recent utterances of Aregbesola were already heating the polity in the State to a point where residents now live in fear.

It stated: “While superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies (NSCDC and NPF) into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.

“Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, despite being responsible for coordination of public security, is, by his actions, promoting disunity and insubordination between two key security agencies that should ordinarily be cooperating. This portends grave danger for the maintenance of peace and security within Osun State and indeed, Nigeria.”

The coalition said if the federal government failed to call Aregbesola to order and charge him to focus on his official responsibilities instead of going about causing civil unrest, he would end up inflaming the otherwise peaceful Osun State.

It said, “Where he cannot be cautioned, we demand his outright sack or redeployment if he cannot act responsibly in line with the dictates of the office he presently holds. A public officer must never be seen acting contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.”

Responding, Aregbesola said the Coalition was hurriedly put together and plotted by the leadership of the government in Osun State.

The minister, who responded in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, insisted that the state government in particular had mounted a campaign of calumny against the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) because they were providing security for some citizens in Osun while they hold meetings and ward off attacks against them.

You Have Been Chosen to Rule Osun for Second Term, Ataoja, Olobu Tell Oyetola

The Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Oyetunji Olanipekun, and the Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, yesterday reiterated their support for Governor Oyetola, saying they were resolute to work for his success in the forthcoming governorship election.

The monarchs showered encomiums and prayers on the governor for his modest achievements in the last three years, just as they assured him of their royal backing before, during and after the July 16 governorship election in the State.

This is even as Oyetola rounded off his strategic engagement tour across the nine Federal Constituencies of the State in Osogbo, the State capital, on Thursday night.

Oyetola had in the last three weeks embarked on a familiarisation visit to each of the 30 local government areas, including Ife-East Area Office, to identify and solidarise with the newly-elected executives of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State.

Receiving the Governor in his palace, the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, threw his weight behind Governor Oyetola whom he described as a promise keeper.

In the same vein, Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, acknowledged the monumental achievements of the Administration of Governor Oyetola, which he described as unprecedented in the history of the State.

Oba Olaniyan, who implored the Governor to remain steadfast and not be distracted, said, “We are solidly behind you and we are ready to mobilise our subjects to re-elect you.”

APC Set to Postpone National Convention by Two Weeks,"Caretaker Committee to meet President for approval

By Adedayo Akinwale

The National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 may not be held on that day after all.

THISDAY can authoritatively confirm that the convention will be postponed by two weeks.

Efforts to speak to the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, who is also the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, on this latest development proved abortive.

Though there is no formal announcement yet, a very reliable party source informed THISDAY last night that the (CECPC) and the APC governors would meet President Muhammadu Buhari today to propose a new date, which is likely to be March 12.

The source who preferred anonymity said, “The convention has been postponed by two weeks but it is not official yet. The Caretaker Committee and the governors will meet with the President on Saturday (today) to propose the new date.”

Also, a former member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who pleaded for anonymity, said it was already clear that the convention would not hold, “because there are some things that needed to be done for the convention to hold as scheduled on February 26 and most of them had not been done, with few days to February 26.”

The source stressed that, for instance, one of the things that ought to have been done was zoning of party offices.

He continued: “People have not bought forms and people cannot buy form if the zoning is not done; and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don’t know the zoning, you can’t buy a form.

“There are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. I remember that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees beside the main convention committee.”

Reacting to the purported plans by some governors and a principal officer in the Senate to foist Senator Abdulahi Adamu on the party, he said “while individuals or groups can have preference, President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who becomes the next Chairman of the party.

“Whatever you are hearing now are mere speculations because nobody can push anybody. All of them are waiting for the president. Everybody is waiting for the president and that is why until the president says this is the chairman before they can now zone other positions around where he comes from.

“So, they have to know whom; they have to know which zone he is from before they can now zone the remaining offices based on that. But that is not to say that individual governors or some group will not have their preferences. But those cannot mean anything, except such individuals or groups are able to convince the president to now adopt their own.”

WHO Names Nigeria among Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Production of COVID-19 Vaccine,"Deji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja

The Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries – Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia – as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.

Ghebreyesus who announced this yesterday at the European Union – African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.

The announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.

The mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.

Instead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern — COVID-19 in this case.

This triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.

Ghebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.

With the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.

President Buhari has since welcomed the development.

In his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.

He expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.

Buhari said: “We shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.”

While commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa’s developmental projections.

“In the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,” Buhari said.

Responding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: “This is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.”

The global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

Also French President, Emmanuel Macron said: “Improved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.”

On his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together “to build new solutions to protect what is most precious – our health and our lives.” He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.

The WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.

NULGE Alerts Soludo of Continuous Subletting of Anambra’s Revenue Windows to Politicians,"David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka

Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) yesterday raised the alarm over the subletting of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, had recently threatened to revoke all revenue windows allocated to politicians through an executive order on the morning of his swearing-in.

NULGE said that it has information that as Governor Obiano administration winds down, the state revenue board is allocating revenue windows to their cronies, with the intention to hijack the state’s resources.

The group’s state president, Mr. Chikwelu Adigwe who briefed members at the state secretariat of the union in Awka, said most of the revenue windows being sold out belong to the local government areas.

He also protested the hijacking of most revenues being collected by the local government councils, thereby rendering them useless.

“The condition of our service is no longer acceptable to us, so we want to make our voices heard.

“We are doing all we can during this transition period to ensure that the right things are done. We have written to the transition committee, we have also written to the Assembly to complain about the continuous confirming of transition committee chairmen, instead of holding local government elections.

“Right now, we have it on good authority that the state revenue board is still allocating revenue windows to politicians, and we want to warn the governor-elect about this.

“We are here today to complain about the way the system is running. The system was not like this when we came into the service. Things have gone so bad.

“When we were in school, we heard that there were three tiers of government, but gradually, the local government has been rendered redundant and non-existent. Our job is gradually being taken away by the state, but we will not allow this to continue.”

The union said it has resolved to take back all revenue windows belonging to it, including stall fees, wheel barrow levies, liquor license and many others, which have been taken from them by the state government.

The union also urged Soludo to ensure conduct of local government elections within three months of his swearing-in, ensure the reconstitution of the Local Government Service Commission to include local government workers, instead of an all-politicians affairs, among others.

“We have charged our members to go out and collect revenues due to their various local government councils. Any shop owner who pays revenue touts, should be ready to pay twice. We are not preaching war here, but will not run away from war,” Adigwe said.

2023: PDP BoT Chairman Cautions Party’s Presidential Aspirants against Uncomplimentary Comments,"Hammed Shittu in Ilorin

Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin, has cautioned all the presidential aspirants of the party against making uncomplimentary comments that could affect the electoral victory of the PDP in the next general elections.

He therefore urged them to continue to maintain decorum over their presidential aspirations.

Presidential aspirants in the party had engaged in a proxy war recently over the issue.

The latest was the attack by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike on the leader of the technical committee of Atiku Abubakar Presidential Campaign, Raymond Dokpesi calling him a mole working for APC.

But, Senator Jibrin yesterday in Ilorin during the turbaning ceremony of former National Chairman of the PDP, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Bareje as the Tafida of Ilorin by the Emir, Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, said the party would come out with its position on the matter very soon.

He said, “I will urge all our presidential aspirants to be calm about the issue of their presidential aspirations.

“To us, the country comes first and we will soon come out with our position on the presidential contest for all our aspirants, this is very important.

“And another important thing is that the party is yet to zone it to any party of the country.”

On the issue of the Electoral Act, the PDP BoT chairman said “President Muhammadu Buhari should assent to it at the right time.”

Meanwhile, former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki has felicitated with Baraje on his turbaning as the Tafida of Ilorin Emirate by the Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji Ibrahim Zulu Gambari.

In a statement by Saraki’s Press Officer on Local Matters, Mr. Abdulganiyu Abdulqadir, he lauded the highly respected monarch for identifying Baraje, as worthy of the position.

While stating that the traditional honour was well-deserved, he described the former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as a patriotic, bonafide and committed son of the Emirate who had contributed immensely to the uplift of the Ilorin Emirate, Kwara and Nigeria at large.

The statement read: “As you attain this enviable position today, I felicitate with you and your family as well as the Ilorin Emirate.

“Your conferment as the Tafida of Ilorin, the second personality to be honoured in the Ilorin Emirate, underscores your importance having contributed your quota as a seasoned educationist, administrator, and astute political figure.

“This is an indication of how much you are valued by the Emirate and we do hope you continue to use your personality and new office towards the advancement of Ilorin Emirate and Kwara State.”

Saraki prayed to God to grant the new Tafida of Ilorin, the life, sound health and wisdom to excel in the new task.

Also present at the colourful occasion include, the former Governor of Kwara, Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed, former Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dakwambo, former Minister of Youths and Sports, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, Senator Rafiu Adebayo Ibrahim, Senator Dino Malaye, the Director General, National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Prof. Abubakar Olanrewaju Sulaiman and former Speaker of Kwara State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Ali Ahmad.

Others include, Director General, National Institute of Legislative Studies, Prof. Suleiman Abubakar, Grand Mufti of Ilorin, Sheikh Suleiman Onikijipa, billionaire oil magnate, Hajia Muinat Shagaya, Deputy Governor of Sokoto State, Manir Muhammed and the PDP chairman, Alhaji Bello Aliyu Goronyo, among others

"EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing","The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho – a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.

SaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on “palace instructions.”



SaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.

“So everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,” a source said.

""It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don’t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.

""Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.



""They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son’s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.

""They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.""

SaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.

He was charged with stealing and conspiracy

Speaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.

“How is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.

""Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn’t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it’s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.

“The state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they’ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,” he said.

SaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin’s palace started.

He is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.



In the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, “Before reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.

“I am not on any payroll, I don’t receive any salary. My family don’t get any benefit or compensation. They haven’t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.

“I don’t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don’t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.

“It all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare’s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.

“Meanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn’t very easy; I couldn’t run because they would falsely accuse me. Though I kept on complaining to the person that brought me (Rowland), he kept telling me to keep calm that I can run when everything is over. He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.

“On May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don’t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn’t do. I was really scared.

“Then I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don’t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.

“The story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week. I waited for weeks but he never showed up but kept giving excuses when called.

“I was detained for two months, a week and a day. (May 31 to August 8, 2021); my parents never visited nor called to check up on me. It was my girlfriend that kept on bringing food to me. It wasn’t really easy though.

“Note that my parents’ property; a house on 100 by 100 and extra land were seized by the palace even before investigations started. The properties have not been returned yet.

“So after being detained again on October 25, 2021, we were charged to court. We were taken to a High Court for a stealing case. We were remanded in Oko Prison on October 26, 2021, as awaiting trial persons.

“So on a fateful day, we were called for a visit by some prison wardens that there were some visitors from the palace. On getting there, we saw Dennis Osaretin, Oyaniyen and one other palace functionary who I assume the palace sent to check to see if we were really suffering.

“Tomorrow is Christmas and I am still in prison; worst Christmas ever not for me though because I always celebrate it without going out or having fun but it’s actually the worst Christmas for my family. How are they going to celebrate Christmas knowing their son, brother is in prison? Don’t really know how they feel now but I still give thanks to GOD.”

Frank Irabor, Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, told SaharaReporters that the monarch is too big to respond to such allegations, especially as the matter is in court.

""I don't understand the case you are talking about, the case is in court, do you want Omo n'Oba (Oba of Benin) to react to that?

""If someone is detained, even for one year, that is at the discretion of the judge or the agency handling the case. They will want to continue to remand the person, maybe to conclude their investigation.

""They should not drag Omo n'Oba into it at all; he is too big for that. So there is no need to say the palace or the secretary should react. Let the court handle it. Please, he is too big for that,"" Irabor said.

Killing in the name of Biafra!,"Killing, killing, killing in the name of Biafra! When did murder become typical of the Igbo stock? When did taking innocent lives become classic in Igbo land? In Igbo cosmology, murder, ‘Igbu oshu’ is a cardinal sin deserving of banishment. A murderer is banished from the community and the land is cleansed of the abomination.

Have the Igbo settled for this governing abomination? Have the elders been functionally vasectomised? How can murder, anarchy, and fear reign in the land uncontested? Have we become a people given to bloodletting, beheading and cannibalism? Have we gone backwards in our evolution as a humane and cosmopolitan people to become savages?

Why has this cumulus of evil persisted and remained hanging over an entire region? A region that was once prosperous, peaceful and bubbling on the growth index is now a slaughterhouse that investors are running away from. The south-east is being destroyed by the same people who claim to be fighting for the people.

Security agents have been killed. Traditional rulers have been killed. Men have been killed and women have been raped and killed by this band of parademons. A few days ago, ‘’unknown gunmen’’ attacked a police station and killed three policemen in Ebonyi. Last week, gunmen killed seven community leaders in Imo. And the killings persist.

It has now become customary for residents of the south-east to wake up to severed heads dangling from poles in market squares, roads and community facilities. An unsleeping evil has taken over the land.

On Wednesday, these ‘’unknown gunmen’’ invaded a cattle market at Omumauzor; a community in Ukwa West LGA of Abia. The market is said to be peopled by Nigerians from the north. They came not to buy cattle, but to kill. By the time they were done, eight citizens were dead. These parademons did not spare anything, they killed cattle and set the market ablaze. What sort of bestiality is this?

According to Abia state government, the gunmen struck around 11pm on Tuesday. “On Tuesday, 15th February 2022 at about 11:35pm, some yet-to-be-identified hoodlums allegedly invaded traders at the New Cattle Market located in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of our dear state. We are shocked and saddened by this mindless and barbaric act of violence that claimed the lives of about 8 innocent citizens of our great country and we totally condemn this dastardly act together with its wicked perpetrators,’’ the state government said.

The attack appears to be ethnically-motivated and targeted. This makes it very dangerous. These ravagers are not only threatening the lives of Igbo citizens and other Nigerians in the south-east, they are also jeopardising the safety and security of Igbo citizens in other parts of the country.

As I said in the column, ‘Ndi Igbo stand for One Nigeria’, those crusading for the secession of the south-east today are deficient students of history and sociology. Even the late Odumegwu Ojukwu, the captain of the secessionist struggle during the war, regretted that devastating episode in our history. Ojukwu said: ‘’I don’t think the second war is necessary. We should have learnt from the first one.”

There is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.

The Igbo elite and citizens must take a stand to end this fast descent into utter devastation. Instead of angling for the presidency in 2023, we should work at ending the carnage in our home. Onye ulo ya na-agba oku, anaghi achu oke. Our house is on fire we cannot afford to be chasing a will-o-the-wisp.

‘To make COVID-19 the last’ -- Bill Gates to release book on preventing future pandemics,"Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), says he has written a book on how to prevent future pandemics.

In a recent newsletter, Gates said he spent the last two years working with his partners and colleagues at the Gates Foundation to stop COVID-19.

He added that the book titled ‘How to Prevent the Next Pandemic’ is about what he learned researching COVID-19 to make sure no one suffers through the misery of the last two years again.

“The last two years have caused unbelievable amounts of hardship around the world… whenever I see the suffering that COVID has created — every time I read about the latest death toll or hear about someone who lost their job or drive by a school that is closed — I can’t help but think: We don’t have to do this again,” he said.

“COVID has only made it clearer that the world needs to prioritize eliminating pandemics as a threat to humanity. I’ve been following COVID since the early days of the outbreak, working with experts from inside and out of the Gates Foundation who are championing a more equitable response and have been fighting infectious diseases for decades.

“I’ve learned a lot in the process — both about this pandemic and how we stop the next one — and I want to share what I’ve heard with people. So, I started writing a book about how we can make sure that no one suffers through a pandemic ever again.”

He said that the book, which launches on May 3, 2022, contains a step by step plan, innovations and tools on how to equitably stop pathogens early.

He also said that he outlined processes that can be used to provide better healthcare for everyone globally.

Tension in Osun as APC holds governorship primary today,"By Olusesan Laoye

The political atmosphere in Osun State, is intense Saturday morning, as the ruling party in the state, the All Progressive Congress (APC), holds its governorship primary election amid escalating rift between the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola.

Across Osogbo, the state capital, there is presence of the security personnel at every corner, signaling that they are ready to deal with any one who forments trouble, but their mere presence has made residents apprehensive.

Security men, including the Police, the Army, Civil Defence, DSS, among others, are seen patrolling the streets Osogbo and other major cities in the state.

On Friday, as a result of the presence of the armed security operatives people hurried to their homes, meaning that shops and markets closed very early.

Some of those interviewed by the Business Hallmark said they were scared and could not tell what could happen at the venues of the primary, since voting would be done at ward level, before the results are collateral at the state’s party secretariat in Osogbo.

Some noted that the heavy security personnel was uncalled for since it is just a primary to decide who gets the ticket of the party, even as they wondered what would then happen on the election day proper.

The state has been boiling for the past few days over the crisis between the former governor, now Minister of Interior, Aregbesola and Mr. Oyetola, both of whom have been campaigning aggressively.

Aregbesola is supporting the former Secretary to the government during his tenure, Moshood Adeoti against Oyetola who wants the ticket of the party for a second term.

The former governor has since vowed to use all machineries at his disposal to prevent Oyetola’s second term, but he is unlikely to stop the governor who appears to be very much in control of the state.

The feud between the duo also heightened the frosty relationship which has been existing between Tinubu and Aregbesola.","By Olusesan LaoyeThe political atmosphere in Osun State, is intense Saturday morning, as the ruling party in the state, the All Progressive Congress (APC), holds its governorship primary election amid escalating rift between the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola.

Osun PDP faction rejects appointment of Sunday Bisi as acting chairman,"By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo

A faction of the Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, has frowned at a letter “purportedly communicating” a decision of the National Working Committee of the party to appoint Mr Sunday Bisi as the acting chairman of the party.

Recall that a couple of days ago, the intra-party leadership squabble bedeviling the major opposition party in the state, was said to have been finally laid to rest with a landmark judgement delivered by Justice Aderibigbe of the State High Court sitting in Ile-Ife.

The court ruled that Hon Soji Adagunodo was the Chairman of the party before his resignation from office, while stressing further in its verdict that the congress conducted under the leadership of Hon Adagunodo and all other legitimate actions done by him while in office were valid.

Members of the group therefore argue that from the judgement it was clear that, part of the actions done in office by the Hon Adagunodo was handing over to Barr wale Ojo, who is the vice Chairman from the region/zone of the former Chairman before his resignation from office.

The members, including the acting chairman of the faction, Wale Ojo, maintained that they were the authentic Exco of the PDP in the state.

Speaking at the rally, Mr. Ojo said ” As you can see, our people from across the 30 local governments and the Area office have converged here today to show they’re displeased with the position of the NWC.

“Let me say to you in clear terms, this is about constitionality and in the face of the law I remain the valid and legally recognized State Acting Chairman of Osun PDP. If you ask me, I would tell you unequivocally and expressly that the letter sent out as the position of the NWC of our great party is a mistake and this mistake will be pointed out and corrected.”

Our correspondent also spoke to one of the leaders of the group who is a commissioner during the tenure of Prince Olagunsoye oyinlola, Sooko Sunday Adewole.

He said, “We have gathered this afternoon to send strong signal to the Sen Iyorchia Ayu’s led NWC of our great party to watch their back. He should desist from walking on the same path as the erstwhile occupant of that office, Prince Uche Secondus did.”

A former Chairman of the Party in Osun, Barr. Ojo Williams, said “the Peoples’ Democratic Party which you all know is a democratic and law abiding party. What are we as a party going to campaign with, if we cannot obey a simple court pronouncement?

“The constitution of our party is supreme. What this implies is that the dictates of the party constitution is supreme and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

9PSB CEO Seeks Targeted Content to Accelerate Nigeria’s Financial Inclusion,"The Chief Executive Officer, 9PSB, Branka Mracajac, has emphasized the need to pay close attention to content creation as an important factor in driving and accelerating financial inclusion in the country, stating that it is capable of enhancing the future of digital banking in the long-term.

Mracajac made this assertion, while presenting a keynote address, themed “Content Creation and Financial Inclusion; The Future of Digital Banking” at the Tech Summit Ogun 2022, which held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Abeokuta, Ogun State on Thursday February 17, 2022.

According to her, while there are ongoing efforts to support the country’s financial inclusion drive, a lot more rest on formulating tailored strategies that address specific needs. “Providing access to the banking agents and touch points, across the country is happening as we speak; payment service banks,

microfinance banks, and FinTech companies are all working on this. But will this be enough? Will the access to digital banks change the mindset of Nigerians in rural areas of the country and be enough to drive the transition from cash to cashless society?” she questioned.

Proffering the way forward, Mracajac stressed the need to provide financial literacy through content that speaks to an average Nigerian in unserved rural areas of the country, stating that financial inclusion is a process, not just a point in time and space that we want to reach.

She added that, developing content that speaks only to the already banked and mirroring the digital financial habits of those who are fully included and heavily banked, will not help to keep the newly on-boarded in the system long-term.

She stated: “While creating and delivering the content for financial inclusion, we need to have in mind the needs of its beneficiaries, the targeted end-users of the financial services who are currently underserved and the only sustainable way is that we join our forces and create the content – apps and services that will address the specific needs of a farmer in Benue, market women in Onitsha, trader in Kano, fisherman in Delta, and the woman selling ofada rice in Ogun State.”

Speaking further, she noted that, to drive the offline individuals and MSMEs from cash to cashless, from analog to digital and from informal to formal, content creators need to focus on two major goals; one, to deliver relevant and on-point digital financial literacy content, educating people about the principles, ways, modules, and benefits of banking. The second one, she stated, is needed for sustainable Financial inclusion: delivery of digital banking services that are a reflection of the lifestyle of the currently unbanked and underserved population.

She called on all stakeholders within the financial ecosystem, including content creators to work collectively to develop and implement a digital content strategy for the unbanked to move the financial inclusion needle and ultimately advance the economy, society and improve life of every Nigerian.

In his own keynote address, titled “Disruptive Innovation: Production and Distribution of Creative Content, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), Dr. Abimbola Alale remarked that the quality of creatives and start-ups that Nigeria has produced is a testament to the potential of the ecosystem, and as such the ministry will continue to support the tech and creative entrepreneurs to play their part in developing Nigeria’s digital economy.

The Tech Summit Ogun is an annual convergence of Tech disruptors, innovators, startups, organizations and technology enthusiast in Ogun State, aimed at spurring technological innovation towards the digital transformation and technological advancement of Ogun State. This year, the summit attracted over 2000 participants, mainly the youths and start-ups.

Niger Govt Lauds CSJ On Fiscal Transparency Training,"The Niger State government has praised the work of the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) in training public officials in the state on the principles and practice of fiscal transparency.

The state’s commissioner for finance, Alhaji Zakari Abubakar, who spoke at the four-day ‘train the trainers’ capacity building on increasing citizen’s participation in the budget process in Minna, told the participants that the presence of a team of professionals from CSJ in their midst was a rare opportunity that must not be allowed to elude them.

The training was organised under the State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) Programme for Results- a reform programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and performance. A component of the SFTAS programme is the Disbursement Linked Indicator 2 (DLI 2) focused on “Increasing Openness and Citizens Engagement in the Budget Process”.

The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) is the firm hired by the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning under the SFTAS to develop, design and provide support for states in the development of a process guide for the state budget office that details the flow of budget development process and documents required for fiscal transparency.

The Niger State finance commissioner who is also overseeing the Niger State Planning Commission said, “A lot of concerted efforts have been made by SFTAS in the last three years towards developing templates and tools alongside knowledge needed to sustain and strengthen the achievement of the programme.”

He said Niger State was one of the few entities in Nigeria that keyed into SFTAS right from inception.

The training which drew participants from the Niger State Ministry of Finance, Niger State Planning Commission, Niger State Auditor-General Office, Accountant General’s Office and members of the civil society organisations was focused on helping participants integrate ideas on citizens’ participation in the budgeting processes and increase transparency across all stages of the budget.

"NIFAA, Pathfinder Sensitise Faith Leaders On COVID-19 Vaccines","The Nigerian Inter-Faith Action Association (NIFAA) in collaboration with Pathfinder International held a one-day inter-faith dialogue Thursday in Abuja to sensitise Nigerians, through faith leaders, on the COVID-19 vaccines.

NIFAA programme manager, Dr. Fatima Mairami, in her welcome address at the session tagged; “Access Project Inter-Faith Town Hall Dialogue”, said some believe that COVID was gone, but that it was very much around, changed lives, and was still doing a lot of harm to its victims.

She said: “The COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to help fight the virus, but unfortunately, the uptake is low in Nigeria due to several misconceptions; and NIFAA is holding this meeting to get faith leaders more informed to clarify their doubts and dispel the rumours scaring people away.

“Part of the objective of this event is to achieve high acceptance of the recommended COVID-19 vaccinations and have more people take it by sensitising faith leaders on the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, and they are expected to take the message back to their congregants,” she added.

The meeting urged leaders of faith communities to ensure they pass the right information about COVID-19 vaccines to their members as an act of love, since they will be protecting themselves and others around them.

“Faith leaders should take ownership of the process, empower and equip themselves with the necessary information, live by example, motivate people around them, be an advocate by utilizing every opportunity given to sensitize members on COVID-19 vaccine; be innovative and creative such as using focus group discussion, drama, brief presentation, on COVID-19,” she said.

killing in the name of Biafra,"By Fredrick Nwabufo

Killing, killing, killing in the name of Biafra! When did murder become typical of the Igbo stock? When did taking innocent lives become classic in Igbo land? In Igbo cosmology, murder, ‘Igbu oshu’ is a cardinal sin deserving of banishment. A murderer is banished from the community and the land is cleansed of the abomination.

Have the Igbo settled for this governing abomination? Have the elders been functionally vasectomised? How can murder, anarchy, and fear reign in the land uncontested? Have we become a people given to bloodletting, beheading and cannibalism? Have we gone backwards in our evolution as a humane and cosmopolitan people to become savages?

Why has this cumulus of evil persisted and remained hanging over an entire region? A region that was once prosperous, peaceful and bubbling on the growth index is now a slaughterhouse that investors are running away from. The south-east is being destroyed by the same people who claim to be fighting for the people.

Security agents have been killed. Traditional rulers have been killed. Men have been killed and women have been raped and killed by this band of parademons. A few days ago, ‘’unknown gunmen’’ attacked a police station and killed three policemen in Ebonyi. Last week, gunmen killed seven community leaders in Imo. And the killings persist.

There is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.

It has now become customary for residents of the south-east to wake up to severed heads dangling from poles in market squares, roads and community facilities. An unsleeping evil has taken over the land.

On Wednesday, these ‘’unknown gunmen’’ invaded a cattle market at Omumauzor; a community in Ukwa West LGA of Abia. The market is said to be peopled by Nigerians from the north. They came not to buy cattle, but to kill. By the time they were done, eight citizens were dead. These parademons did not spare anything, they killed cattle and set the market ablaze. What sort of bestiality is this?

According to Abia state government, the gunmen struck around 11pm on Tuesday. “On Tuesday, 15th February 2022 at about 11:35pm, some yet-to-be-identified hoodlums allegedly invaded traders at the New Cattle Market located in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of our dear state. We are shocked and saddened by this mindless and barbaric act of violence that claimed the lives of about 8 innocent citizens of our great country and we totally condemn this dastardly act together with its wicked perpetrators,’’ the state government said.

The attack appears to be ethnically-motivated and targeted. This makes it very dangerous. These ravagers are not only threatening the lives of Igbo citizens and other Nigerians in the south-east, they are also jeopardising the safety and security of Igbo citizens in other parts of the country.

As I said in the column, ‘Ndi Igbo stand for One Nigeria’, those crusading for the secession of the south-east today are deficient students of history and sociology. Even the late Odumegwu Ojukwu, the captain of the secessionist struggle during the war, regretted that devastating episode in our history. Ojukwu said: ‘’I don’t think the second war is necessary. We should have learnt from the first one.”

There is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.

The Igbo elite and citizens must take a stand to end this fast descent into utter devastation. Instead of angling for the presidency in 2023, we should work at ending the carnage in our home. Onye ulo ya na-agba oku, anaghi achu oke. Our house is on fire we cannot afford to be chasing a will-o-the-wisp.

The 33-year-old, who is also a sprinter, was expelled from the Tokyo Olympics last year before the women’s 100m semi-finals after testing positive for human growth hormone at an out-of-competition test in Slovakia on July 19.

The AIU in a statement issued on Friday explained why Okagbare was punished with a 10-year ban.

The AIU statement read in part: “The sole arbitrator adjudicating the case concluded that the athlete’s use of multiple prohibited substances as part of an organised doping regimen in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympic Games was egregious conduct that amounted to aggravating circumstances under the Rules thereby warranting an additional period of ineligibility on top of the standard four-year sanction.”

Osinbajo Calls For Imposition Of Severe Costs For Delays In Justice Delivery,"Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for the imposition of severe costs for delays in justice administration and delivery.

The vice-president explained that the court is a taxpayer-funded public resource and the wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the justice system.

According to a statement signed on Saturday by Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, the Vice President said this on Friday night at the 20th year memorial anniversary symposium in honour of a legal luminary, Bankole Olumide Aluko, SAN.

The Vice President, who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy, and digitisation in the judiciary, among others, noted that “the administration of justice system is the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.”

He added that “Severe costs should attend adjournments. There is no greater waste of taxpayer’s funds than for a scheduled case to have to be adjourned. It is only heavy costs that will discourage this malfeasance.”

According to him, addressing delays should “involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.”

“Adverse costs are paid to the successful party in a civil case and wasted costs are directed against legal practitioners for poor professional standards in the conduct of a case.”

Osinbajo said “certainty or predictability of judicial outcomes is one of the major strengths of the common law.”

Regarding the impact of the law on democracy, Osinbajo said that “the democratic rights of the people and their confidence in the notion of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, suffers when the system of electoral justice fails to see itself as a handmaid of the democratic process.”

Citing the decision of the Supreme Court in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State to buttress his point, the VP noted that “to make sense, judicial decisions and reasoning must in most cases meet the common notions of fairness and justice.

“The system of justice must recognize the larger principles that it serves. In judicial interpretation, the spirit is as important as the letter of the law. Otherwise, judicial decisions become technistic applications far removed from common sense.

“The notions of justice that would meet public expectations of fairness and equity are those that promote substance over form. The observance of technicality over merit will always alienate the system of justice from the people it is meant to serve.”

On the expectations from judicial officers, Prof. Osinbajo said “while we ask for the best from our judicial officers, we must equally ensure that the conditions under which they operate are not only befitting but are good enough to attract the best of minds in our profession.”

In addition, the Vice President said the institution and infrastructure remain key to reforming the system, stating that “the judge is, of course, central to how our system of justice works. It is the court, not counsel that must determine the pace of cases.”

On the process for judicial appointments, the VP stated that the robustness and transparency of the processes in other jurisdictions “provide comfort to the candidates of the fairness of the selection process; and enable the public to have front-row seat in some of these processes”, arguing that such a process be replicated in Nigeria.

He, however, assured that the challenges affecting the administration of justice in Nigeria are being addressed, and “there is much hope for the positive reform of the system as more result-oriented work is going on and some real changes expected.”","Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for the imposition of severe costs for delays in justice administration and delivery.
The vice-president explained that the court is a taxpayer-funded public resource and the wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the justice system.
The Vice President, who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy, and digitisation in the judiciary, among others, noted that “the administration of justice system is the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.”He added that “Severe costs should attend adjournments.

Biden Now ‘Convinced’ Russia Will Launch Invasion of Ukraine,"U.S. President Joe Biden says he is now “convinced” Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital, an ominous assessment that emerged as the country’s war-torn east saw more attacks that the West said could be designed to establish a pretext for an attack.

After weeks of saying the U.S. was not sure if Putin had made the final decision, Biden said Friday that his judgment had changed, citing American intelligence.

“As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.”

The president’s comments at the White House followed a day of rising violence that included a humanitarian convoy hit by shelling and a car bombing in the eastern city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian rebels began evacuating civilians from the conflict zone with an announcement that appeared to be part of Moscow’s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats.

Biden reiterated his threat of crushing economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to reconsider. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a steep price for any invasion.

As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a major military push, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.

The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.

Lines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.

Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops now posted around Ukraine’s borders, the long-simmering separatist conflict could provide the spark for a broader attack.

Fears of such escalation intensified amid Friday’s violence. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported.

There were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities.

Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage.

Overall, monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported more than 600 explosions in the war-torn east of Ukraine on Friday.

Separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas announced they were evacuating civilians to Russia.

Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.

Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign could include staged, prerecorded videos.

Authorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own.

Putin ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas region.

By early Saturday, more than 1,100 residents of the rebel-controlled areas arrived in the neighboring Russian region of Rostov, according to the region’s authorities, and thousands more were expected. Separatist officials have said they plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people.

The explosions and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia could use to justify an invasion.

Around the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation.

Ukraine denied planning any offensive.

“We are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is “more complex and probably higher” than during the Cold War. He told a security conference in Munich that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences.

Russia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback and instead observed more troops moving toward the border with Ukraine.

In other developments, the White House and the U.K. formally blamed Russia for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the intrusions, which barraged websites with junk data to make them unreachable.

The Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches.

Asked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that did not materialize, Putin said: “There are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it’s worth.”

“We are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,” he said. “We have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.”

Canada: Police Arrest 100 in Ottawa after 3-week Protest,"Police arrested scores of demonstrators and towed away vehicles Friday in Canada’s besieged capital, and a stream of trucks started leaving under the pressure, raising authorities’ hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country’s COVID-19 restrictions.

By evening, at least 100 people had been arrested, mostly on mischief charges, and nearly two dozen vehicles had been towed, including all of those blocking one of the city’s major streets, authorities said. One officer had a minor injury, but no protesters were hurt, interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell said.

Police “continue to push forward to take control of our streets,” he said, adding: “We will work day and night until this is completed.”

Those arrested included four protest leaders. One received bail while the others remained jailed.

The crackdown on the self-styled Freedom Convoy began in the morning, when hundreds of police, some in riot gear and some carrying automatic weapons, descended into the protest zone and began leading demonstrators away in handcuffs through the snowy streets as holdout truckers blared their horns.

Tow truck operators — wearing neon-green ski masks, with their companies’ decals taped over on their trucks to conceal their identities — arrived under police escort and started removing the hundreds of big rigs, campers and other vehicles parked shoulder-to-shoulder near Parliament. Police smashed through the door of at least one RV camper before hauling it away.

Scuffles broke out in places, and police repeatedly went nose-to-nose with the protesters and pushed the crowd back amid cries of “Freedom!” and the singing of the national anthem, “O Canada.” Later police on horses were used to push back the crowd for a time.

Police said late in the afternoon that protesters had assaulted officers and tried to take their weapons. Some began dismantling equipment at a stage where they had played music for weeks, saying they didn’t want it to get destroyed.

Many protesters stood their ground in the face of one of the biggest police enforcement actions in Canada’s history, with officers drawn from around the country.

“Freedom was never free,” said trucker Kevin Homaund, of Montreal. “So what if they put the handcuffs on us and they put us in jail?”

But a steady procession of trucks began leaving Parliament Hill in the afternoon.

“There are indications we are now starting to see progress,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.

Police would not disclose how many protesters or vehicles remained downtown. All indications were that police would be working into the weekend to clear the area.

The capital and its paralyzed streets represented the movement’s last stronghold after weeks of demonstrations and blockades that shut down border crossings into the U.S. and created one of the most serious tests yet for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They also shook Canada’s reputation for civility, with some blaming America’s influence.

Authorities had hesitated to move against the protests, in part because of fears of violence. The demonstrations have drawn right-wing extremists and veterans, some of them armed.

With police and the government facing accusations that they let the protests get out of hand, Trudeau on Monday invoked Canada’s Emergencies Act. That gave law enforcement extraordinary authority to declare the blockades illegal, tow away trucks, arrest the drivers, suspend their licenses and freeze their bank accounts.

Ottawa police made their first move to end the occupation late Thursday with the arrest of two key protest leaders. They also sealed off much of the downtown area to outsiders to prevent them from coming to the aid of the protesters.

The emergency act enabled law enforcement authorities to compel tow truck companies to assist. Ottawa police said earlier that they couldn’t find tow truck drivers willing to help because they either sympathized with the movement or feared retaliation.

As police worked to dismantle the siege, Pat King, one of the protest leaders, told truckers, “Please stay peaceful,” while also threatening the livelihoods of the tow truck operators.

“You are committing career suicide,” King warned on Facebook. “We know where the trucks came from.”

King himself was later arrested by officers who surrounded him in his car.

Ottawa police had made it clear for days that they were preparing to retake the streets. On Friday, even as the operation was underway, police issued another round of warnings via social media and loudspeaker, offering protesters one more chance to leave and avoid arrest.

Some locked arms instead as officers formed a line to push them back.

Dan Holland, a protester from London Ontario, packed up his car as police closed in. “I don’t want to get beat up by this police,” he said.

Children bundled up in coats and hats stood amid the crowd. Police said the protesters had put the youngsters in the middle in the confrontation.

The Freedom Convoy demonstrations initially focused on Canada’s vaccine requirement for truckers entering the country but soon morphed into a broad attack on COVID-19 precautions and Trudeau’s government.

Ottawa residents complained of being harassed and intimidated by the truckers and obtained a court injunction to stop their incessant honking.

Trudeau portrayed the protesters as members of a “fringe” element. Canadians have largely embraced the country’s COVID-19 restrictions, with the vast majority vaccinated, including an estimated 90% of the nation’s truckers. Some of the vaccine and mask mandates imposed by the provinces are already falling away rapidly.

The biggest border blockade, at the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, disrupted the flow of auto parts between the two countries and forced the industry to curtail production. Authorities lifted the siege last weekend after arresting dozens of protesters.

The final border blockade, in Manitoba, across from North Dakota, ended peacefully on Wednesday.

WHO Names Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Covid Vaccine Production,"The Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries – Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia – as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.

Ghebreyesus who announced this on Friday at the European Union – African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.

The announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.



The mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.

Instead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern — COVID-19 in this case.

This triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.

Ghebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.



With the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.

President Buhari has since welcomed the development.



In his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.



He expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.

Buhari said: “We shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.”

While commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa’s developmental projections.

“In the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,” Buhari said.



Responding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: “This is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.”

The global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.



Also French President, Emmanuel Macron said: “Improved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.”

On his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together “to build new solutions to protect what is most precious – our health and our lives.” He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.



The WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.

Nigeria: APC Set to Postpone National Convention by Two Weeks,"The National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 may not be held on that day after all.

THISDAY can authoritatively confirm that the convention will be postponed by two weeks.

Efforts to speak to the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, who is also the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, on this latest development proved abortive.

Though there is no formal announcement yet, a very reliable party source informed THISDAY last night that the (CECPC) and the APC governors would meet President Muhammadu Buhari today to propose a new date, which is likely to be March 12.

The source who preferred anonymity said, “The convention has been postponed by two weeks but it is not official yet. The Caretaker Committee and the governors will meet with the President on Saturday (today) to propose the new date.”

Also, a former member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who pleaded for anonymity, said it was already clear that the convention would not hold, “because there are some things that needed to be done for the convention to hold as scheduled on February 26 and most of them had not been done, with few days to February 26.”

The source stressed that, for instance, one of the things that ought to have been done was zoning of party offices.

He continued: “People have not bought forms and people cannot buy form if the zoning is not done; and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don’t know the zoning, you can’t buy a form.

“There are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. I remember that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees beside the main convention committee.”

Reacting to the purported plans by some governors and a principal officer in the Senate to foist Senator Abdulahi Adamu on the party, he said “while individuals or groups can have preference, President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who becomes the next Chairman of the party.

“Whatever you are hearing now are mere speculations because nobody can push anybody. All of them are waiting for the president. Everybody is waiting for the president and that is why until the president says this is the chairman before they can now zone other positions around where he comes from.

“So, they have to know whom; they have to know which zone he is from before they can now zone the remaining offices based on that. But that is not to say that individual governors or some group will not have their preferences. But those cannot mean anything, except such individuals or groups are able to convince the president to now adopt their own.”

"Amaechi’s courage, energy make him best candidate for APC presidential ticket – Princewill","THE courage and energy of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi make him the preferred candidate to clinch the Presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress ahead of the 2023 election, a former governorship candidate in Rivers State, Tonye Princewill has stated.

Speaking during an interactive meeting with select journalists in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Princewill said it would take a politician of Amaechi’s pedigree to to tackle the myriads of problems confronting the nation.

He further said the former Rivers State Governor is the only credible person that has what it takes to move the country to the next level.

Princewill noted that if performance and the knowledge of Nigeria’s politics were criteria to determine who should be the country’s President in 2023, “then the cap fits Rotimi Amaechi.”

He said that the wealth of experience Amaechi has gathered over the years as two-time speaker, chairman of the Speakers Forum; two-term governor; chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum; ‘’Director-General who sacked a sitting President and the best performing minister makes him the best man for the job.”

Princewill noted that though Amaechi may be stubborn, “he is very stubborn for results. He does not take ‘no’ for an answer. He goes for results and he has always gotten results in anything he sets his eyes on.

He added, “Amaechi took over the moribund railway industry and transformed it to something that we all can be proud of as a people. He may not remember friendship when he becomes President because he needs results that would make Nigerians happy.

Haruna said the group, which comprised youths and women, decided that it was time for a youthful and energetic president to emerge in 2023 in order to tackle the numerous problems confronting the nation.

He further said since Bello was elected governor, he has delivered the dividends of democracy to Kogi residents, especially in the area of human capital development ‘’which was why a lot of Nigerians are urging him to contest for the 2023 presidency.’’

He said, “We are calling on Governor Bello to run for the office of President because at this stage of Nigeria’s existence, we need a youthful leader who is vibrant and has the strength and capacity to take us out of the present situation that we find ourselves in.

“We have mobilized thousands of youths across the North-Central zone and we are making efforts to get more people to join us because we believe that Yahaya Bello is the solution to the problems of Nigeria”.

"Bolt ripping us off, drivers lament","SOME operators of Bolt, an e-hailing service provider, have accused the company of ripping them off.

They accused the company of increasing its commission without notifying the operators.

Some drivers who spoke in separate interviews with our correspondent on Friday said the company has increased its charges from 20 to 25 per cent.

A driver who simply gave his name as Charles said the company should have considered the drivers while implementing their new price regime.

He added that it would have been of benefit to drivers and the company if the fares on trips were jerked up a little, adding that as it is, the drivers would bear the brunt.

Charles said, “We just noticed our trips were not correlating with the amount we usually earn. Then it was 20 per cent on each trip they charged as commission on Bolt. All of a sudden, it was increased to 25 per cent. There was no communication or any notice from them. Several complaints have been made to Bolt but they are yet to give us reasons for their actions.

“That five per cent is a lot. For instance, if they are taking N2, 000 for the whole day, it won’t be a problem, but you are deducting 25 per cent on each trip. We maintain our cars; spare parts are expensive, we fuel our cars, we do most of the work.

“What they are offering is just the platform. They increased the commission and the fare remains the same. We are not against the increase in commission; let it not be a loss on our part. I went to fix my fuel pump on Monday, the price has risen from N8,000 to N20,000.

“On the app at times, you see N20,000 and you would be surprised you may not have more than N8,000 from the N20, 000. This is after deducting their commission, they could remove like N5,000 as commission, now you are left with N15, 000.”

A female Bolt driver, who gave her name simply as Jenny said a lot of benefits that allowed them to earn more had been taken away by the e-hailing company.

She said, “What have drivers done to bolt? They came with a lot of incentives. All of them are no more. Initially they started with 15 per cent incentive; they were giving drivers promo as well as the customers.”

Agreements with Twitter not censorship – FG,"



The Federal Government says the agreements it reached with Twitter to resume operations in the country were not meant to censor the microblogging site and other social media platforms in general.

The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who stated this on Saturday, added that the agreement, to be extended to other social media platforms operating in the country, would ensure that only wholesome content were published by the platforms.

The Minister was speaking on “Radio Link’’, a phone-in programme of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria monitored by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).

He reiterated the resolve of the government to regulate the social media in a manner that would not stifle the freedom of speech and expression, as well as strangulate the media.

“We are going to regulate the social media not because we want to stifle the media or we want to violate the right of expression.

“We want to ensure that only wholesome contents were available on the social media.

“Recently we were all shocked when an 18-year old boy, accused of killing his 21-year old girlfriend for money rituals, confessed that he leant the diabolical act on social media.

“The teenager, in collaboration with his friends, cut off the head of the victim and were burning it in a pot when they were apprehended.

“The government has the responsibility to ensure that social media platforms were responsible and the contents they displayed were not harmful to young people, as well as the unity of the country,’’ he said.

On the other agreements reached with Twitter, which the minister said would be applicable to other online platforms, the micro blogging site had agreed to open its Nigeria office within the first quarter of the 2022.

He said Twitter agreed to appoint a designated country representative within one month of lifting its suspension, while its global policy team will also be available to engage directly with the government

The minister said Twitter agreed to meet all regulatory demands, including the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Nigeria Communication Commission laws and rules and the National Broadcasting Commission Code.

“Twitter also agreed to comply with all payable taxes, as they were operating under Nigerian laws and this they agreed to do within one week of restoring their operations.

“Twitter agreed to immediately work with the federal government in the area of code of conduct, that were in line with global best practices

Twitter agreed to immediately enrol Nigerians in its Law Enforcement portals and Partners Support Portal”.

“The law enforcement portal will provide dedicated channels for the Nigerian law enforcement agencies to escalate reports on contents that violate the code of conduct or national laws.

“Similarly, the partner support portal provides a direct channel for government to engage Twitter staff to manage prohibited contents,” he said.

He reiterated that relevant laws and the broadcasting code would be amended to ensure that the agreement reached with Twitter would be applicable to other social media platforms.

"2023: Buhari, Jonathan tip Anyim for higher responsibilities",".

By Dirisu Yakubu

Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the duo of President Muhammadu Buhari and ex-President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, commended the leadership qualities of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, saying he has all it takes to be entrusted with higher responsibilities in the future.

In their separate remarks at an event in Abuja to honour Anyim on the occasion of his 61st birthday, they described Anyim as a humble leader who sees the entire country as single constituency.

President Buhari, represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, noted that at various times while serving in different capacities, Anyim rose to the challenge of leadership by putting the nation first.

He said: “Senator Pius Anyim is a patriotic Nigerian who always puts his nation first and he is one of stabilizing voices we have today in the politics of our country. This he has demonstrated in a number of times, but the one that stands out and still echoes with me was his insistence that elected officers should always stay a single term and he kept to his word by not seeking for re-election to the Senate, after the expiration of his first term as Senator and Senate President in 2003.

“That many Nigerians cutting across various political divides are gathered here today to celebrate you is a glowing testimony of your contributions to the growth of our nation and its political development,” Buhari stated.

In what would count as an endorsement of Anyim’s 2023 Presidential aspiration, Mustapha added that the experiences garnered over the years by the former Senate President place him at a vantage position to seek a higher political calling.

He continued: “Let me say on a personal note, as the current and 19th SGF that I have drawn a lot from the wealth of wisdom that has been the source of strength and the endowment that Senator Anyim has brought to the fore of governance in this country. We don’t often meet but whenever we meet, we share knowledge about the responsibilities of the office and the enormity of the act of balancing contending forces and interests, that is always vested on any occupant of that office.

“And I want to thank you (Anyim), for the wealth of experience and the depth of knowledge that we have. I made bold to say whoever had occupied the Office of the Secretary to the government for four years In an evolving democracy like Nigeria, with diverse contentious issues, is capable and able to occupy any office,” he added.

Like Buhari, Jonathan described Anyim as a unique leader who never allowed the trappings of office to get into his head.

For Jonathan, the sheer number of people gathered at the International Conference Centre to honour Anyim was an indication of the trust Nigerians reposed in his years after leaving the office as Secretary to the Government of the Federation.

“Some people are very busy and on most Saturdays, some people don’t like to wake up early. For you to have gathered these numbers as early as this time today means a lot.

“We thank God for you today, your wife, your children, all your friends, with all of us here your friends, otherwise, we wouldn’t have been here to celebrate you today. You are a Government somebody that I know a little.

“You were the Senate President when I was the governor of Bayelsa state and I remembered you visited me in the house one day and of course by divine providence, you became the engine of my government as my Secretary to the government of the Federation.

“The first day I became President, Anyim Pius Anyim wanted to be chairman of PDP and he came to me with a lot of dreams and we spoke. I may not bother you with details but he was never the chairman of PDP.

“When he became the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, he did not even come to me with a biscuit but we found him worthy as a Nigerian that had experience in managing systems, managing issues and also somebody who had friends across the country and when we were looking at the person we wanted to be the Secretary to the Government, of course, we wanted somebody from the South-East because PDP then normally made sure that every geo-political zone had one key office. Now, we don’t have enough people, so we don’t have that.

“Up to the time I was the President, something somehow happened in a way that we never expected. The PDP philosophy then was that the President will come from one geo-political zone, the Vice President from one geo-political zone, Secretary to Government from the one-geo political zone, the Chairman of the party from one geo-political, the Senate President from one geo-political zone and the Speaker from one geo-political zone but that was when PDP had a lot of spread across the country.

“Now it is difficult to package that because even the All Progressives Congress, APC doesn’t have that kind of spread. So, it is difficult to get that package. That was very unique and it was a good way of accommodating every section of the country.

“And so we zoned the Secretary to the Government to the South-East. We looked at our brothers and sisters, the characters, and they were very nice people. They had many competent people but let me say that it’s like a lot it fell on Anyim Pius Anyim and we made him the Secretary to the Government. And I don’t regret committing him. He is a very hard working young man, committed to serving this nation and I believe if he has the opportunity to serve more, he can do better,” Jonathan said.

At 61, Anyim is a bridge between the old and the young and that fact was not lost on Jonathan when he said: “Today, we are celebrating a young man but you are getting old now. At 61 years, you are no longer very young but you are willing to serve and as somebody who has served at the parliament as a Senate President, at the executive level as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, it is quite tasking.

“Having served in that position (SGF) for the period, I know he is fully baked and I didn’t receive too many complaints. You know as a President, every day you receive complaints from those who work for you- the ministers, your aides, advisers, assistants and so on. I didn’t receive too many complaints about Anyim Pius Anyim,” he added.

Former Vice President, Namadi Sambo who came with Jonathan also took to the podium to pour encomiums on the celebrant, saying, “his leadership stabilized the Senate and we must be grateful for that. He was a team player who worked towards a prosperous nation. He can be trusted with higher political responsibility in the future.”

Former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Bello Adoke in his goodwill message described Anyim as ‘a team player, a humble leader that is always ready to take on any task for the good of his country.”

Also speaking, former governor of Abia state, Sen. Theodore Orji said at 61, Anyim has a lot still to give to his fatherland. “If you look at the age he started, you will know that God has not finished with him,” he stated.

"UK returns Benin bronze cockerel, Oba head worth £2.5 million","The Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, yesterday received during a colourful ceremony at his palace in the Edo State capital, two stolen artifacts: Cockerel (Okpa) and Uhunwun Elao (Oba head) from Europe, worth £2.5 million.

The artifacts were handed over to the first-class monarch by the Nigerian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Mr. Tunji Ishola, on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, 125 years after they were looted from the Benin palace.

Ishola disclosed that the two artifacts were preserved in their original forms, while the value of the Cockerel today was put at £2 million, with the Oba head valued at £500,000.

The high commissioner stated that he was directed by President Buhari to hand over the artifacts to the Oba of Benin.

Ishola hailed the British government for preserving the artifacts in their original forms, while disclosing that efforts were still on to make sure that many of the stolen artifacts were returned to Benin’s palace.

The two artifacts, out of the no fewer than ten thousand, which were taken from the palace of Oba of Benin during the British expedition of 1897, were returned by Jesus College of Cambridge University and University of Aberdeen, Scotland.

Besides Ishola, the event was also attended by the Director General, National Commission of Museums and Monuments (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani; eminent Benin sons and daughters; prominent traditional rulers; security chiefs and other distinguished personalities.

Tijani, in his remarks, stated that it was historical that the artifacts were returned in his tenure, while many attempts in the past were frustrated by the holding countries.

He said: “I have on many occasions met the holders (of the artifacts) and told them that the Benin artifacts were not artworks, but life arts and part of the history of Benin people, not works for commercial value or aesthetics.

“We are making history, because none of us was here when the artifacts were taken away in 1897, but we are here to receive them. I have already scheduled to visit other countries in Europe, to convince the holders to return them.”

While receiving the artifacts, Oba of Benin, whose speech was presented by his younger brother, Prince Aghatise Erediauwa, stated that the artifacts transcend mere art, but mostly of religious significance, while the two bronzes would return to where they rightly belonged.

He said: “We are witnessing today the beginning of the restitution of our artifacts, which were looted in 1897. Contrary to reports that the military expedition of 1897 was a retaliation for the killing of some British soldiers, the truth is that there was a calculated and a deliberately conceived plan to attack Benin for its territorial dominance and also for her treasures.

“The result was a destruction of a civilisation, which equalled or even surpassed that of the aggressors. It was thought that the kingdom (Benin), totally decimated and in ruins in the aftermath of the war, would not rise again. By the grace of God and our ancestors, we are still standing.”

The Benin monarch also hailed President Buhari for taking keen interest in the repatriation of the artifacts, while pleading with persons who were genuinely interested in the cause to join him, in the interest of peace, tranquility and the substance of Benin cultural heritage.","The Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, yesterday received during a colourful ceremony at his palace in the Edo State capital, two stolen artifacts: Cockerel (Okpa) and Uhunwun Elao (Oba head) from Europe, worth £2.5 million.

"PDP defies Police in Calabar, flags-off by-election campaign","The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State has defied the Police in Calabar, the state capital as it flagged-off campaign for the by-elections to fill the vacant seats in the Ogoja/Yala Federal constituency and the Akpabuyo State Constituency. This was just as Rivers State governor, Nyesome Wike, pledged his full support for the party in order to help it win the by-elections fixed for February 26. Wike was a Special guest of honour at the party’s rally on Saturday.

Impressed by the huge crowd that attended the rally in the state capital and the fact that they defied an attempt by the Police to stop the rally, Wike declared that he was convinced that the PDP was still firmly rooted in the state. “Be rest assured that I will give the PDP in the state my full support to ensure you win in the by-election and in 2023 elections. Don’t allow APC intimidate you.”

He said it was unfortunate and shameful for anyone to try to intimidate members of PDP by using security operatives to stop a rally for ordinary federal and state constituency by-elections. Wike added that any government that had done well would not use such a gimmick in its bid to stop a rally unless they were not confident or had not done well for the people. He alleged that the ruling APC was afraid of signing the electoral bill into law because they were afraid of transmission of results and the level of transparency the act would guarantee.

His words : “Why on earth will they try stop an ordinary rally if they have done well, this is just by- elections for federal and state constituency ,what if it was the governorship ,what would they have done ? If they had succeeded in stopping us from holding the rally, that would have been the end of the party in Cross River ,but we are very resilient people.

“2023 is not 2019 ,PDP means business ,we are taking over Cross River State , go out and get your PVCs ,make sure you vote and also make sure you guide and protect your vote, it is obvious that you are ready to take over Cross River once again. Do not be afraid ,they tried it in Rivers State , but we resisted them , it is just a form of intimidation , I thought the only way to test the people is to allow them to hold their rally whether they would come or not ,but with the crowd here ,it shows that things are not well with them ( APC).

“With the by- elections, they will know and understand that it is no longer business as usual ,indeed we will leave no stone unturned , we must defeat APC, forget about presidential ambition we must win this first ,” he said. Speaking earlier the Chairman of PDP in Cross River, Venatius Ikem Esq, expressed satisfaction over the patience by party stalwarts adding that they tried to stop them but it did not work.

Nigeria needs more rebels to move forward – Obasanjo,"Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that Nigeria requires honest people as rebels to move her forward.

Obasanjo said people who live life of honesty and integrity have to also be rebels, explaining that life of honesty and integrity embolden one to speak truth to power, not caring a hoot whose ox is gored.

The elder statesman spoke yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, at the unveiling of the autobiography of the Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, as part of the celebration of his(Sowunmi) 80th birthday.

The autobiography titled “Footprints Of A Rebel,” was reviewed by Hafsat Abiola – Costello, daughter of the late politician, MKO Abiola, and founder of Kudirat Initiative for Democracy.

According to Obasanjo, having honest people as rebels remained one of the greatest assets for rebuilding a nation.

He lauded the octogenarian and former activist for living an exemplary life worthy of emulation by the younger generation.

“Looking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel? But it is good.

“But the truth is that if you have to leave a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel. There would be some time you would be asked to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that, you will become a rebel. You may even become a persona non grata.

“There is no country that we can call our own except Nigeria. Our country, Nigeria, needs more rebels. Those who would look at things straight in the face and say ‘this is not good for Nigeria,” Obasanjo said.

"CAN endorses Sanwo-Olu for second term, says performance outstanding","For the giant strides recorded in Lagos State in the last three years, the Body of Christ in the state has publicly thrown its weight behind Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, endorsing the governor for a second term.

At the 2022 Inter-Denominational Divine Service organised by the Lagos Chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Christian body was unequivocal in its endorsement of the governor for a second term, as it described the Sanwo-Olu administration as one that is “consciously pragmatic and proactive.”

CAN added that the governor, in his administrative style, has sustained and built on the culture of excellent governance bequeathed to the public sector in the state by his predecessors, especially the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

For this reason, the Body of Christ in Lagos wants Sanwo-Olu to return for a second term.

Christian leaders from all denominations in the membership of CAN in Lagos were present at the event held at The Apostolic Church (LAWNA) Territorial Headquarters in Ketu with the theme: “Choose You This Day Whom You Will Serve.”

CAN chairman, Rt. Reverend Stephen Adegbite, who described Sanwo-Olu as “a child of God,” said the governor’s programmes and projects had been felt across all sectors, adding that the governor had been delivering on his administration’s development blueprint with fear of God.

He said: “Sanwo-Olu is a child of God and when you have a child of God at the helm of affairs, all you get is excellent results. The blind can see the developments going on in Lagos and the determination of the governor to consolidate on the THEMES Agenda. The governor has been wonderful and we are seeing progress across all sectors.

“Given the governor’s outstanding performance, the Body of Christ in Lagos State is saying unequivocally that one good turn deserves another. Since we do not change a winning team, let us all pray and support this performing, pragmatic, wonderful, ever-consciously proactive, people-oriented and God-fearing Government to continue for a second term.”

Adegbite hailed the governor and his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, for upholding synergy and harmony in administering the affairs of the state. He also praised the First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, and wife of the Deputy Governor for supporting their husbands with various projects.

The Lagos CAN chairman also gave a tacit endorsement of the presidential ambition of Tinubu, saying the country would be in for a new and better country if Tinubu was allowed to have a shot at the presidency and replicate Lagos progress at the national level.

“We all know there is a bigger project being pursued in Lagos State at the national level and if we see a replication of what is happening in Lagos at the national level, definitely Nigeria would be a better place for all to dwell in,” Adegbite said.

In acceptance, Sanwo-Olu, who was in attendance at the event, expressed the faith that the CAN endorsement came on the heels of the group’s dispassionate assessment of his administration’s achievements.

The Governor said his purpose in Government was to offer his physical strength and intellect to uplift conditions of the people, stressing that no service would be greater and pleasing to God than serving mankind.

Sanwo-Olu said: “Our covenant with God is to serve the people and give our best ability in the period we have been chosen to serve. Indeed, we appreciate the support and prayers of the Christian body.”","For the giant strides recorded in Lagos State in the last three years, the Body of Christ in the state has publicly thrown its weight behind Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, endorsing the governor for a second term.

Osinbajo Seeks Award Of Severe Costs For Justice Delay,"Challenges affecting the administration of justice in Nigeria are being addressed with much hope for positive reform as more result-oriented work is in progress with expected changes, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said.

He said addressing delays in the administration of justice should involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.

Prof. Osinbajo spoke at the 20th memorial anniversary symposium in honour of a legal practitioner, Mr. Bankole Olumide Aluko, (SAN) themed, “Administration of Justice: the Ideal Standard, the Nigeria Reality and Our Potential” on Friday.

A statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, said the vice president who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy and digitisation in the judiciary among others, noted that the administration of justice system was the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.

“The court is a taxpayer-funded public resource. The wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the system.

“Adverse costs are paid to the successful party in a civil case and wasted costs are directed against legal practitioners for poor professional standards in the conduct of a case.

“Severe costs should attend adjournments, there is no greater waste of taxpayer’s funds than for a scheduled case to have to be adjourned. It is only heavy costs that will discourage this malfeasance.”

He noted that certainty or predictability of judicial outcomes is one of the major strengths of the common law.

Regarding the impact of the law on democracy, Osinbajo noted that the democratic rights of the people and their confidence in the notion of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, suffers when the system of electoral justice fails to see itself as a handmaid of the democratic process.

Citing the decision of the Supreme Court in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State to buttress his point, he noted that to make sense, judicial decisions and reasoning must in most cases meet the common notions of fairness and justice.

“The system of justice must recognise the larger principles that it serves. In judicial interpretation, the spirit is as important as the letter of the law. Otherwise, judicial decisions become technistic applications far removed from common sense.

“The notions of justice that would meet public expectations of fairness and equity are those that promote substance over form. The observance of technicality over merit will always alienate the system of justice from the people it is meant to serve,” he said.

On the expectations from judicial officers, Prof. Osinbajo said “while we ask for the best from our judicial officers, we must equally ensure that the conditions under which they operate are not only befitting but are good enough to attract the best of minds in our profession.”","He said addressing delays in the administration of justice should involve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.

2023 presidency: Bayelsa traditional rulers root for Osinbajo,"By Chijioke Okoronkwo

The Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council on Saturday said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has the potential to be a good president.

King Malla Sasime, Vice Chairman, Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council, expressed this view while receiving Osinbajo who paid a courtesy call on traditional rulers at the Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council Secretariat on Saturday in Yenagoa.

Osinbajo was in Bayelsa to perform the groundbreaking of the construction of Angiama-Oporoma Bridge, which will link Yenagoa, Capital of Bayelsa, and the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area.

The traditional ruler thanked Osinbajo for the visit and implored him to maintain the cordial relationship with the state.

“Vice President, your name has been called for very good reasons; and the reason why your name has been on is maybe people think that you have been very good and we appreciate your efforts in governance.

“If you come out for president, you will be a good material as those rumours are all over the place in the social media.

“So, we thank you for being a good vice president; we hope that you keep your relationship with Bayelsa in very good stead; thank you very much,’’ he said.

Responding, Osinbajo, who was accompanied by Gov. Douye Diri, thanked Sasime for his kind welcome and reception.

He said that he was in the state to identify with developmental projects of the governor in collaboration with the Federal Government.

“As you have heard, I am here at the invitation of my brother, the Governor of Bayelsa, to celebrate the second year anniversary of his government and also to look at some of the works that are going as well as perform the groundbreaking of a very important project.

“We will be driving in a few minutes on the Yenagoa-Oporoma-Ukubie road; and thereafter, we will be performing the groundbreaking of the Angiama-Oporoma Bridge–which are very crucial projects.

“I am sure you all know how important that road project is; and how several governments have worked on it including the immediate past governor of the state.

“They have done their own bit up to a point and in the true tradition of continuum of the government, the current governor is set to complete the project and to ensure that he made available to the good people of Bayelsa, especially many of these communities that will benefit significantly from this.’’

According to the vice president, the project is an evidence of the collaboration between the federal and state governments.

He said that President Muhammadu Buhari had shown by his openness, by his desire to ensure that despite political differences, every state in Nigeria benefits fairly and justly.

“By making sure that as this road has been built, the Federal Government refunded the cost of the project so far and will continue to refund.

“So, essentially, what we are seeing here is collaboration between the state and the Federal Governments for the benefit of the good people of Bayelsa.

“I think that this is the way it must be; at the end of the day, political differences do not matter to our people; what our people want is the same thing everywhere across the country.

“They want good roads; they want good infrastructure; they want an enabling environment to be able to do their businesses; they want good health facilities; good social facilities; and that’s what really the Federal Government is determined to do.’’

Osinbajo said he was happy that the Federal Government had a partner in the government of Bayelsa, led by Diri.

He said sure desires could only be achieved if everyone works together, the federal, state, local governments working together.

“The politicians and technocrats are working together to ensure that we achieve the same objective.”

He thanked the governor for the warm welcome and for the nice Ijaw outfit that he (Osinbajo) wore.

“When you look at this outfit, you would imagine that this is what I wear everyday; it is well made but it is courtesy of my dear brother, Diri.

“He is the one that made sure that I am appropriately attired.

“All, I can say to him is that he has to make me a few more because after people have seen this, they expect me to show up more often in this outfit.

“So, I want to thank you very much your Royal Majesties and thank the good people of Bayelsa for the warm welcome,’’ he said.

Osinbajo was earlier presented with a traditional gift — a walking stick — to match the Ijaw traditional attire he adorned. (NAN)","By Chijioke OkoronkwoThe Bayelsa Traditional Rulers Council on Saturday said Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has the potential to be a good president.

"We’re living in squalor, we need help, Okobaba inmates cry out","Lara Adejoro

The Okobaba Destitute Home, located in Ebute Metta, Lagos, was established in the early ’90s by a former military administrator of Lagos State, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd.) The home popularly known as ‘beggars colony’ was established to provide shelter and succour to the needy, majority of whom are living with health and physical deformities. Among the inmates are lepers, the blind and the crippled. The Okobaba Destitute Home has, however, become not just a filthy overcrowded squalor but also a haven for infections. LARA ADEJORO reports:

Debris, pet bottles, metals, papers, takeaway plates litter the compound with offensive stenches oozing out—all in piles, mountains-high at times. Those are the features that jump at any first-timer at the Okobaba Destitute Home, in Nigeria’s megacity, Lagos.

The home established alongside three other rehabilitation settlements in the early ’90s by the Lagos State Government is now in deplorable condition with many of the inmates equally in a poor state.

Also, almost permanently etched on the faces of the inmates is worry. No first-time visitors to the home will miss this. Looking at the inmates, you can almost feel how palpably affected and worried they are by their conditions.

Another thing that stares the first-time visitor in the face is the level of overcrowding. The congestion of humans in the small abode will instantly heighten the prospect of the rapid spread of respiratory infections, cholera, diarrhoea—for the visitors and the residents.

Filth lurks around from the compound and the shanties that dot the camp. The gutters are clogged with dark, thick, dirty water, leftover foods, and floating human feaces.

The residents have become accustomed to breathing in the smelly putrid and deadly air as most of them grew up in the environment. They now see the offensive odour as a normal part of life as they seat under canopies in the scorching sun, though most of them are not oblivious of their plight in Africa’s economic hub.

However, for daily survival, their expectation is that Non-Governmental Organisations and humanitarian bodies will visit to support them, give them food, and clothes.

Located in the heart of Lagos in Ebute Metta, a neighbourhood of Lagos Mainland, Okobaba Destitute Home houses over 2,000 vulnerable people, including the blind, the crippled, the lepers.

There appears no reason to call it home. Flies from open defecation and over-flowing latrines buzz about, perching on their food. Or, rather, the food brought to them—because they can’t afford cooking. And if they cook, they do it in the open.

As the state population grows, so does the number of destitute in the small corners they cram into. And as the population grows, so too does the demand for more rooms, comfort, good living conditions, and sanitation.

The residents at the destitute home are among the most vulnerable in Nigeria and the most neglected—in one swoop. Even among the destitute homes, Okobaba Destitute Home is a glaring victim of inequality. Their counterparts at Majidun fare much better. Yet they both caught the government’s attention once in the past. The Okobaba Destitute Home is surely not feeling the impact of government.

Yet, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had pledged to double up interventions to take care of orphans, children with special needs, the elders, the mentally challenged, and other vulnerable groups in the state.

It could be recalled that the governor, while speaking during the inauguration of the Social Welfare Integrated Programme Initiative in Ikeja recently, had said, “As a Government, we are not going to give excuses, there’s a lot that we can do for the children and vulnerable people out there. And I will personally take the lead and see that we double up our interventions through Ministries of Youth and Social Development, Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, and other MDAs.”

However, his promises seem far-fetched as the conditions of the inmates spell otherwise.

Truncated comfort

With a population of over 2000, five or more people are crammed in each of the 174 rooms in the home.

Most occupants in the rooms tie up their mattresses and mats once they are awake to allow for passage, while clothes are heaped on the floor in the rooms.

Outside the rooms are benches laid with cartons for some to lay their heads because of the lack of ventilation in the rooms.

“I stay here,” a middle-aged man who sells sponges for a living said in Hausa language, pointing at the bench he sleeps on.

“As you can see, there is no ventilation in the rooms and it is always jam-packed, there is no air circulation.

“Some of the rooms here are for the married and some are for singles and you can have from four to six people in a room.

“I’m not the only one who sleeps outside, you need to come here in the night to see what the situation looks like,” the Zamfara state indigene said.

Some jostle for space beside the block of buildings to build shanties with woods and zincs. However, most of those shanties are prone to flood and often collapse during heavy rainfall.

Our correspondent also learnt that the inmates usually open their shelter to others who can’t afford rent in the megacity. This could be contributing to the high level of overcrowding.

To worsen the hygiene situation in the home, just a pit latrine and one bathroom are attached to eleven rooms.

The toilets and bathrooms are in poor shape. Virtually all of them have dirty, soggy floors and broken doors. They are no doubt serious hotbeds of diseases, with an overwhelming stench of feaces, maggots, and flies buzzing around irritatingly. But as irritating as they look, residents of the home were seen going in to answer the call of nature.

According to experts, the poor sanitary conditions of the home pose serious health challenges to residents.

Speaking with PUNCH HealthWise about the situation in the home, a Professor of Public Health and former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria, Tanimola Akande, lamented that the overcrowding of the home is a serious health risk.

“It makes people susceptible to respiratory infections that are easily transmitted from one person to the other like Tuberculosis and skin diseases.

“An unhygienic environment like dirty toilets and bathrooms easily provide room for transmission of infectious diseases caused by viruses and bacteria as well as fungal infections.

“Diarrhoea diseases and some sexually transmitted infections (not as common as often mentioned by people) can result from dirty, unkempt toilets,” Akande said.

Also, a report by the World Health Organisation, stated that poor sanitation is linked to the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio and exacerbates stunting.

“Poor sanitation reduces human well-being, social and economic development due to impacts such as anxiety, risk of sexual assault, and lost educational opportunities.

“Inadequate sanitation is estimated to cause 432,000 diarrhoeal deaths annually and is a major factor in several neglected tropical diseases, including intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, and trachoma. Poor sanitation also contributes to malnutrition,” the global health body noted.

Bleak hope

While the majority of the inmates may have adjusted to the harsh reality of their existence, some of them are, however, protesting against the unacceptable condition and lamenting their plight even though they feel helpless about their situation.

It is, however, not in doubt that the majority of them are grappling with dreariness, with the regretful way they speak, especially about the lack of comfort, food, and help.

One of such is Hajia Hawau, who seems to have lost touch with reality. She neither knows her age nor how long she has stayed in the home.

Speaking in the Hausa language, she said she would appreciate any help the government can offer to make life more comfortable for her.

“I need help. I need money. I just want to be fine, anything that the government can do to help me, I will be happy,” she said.

Aisha Nasiru, a mother of five children, is another resident of the home.

The 38-year-old Kano indigene says she would accept any gift that may come her way.

“I’m crippled and I’m from Kano state. I need money to start something, feed my children and take care of myself,” she said.

Alleged tribalism

The General Secretary of the home identified as Mohammed Baba alleged that tribalism discourages the young ones from going to school.

Baba, who is a graduate of the University of Maiduguri said, “Most of the children born here go to primary school but one thing that discourages them from furthering their education is tribalism.

“We’ve been asked by the government that we should train our children in school but tribalism from your people always discourage the children.

“Lagos state offers a free primary school for the pupils. If there is nothing like tribalism, our children would have benefited from it and gone to the university.

“There are some people and even NGOs who are coming to support our children, even to the university; but they cant take care of all the children and we can’t put all the responsibilities on the NGOs. The government should do something,” he said.

Dearth of drugs

However, a visit to the Majidun Rehabilitation and Training Centre located on Isawo Road, Agric, Ikorodu, by PUNCH HealthWise revealed a different narrative compared to the poor state of the Okobaba home.

The environment at the Majidun centre is well-kept, and the place looked organised. Also, the inmates look orderly. Two officials man the gate of the home.

Our correspondent sighted some inmates who were seated at the health facility waiting to receive medical care.

Our correspondent learnt that there are doctors and nurses at the centre who attend to the inmates’ medical needs.

PUNCH HealthWise, however, learnt that some drugs needed by inmates are out of stock at the pharmacy department of the centre.

A list of out-of-stock drugs obtained by our correspondent showed that there are over 20 drugs needed at the centre that are presently not available. They include: Trifluoperazine, Risperidone 2mg, Olanzapine 10mg, Sodium valproate 200mg.

Nevertheless, inmates of the Oko Baba destitute will bless their stars if they enjoyed half of what the Majidun destitute have.

But the Director of Programmes for Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, Mr. Philip Jakpor, says the government should be held responsible for the poor state of rehabilitation homes in the state.

He insisted that it is the responsibility of the Lagos government to make the environment livable for the inmates.

“It is the responsibility of the government which has set up those places to rehabilitate citizens undergoing specific challenges. It is the responsibility of the government to make the conditions of those places livable so that the individuals supposedly rehabilitated do not suffer double jeopardy.

“If the conditions are not made conducive or responsive to the challenges of those they are housed there, these centers may end up churning out broken people who will not only be worse than they got there but also become a menace to the society,” Jakpor said.

PUNCH HealthWise contacted the Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, for comments regarding the state of living of the destitute, but he did not respond to calls or the text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.

"NAFDAC impounds 120 tons of imported ‘ponmo’, arrests seven merchants","Deborah Tolu-Kolawole

The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control said it intercepted in Lagos State, large quantities of dangerous animal hides and skins popularly known as “Ponmo” with seven merchants of the deadly product in the agency’s net.

The Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, however, warned the general public, particularly consumers of Ponmo against the activities of some unscrupulous businessmen and traders who are selling industrial animal hides as food articles.

Adeyeye, in a statement by the Resident Media Consultant to NAFDAC, Sayo Akintola, in Lagos on Sunday, disclosed that NAFDAC Investigation and Enforcement officials carried out intelligence gathering around certain locations where the alleged products were being warehoused and sold.

The statement partly read, “This was in response to several complaints received from the public, pertaining to alleged sale and distribution of imported hides and skins meant for use in leather industries and which had already been processed with industrial chemicals.

These hides and skins are then sold to the unsuspecting public as consumable animal skin products, otherwise called ‘Ponmo’.

“Monitoring was also extended to some buyers who patronise the sellers and custodians of the warehouse,” she said, adding that preliminary investigation revealed that some of the hides and skins were “imported illegally and sometimes diverted to some merchants of death who re-process the hides and skins and further sell them as consumable Ponmo to the public”.

In the light of these discoveries, she said that the agency recently conducted investigative raids upon some identified locations in Lagos State where market women and men were found clustered for the purchase of leftovers from the warehouses.

She disclosed that large quantities (120 tons) of the products were intercepted at six different locations, stressing that seven suspects who were alleged to be involved in the acts are currently under investigation.

The NAFDAC boss further explained that samples of the products have been sent to the laboratory for testing to ascertain the quality and unwholesomeness of the products.

According to her, the intervention would help the Agency deal with the interaction and the dangers associated with the consumption of these products.

“The street value of the product currently intercepted is estimated to be around N25.330m only,” she said.

Adeyeye, however, alerted the general public to the existence of “these merchants of death and their nefarious activities as she warned Nigerians to exercise caution when buying animal hides, popularly known as Ponmo”.

“NAFDAC wishes to advise consumers and retailers of Ponmo not to patronise importers of hides and skins for consumable animal skins,” she added.

NDLEA intercepts $4.7million counterfeit cash in Abuja,"**Arrests nursing mum 3 weeks after bail on same drug offence

By Kingsley Omonobi

The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, an Sunday disclosed that its operatives have foiled the attempt by a syndicate to steal at least N2.7 billion from the Nigerian economy by pushing into circulation fake $4.7 million cash.

The operatives had in the early hours of Friday 18th February 2022 intercepted a consignment sent from Lagos to Abuja at Abaji area of the Federal Capital Territory.

A controlled delivery of the parcelled counterfeit US dollars totaling $4, 760, 000.00 led to the arrest of a principal suspect, 52-year-old Abdulmumini Maikasuwa.

The seizure followed intelligence received by the FCT Command of the Agency detailing the movement of the cash and the vehicle conveying it.

Meanwhile, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has directed that both the cash and the suspect in custody be transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for further investigation.

In Kwara state, barely three weeks after a nursing mother, Mrs. Rashidat Adebayo, 38, was granted administrative bail following her arrest for dealing in illicit drugs, operatives have again arrested her in Offa with assorted drugs such as Tramadol, Swinol, Diazepam and Pentazocine injection ampules.

Before her latest arrest on Thursday 17th February, the nursing mother had been arrested and granted bail on 24th January 2022 for dealing in similar drugs.

In the same vein, NDLEA officers have arrested two drug dealers: Sani Isa (aka Bilaz) and Bala Yerima in Hong, Adamawa state with 239 blocks of cannabis sativa weighing 209kg, just as operatives of the Bauchi state Command have intercepted a truck marked FFF 422 XB coming from Lagos to Maiduguri, at Azare, Bauchi.

A statement by Femi Babafemi, Director of Media and Advocacy said “A total of 164.8kg of cannabis sativa concealed in peak milk cartons was recovered from the truck”.

The NDLEA Chief Executive has commended the officers and men of the FCT Command for their vigilance and preventing counterfeit $4.7 million from going into the streets.

He charged them and their counterparts in Adamawa, Kwara, Bauchi and others across the country not to rest on their oars.

Investing in people ‘ll hasten Nigeria’s devt — Bawa Garba,".

By Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo

Founder of the first Satellite TV in Northern Nigeria, Alhaji Bawa Garba, ABG, has said Nigeria’s future will be bright if the country invests in its population by way of developing human capital.

He spoke Kaduna at a ceremony organized to mark his 80th birthday anniversary.

ABG who initiated the first-ever Kaduna International Trade Fair explained that developing human capacity towards achieving a set goal and objectives in productive service to mankind and country had been his business philosophy.

He said that a productive population would ensure a bright and secure future for the upcoming generations.

ABG unveiled a plan to establish a fertilizer blending plant in Kaduna which he assured would provide jobs for thousands of Nigerians.

A retired Commissioner of Police, Garba Galadima, during the occasion, paid glowing tributes to ABG, describing him as a principled man of commendable virtues.

He said ABG was always on the lookout for allies, attending to their needs and above all proffering solutions to problems where they existed.

Galadima who was in his eighties also was in charge of the police force in Kaduna between 1986 and 1989, a period he recalled with nostalgia were most memorable in his career courtesy of the CEO of ABG Communication.

He revealed that the home of the celebrant was amongst the earliest points of call where he held a public outing, a wedding ceremony he stated was tumultuous and warm.

He said that despite being away from his state of origin and new in Kaduna, the philanthropist made him feel very much at home.

One of the children of Alhaji Bawa Garba, Hon. Shehu Bawa (ABG) who represented Kaduna North in the House of Reps between 2011 and 2015, was full of eulogies for a father who he said sacrificed all to ensure he and his siblings acquire the best of education for service to the country and humanity.

He described the patriarch of the family as a disciplinarian, a stickler to moral upright and a caring father to all his children, whom he said would rather forgo personal interests for sake of the ABG clan.

Children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the octogenarian took turns to eulogize the celebrant, wishing him more happy years in service to Allah and mankind.","By Ibrahim Hassan-WuyoFounder of the first Satellite TV in Northern Nigeria, Alhaji Bawa Garba, ABG, has said Nigeria’s future will be bright if the country invests in its population by way of developing human capital.

2023: ‘How Jonathan can be Nigeria’s president again’,"Dr. Goodluck Jonathan

By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja

Ahead of next year’s general election, an Abuja-based pro-democracy and good governance advocacy group has asked former President Goodluck Jonathan to close ranks with President Muhammadu Buhari and join the ruling All Progressives Congress APC with a view to getting the party’s presidential ticket.

The Citizens Network for Peace and Development gave the charge Sunday in Abuja at a media parley on the state of the nation.

National Coordinator of the network, Okorie ‘Ohamadike’ Raphael who spoke on behalf of the group noted that Nigeria deserves a leader who is respected even beyond her borders and who is convinced that his ambition is not worth the blood of any Nigerian.

According to him, Jonathan’s bloodless ambition puts him in a vantage position over and above those who see politics as a do or die affair.

He said; “The 2023 elections in our opinion, is not about the politicians. It is about the citizenry, the Nigerian people! It is about us and our desire for continuity and sustainability of the democratic gains.

“This briefing is not for lamentations, nor is it centred on disparaging the image of any Nigerian. However, in the past few days, a few personages have indicated interest in running for the Office of the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023.

“Over the years, it has been an all-comers affair. The process of election or is it ‘selection’ of our leaders past has glaringly never really been based on the will of the people; rather it has been mostly predicated on the design of the elites whose motive is targeted at manipulating the system personal benefit or that of their minions. Such though is the game of politics but I dare say that we have all had enough of that.

“Having carefully scanned the political firmament in search of a credible, knowledgeable, selfless, trusted and patriotic candidate to occupy the exalted position of President of Nigeria. It is not in doubt that Nigeria is at a crossroads between discontent, fear and suspicion and the propensity for peace, reconciliation and hope. Our searchlight has fallen on none other than former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan GCFR. His antecedents speak volumes. His compassion and passion for peace and Nigeria’s development cannot be overlooked.

“Those who vigorously criticized his administration and misunderstood his conciliatory and transformative approach to governance have soon realized that his patriotism and love for Nigeria is unflinching. For President Goodluck Jonathan he has shown that the interest of the Nigeria comes first. This was demonstrated by his actions during and in the aftermath of the 2015 Elections, specifically the historic phone call he made to President Mohammadu Buhari. He has indeed proven to be a peace maker and patriotic. He epitomises a true defender of democracy. His exemplary display of political solidarity and commitment to the progress of Nigeria has earned him crucial international roles as special envoy, mediator and resource person in global governance and security. He has also represented the African Union, ECOWAS and other global organizations in political matters especially election monitoring, reconciliation and peacemaking across the continent. This can be attributed to his sterling leadership qualities and character.

“Looking closer home, Goodluck Jonathan’s track record as an achiever, nationalist and visionary leader are clearly evident around us. A good number of megaprojects initiated by his administration litter the horizon and though quite a number stand today in credit to the present administration in the spirit of continuity, the fact remains that he has left indelible footprints in the sands of time.

“Presently, the distrust in the polity requires a tested Nigerian like Jonathan to bridge the gap and foreclose any suspicion as is the case with some of those that have indicated interest in occupying Aso Rock come 2023. We do not need a leader who is coming onboard with hangers-on who at best will constitute themselves into a nuisance and unwanted distraction. We do not need a leader whose history is chequered with more questions than answers and we certainly do not need a leader whose ambition is just to be President and nothing more”, he added.

Nigeria’s judiciary open to initiatives – CJN tells US delegation,"The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon (Dr) Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad has clarified that the country’s judiciary is open to initiatives aimed at improving and strengthening the capacity of judicial officers in the handling of cases on emerging crime trend in the country.

Justice Muhammad made the clarification at the weekend, in Abuja, while playing host to a visiting delegation of the United States officials led by the Ambassador to Nigeria, Ms. Mary Beth Leonard.

The CJN’s remark at the occasion was made public on Sunday by Mr Ahuraka Yusuf Isah, Senior Special Assistant on Media to the CJN.

Some of those emerging crimes, the CJN said include cybercrime, cross-jurisdictional infringement of Intellectual property rights, and cases related to cybersecurity and espionage.

The CJN added that judges in the country require training on block technology and online dispute resolution as it affects e-commerce which is becoming a challenge due to inadequate awareness of technology and technical abilities and capacity.

The CJN requested for workshops that would border on Copyright Law in the new digital environment for judicial officers and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards relating to intellectual property disputes.

‘’Capacity building for our judicial officers is our priority, while the development of the capacity of our Research Assistants and other staff of the National Judicial Institute, who are fully involved in these training programmes, is also very important.

“Your Excellency, without taking the cat out of your bag, I want to assure you that our doors are always wide open to welcome proposals that will be beneficial to the development of the Rule of Law and the overall growth of the Judiciary of this country.

“The National Judicial Institute will never relent in its efforts to serve as the principal focal point of judicial activities on issues relating to the promotion of efficiency, uniformity and improvement in the quality of judicial services in our courts’’, the CJN stated.

The U.S. Ambassador said, ‘’this courtesy call is an opportunity to encourage the Nigerian Judiciary to continue collaborating with the United States Mission, including in raising the profile of intellectual property (IP) protection which is essential for Nigeria’s development and international partnerships’’.

The U.S., she said, was looking to increase its capacity-building engagement on cybersecurity issues, adding that her country is interested in continued collaboration with the Judiciary and courts through its International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office (INL) and Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT).

Ms. Leonard hinted that the U.S. was exploring how best to support Nigeria’s judicial processes during the 2023 elections.

The Justices of the Supreme Court, who accompanied the CJN to receive the U.S. delegation are Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, Inyang John Okoro, Amina Adamu Augie, Ejembi Eko, Uwani Musa Abba-Aji, M.L.Garba, H.M. Ogunwumiju, Abdu Aboki, Adamu Jauro and Emmanuel A. Agim.

Nicholas John: South Africa police make promise after death of Nigerian,"The South African police have vowed to ensure the safety of Nigerians residing in the country, after the latest round of mob attacks that left a Nigerian, Nicholas John, dead.

The police made the promise when the leadership of the Nigeria Union South Africa (NUSA), led by Mr Collins Mgbo, its President, met stakeholders at Kimberley district in Northern Cape, South Africa, where a Nigerian died, after a mob attack.

Mgbo said in a statement from Pretoria on Sunday that the meeting was attended by Head of Kimberley Police Cluster, Brig. Rikhostso, the host community, representatives of religious organisations and the South African widow of late Mr John.

John’s widow was identified as Ms. Caroline Chikoma, who is currently nursing a 4-month-old baby.

Mgbo revealed that the aim of the meeting was to appeal to the police to ensure that justice was served in the tragic assault on John and for his killers to be brought to book.

Mgbo said, “Secondly, the meeting was able to establish a structure or team, comprising the police, Nigerians, churches and other migrant community organisations.

“The responsibility of this group is to make sure that information is sent across to the police whenever there is a crisis so that the police can handle the matter quickly before it gets out of control.

“The police have promised the Nigerian community that they’ll make sure their lives and properties are protected.”

FBI vs Hushpuppi: FG told to extradite Abba Kyari to US after NDLEA arrest,"Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has urged the Federal Government of Nigeria to allow the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari, to be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) over the hushpuppi scandal.

Recall that the FBI is prosecuting Ramon Abbas, a.k.a. Hushpuppi, for charges bordering on Business Email Compromise (BEC) and money laundering.

In August 2021, the FBI asked Nigeria to hand Kyari over to them.

Last Monday, Kyari and others were arrested by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for alleged links with an international narcotics cartel.

On Thursday, the Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the officers indicted for links with the international drug cartel.

“DCP Abba Kyari, who prior to this allegation was on suspension, shall remain so,” the PSC wrote.

Earlier, the anti-narcotics agency revealed the statements Kyari made to undercover operatives investigating the cocaine seizure.

Reacting to the development, Ohanaeze, in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, advised the FG not to let Kyari remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by the NDLEA.

The statement read, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has warned that the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari should never be allowed to remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by NDLEA, with overwhelming evidence of complicity in drugs-related cases.

“Rather than keeping him here in Nigeria, he should be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from FBI over the hushpuppi scandal and criminal activities.

“DCP Abba Kyari should be allowed to face his crimes in the United States. This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.

“The activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.

“The overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect’s belongings and cash is second to none; that’s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.”

“There is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari. Nemesis is hunting Kyari. Nigerians want a thorough investigation of the alleged criminal indictment of Abba Kyari and subsequent extradition to the United States.”","In August 2021, the FBI asked Nigeria to hand Kyari over to them.

The government also announced that markets, parks and offices would be closed while movement of persons and vehicles would be restricted from 8am to 4pm except for those on essential duties.

A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information, Steve Oruruo explained: “The Enugu State Government (ENSG) wishes to notify the public that Local Government elections will hold on Wednesday, February 23, 2022, across the state.

“Consequently, the Government has declared a statewide work free day on Wednesday, February 23, from 8 A.M. to 4 P.M. to allow the people exercise their constitutional suffrage.

“During this period, markets and offices shall be closed and movement of persons and vehicles restricted, except for those on essential duties.

“All residents legally qualified to vote are therefore encouraged to go to the polls and cast their ballots.

“The state government, in its unflinching commitment to safeguarding and strengthening our democracy, has made requisite arrangements to guarantee a hitch-free process”.

However, the main opposition party in Enugu the All Progressives Congress (APC) has vowed to get legal backing to void the exercise if the Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) conducts it without listing its candidates in the ballot. Read Also: ‘Anambra poll success boosted INEC’s confidence’ The party, which had raised the alarm over alleged exclusion of its candidates from participating in the poll, alleged that it had been stopped from participating because the list of her candidates were not published by the electoral body.

The party accused ENSIEC of deliberate plot to disenfranchise the party faithful by refusing to publish a list of 260 councillorship and 17 chairmanship candidates it forwarded to the electoral body in December 2021.

Addressing the disenfranchised candidates and other party faithful at the State Secretariat at the weekend, Enugu APC chairman, Barr Ugochukwu Agballah, declared that the party would void the election should the electoral body exclude APC from participating in the exercise.

“Enugu must rise for democracy to thrive. There is no democracy in Enugu State; it’s been a government of cronyism and elitism… On Wednesday (February 23) the local government election will not be held; if they go ahead, it will be an exercise in futility,” he declared.

Agballah announced that the legal team of the party, led by a senior advocate of Nigeria, SAN had already filed a suit at the State High Court to void the election for unlawful exclusion, which he said was a breach of the Nigerian Constitution and the Electoral Act.

The APC chairman accused the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government in the state of colluding with some unscrupulous elements in the APC to manipulate ENSIEC in order to frustrate APC from participating in the council poll.

Agballah, who received his certificate of Returns from the APC national leadership on February 14, 2022, claimed that his emergence as the APC chairman in the state was causing fears within the ranks of the State Government and the ruling party who he accused of having been in the practice of writing election results in favour of the ruling party where they give themselves 100 percent victory in previous LG polls.

“ENSIEC disenfranchised all our candidates. We had our primaries to elect our chairmanship and councillorship candidates on December 18 and 19, 2021. We submitted the list to ENSIEC, which it accepted.","The Enugu State Government has announced that council polls will hold next.

"Drama as Niger Councillor chases govt officials with dogs, thugs","The Councillor representing Tundun Wada Ward in Chachanga local government area, Ibrahim Mai Farare, has chased away officials of the Niger State Environment Protection Agency (NSEPA) with dogs and thugs for inviting him to answer some questions on a proposed gas plant he is setting up within the community.

The Councillor is having a running battle with members of his ward over the proposed gas plant.

Residents in the community had called on the government and relevant agencies to put a stop to the plant, claiming it would be dangerous to safety in the community.

- Advertisement -

They argued there could be explosion owing to the many commercial activities in the community that require fire.

When The Nation visited the community, it was observed most traders fry beans and cheese with many bakeries and suya sellers also around.

To douse raging tension, some officials of the Niger State Environment Protection Agency met the Councillor with a letter of invitation last week.

But they were chased away by dogs and thugs who beat them up.

Although the Councillor did not reply to calls by The Nation, he confirmed the development on a live radio show on Crusaders Radio in Minna.

When asked about the incident on air, the Councillor said: “Yes, I killed them, I did not only pursue them, I killed them.”

One of the residents of the community, Usman Galadima Mohammed, who called in on the live show, also confirmed the incident.

He said thugs beat the NSEPA staff mercilessly before dogs chased them away.

A top Senior Official of NSEPA told The Nation in confidence that the agency has charged the Councillor to the court, describing him as too arrogant and a village champion.

The Official disclosed that there is no approval for the setting up of a gas plant in the community.

Some of the residents however claimed that the Councillor is not the owner of the gas plant but protecting the owner after allegedly collecting N200,000.

Nigeria needs more rebels to move forward – Obasanjo,"Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that Nigeria requires honest people as rebels to move her forward.

Obasanjo said people who live life of honesty and integrity have to also be rebels, explaining that life of honesty and integrity embolden one to speak truth to power, not caring a hoot whose ox is gored.

The elder statesman spoke yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, at the unveiling of the autobiography of the Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, as part of the celebration of his(Sowunmi) 80th birthday.

The autobiography titled “Footprints Of A Rebel,” was reviewed by Hafsat Abiola – Costello, daughter of the late politician, MKO Abiola, and founder of Kudirat Initiative for Democracy.

According to Obasanjo, having honest people as rebels remained one of the greatest assets for rebuilding a nation.

He lauded the octogenarian and former activist for living an exemplary life worthy of emulation by the younger generation.

“Looking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel? But it is good.

“But the truth is that if you have to leave a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel. There would be some time you would be asked to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that, you will become a rebel. You may even become a persona non grata.

“There is no country that we can call our own except Nigeria. Our country, Nigeria, needs more rebels. Those who would look at things straight in the face and say ‘this is not good for Nigeria,” Obasanjo said.

"APC convention: Govs split, may revolt against Buni committee","By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation and Jide Orintunsin, Abuja

Confusion over aspirants’ letter demanding postponement

Party fails to set up convention sub-committees

State chairmen go underground over moves to replace coordinator

The cloud over the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 hung still last night with the party’s governors split into two camps.

The issues in contention are whether the convention should proceed as scheduled and which of the six geo-political zones should produce the party’s next national chairman.

Adding to the uncertainties was the emergence of a letter yesterday by some party members seeking offices at the convention to propose the postponement of the meeting.

- Advertisement -

Some party office holders dissociated themselves from the letter.

It was also gathered that many state chairmen of the party have gone underground to resist an attempt to coerce them to sign a document on convention shift.

This development, sources told The Nation, prompted the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to conclude plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno) with his Taraba State counterpart to force others in line to endorse postponement.

The pro-shift governors are said to have proposed that the CECPC should keep running the affairs of the party until after the conduct of the primaries for the 2023 polls.

The same forces have been trying in the last 72 hours to force the state chairmen of APC chapters to sign a communiqué to demand the postponement of the convention.

Most of the chairmen have gone underground to resist the coercion to sign a document on convention shift.

The governors also remain divided over the zone that will produce the next national chairman of the party.

Although the governors had conceded the slot to the North-Central, some governors reneged and opted to prevail on a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, from the North-East.

Most of the governors have however rejected the Dogara option by insisting on conceding the office to North-Central.

Investigation by our correspondent revealed that most members of the Caretaker Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni subscribed to the postponement of the convention, but it has been difficult for the committee to table it before the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF).

It was learnt that the committee was afraid of a ‘likely revolt’ against the Buni-led committee.

Attempts by some governors to prevail on state APC chairmen to call for the postponement of the convention have also failed.

Most of the party chairmen at the state level are said to have “gone underground.”

Some governors supporting the retention of the Caretaker Committee and the postponement of the convention have not been able to gain the control of the PGF to achieve their aim.

A governor, who spoke in confidence, said: “The battle at hand is for the soul of the party. The CECPC members including Buni are in support of the postponement of the convention. It is emerging to all of us that Buni appears interested in the presidency in 2023.

“Buni’s personal, vaulting ambition is what’s driving him, but he doesn’t know how to even discuss this with us – his supposed allies who put him on the job

“All the governors are opposed to convention shift except Yahaya Bello (Kogi), who is a presidential aspirant, Hope Uzodinma (Imo) and Ben Ayade (Cross River).

“These anti-convention governors cannot constitute themselves into Progressive Governors Forum (PGF). They are in the minority and they don’t even want the same thing.

“One wants to be President, the other (Uzodinma) wants to be vice president to a Northern candidate. What unites them is that they are not keen on the unity of APC but they will eventually lose out.

“We are 22 and they are either three or four. We know the President will go by the position of the majority because he is democratic.

“Up till now, they cannot officially announce a postponement because they know the President’s position. Instead, they are using sleight of hand. They are in charge. If they want a postponement, why hide behind one finger?”

Responding to a question, the governor said Buni and the CECPC were in a fix.

The governor added: “Mai Mala cannot do it (postponement) because he knows the views of the majority of governors including first term governors. They were trying to play a divide and rule card between first and second term governors but we insisted that the right thing must be done.”

A party source claimed that most state APC chairmen have gone underground to avoid being forced to sign any communiqué for the postponement of the convention.

It was also confirmed by another governor that all his colleagues have directed their party chairmen “not to endorse any document on postponement of the convention.”

“I think those who may have signed are those from Taraba, Yobe, Kogi and Imo states. Others have gone underground, having been directed by their governors to ignore convention postponement drive.

“In frustration, the CECPC has concluded plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno) with his counterpart from Taraba State, Tukur El-Sudi Ibrahim, to pave the way for the postponement of the convention to March 12 or indefinitely.

“Yet all the state APC chairmen came together to elect their leaders through a democratic process. Why will the CECPC be making moves to remove Dalori if they have nothing to hide?”

Findings confirmed that governors were divided over zoning of the office of the national chairman of APC.

It was gathered that before President Muhammadu Buhari travelled to Brussels, he had built consensus among the governors to concede the office to the North-Central.

Some governors however reneged on the pact by shopping for a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, as the next APC national chairman.

An APC governor simply said: “Mark my words; our next Chairman is from the North-Central.

“Mai Mala should go back home and concentrate on his job as governor.”

Aspirants in letter to CECPC, seek shift of convention

A forum of aspirants for offices at the convention yesterday sparked a fresh confusion in the party when they wrote an open letter to the CECPC to shift the Congress.

The shift, according to them, is for the sake of peace, unity and success of the party in next year’s elections.

In the letter signed by Maxwell Yakubu Gowon, an aspirant for National Youth Leader and Chairman of All Aspirants Forum, and Hon. Mohammed Bala Mohammed, an aspirant for National Secretary who also doubles as Secretary for the Forum, the forum claimed that the Abdullahi Adamu led Reconciliatory Committee failed in its assignment, leaving the party divided down the line.

The forum said the committee “complicated the issues at stake by refusing to look at issues holistically and relied on rumours and hearsays in coming to a conclusion in its report.”

It added: “The implication of the above statement is that those that were meant to be reconciled ended up infuriated by the actions of the reconciliatory committee.

“The signs in this regard are evident for every well-meaning member of the APC to see. But they have elected in their wisdom to downplay these contentious issues in the report submitted.

“This, in our opinion, is a great disservice to your efforts at positioning the APC for electoral success. As you may be aware, the public space has been flooded with narratives that paint the APC as a party of strange bedfellows whose interests are propelled primarily for self-aggrandizement.

“Mr Chairman may wish to critically examine the various agitations in the different states in the country. The feelers are not pleasant, and with the benefit of hindsight, it would indeed spell doom if the party goes ahead with the national convention under such circumstances.

“As a party, we must be mindful of the burden of expectation placed on our shoulders in providing credible leadership to the country.

“Suppose we can’t put our house in order. In that case, we do not have any moral justification for promising the country credible leadership because charity must begin from home.”

Chairmanship aspirants distance themselves from letter

Some national chairmanship aspirants however distanced themselves from the letter.

Contacted on the phone, one of the chairmanship aspirants, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, said: “I am not aware of any forum, neither am I aware of any letter advising the Caretaker Committee Chairman to postpone the convention.”

Also reacting to our correspondent’s enquiry, another chairmanship hopeful, Malam Saliu Mustapha, who spoke through the Media Coordinator of his Campaign Organisation, Dapo Okubanjo, said: “We are not aware of the existence of the so-called All Aspirants Forum headed by an aspirant for the position of National Youth leader. So they can’t claim to be speaking for all aspirants, especially as we have never been invited to any meeting where such a decision was said to have been reached.

“We respect and trust the capacity of the leadership of the party to deal with the issues at stake,” Mustapha maintained.

Chief Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe, another chairmanship aspirant, said: “While conceding to the fact that we are in a democracy and everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I make bold to say that problems will always exist and healing them is a process.

“Leadership at all levels is a continuum, and if anyone claims that we must clear everything, reconcile every difference before proceeding, we will be making a big error.

“The idea of continuity is to state all pending issues in your handover note.

“I want to appeal to the Gov Mai Mala Buni led CECPC to have that in their minds and decide on the next line of action which I believe should be by tomorrow evening, Sunday the 20th of February.

“Having said that, we must remember that our word should be our bond; they (CECPC) chose the date of 26th February on their own and should not lose their sense of integrity by doing something that will bring their integrity to question.”

Convention sub-committees yet to be constituted

Members of the party waited in vain again yesterday for the constitution of the sub-committees for the convention.

The Caretaker Committee at its 19th regular meeting of 19th January 2022 had fixed Saturday 19th February for the release of the membership of the sub-committees and their inauguration.

The caretaker committee also fixed the same day as the last day for the submission of nomination forms by all aspirants.

There were no activities suggestive of an upcoming convention at party’s national secretariat in Abuja yesterday.

No member of the Caretaker Committee was even seen at the secretariat.","This development, sources told The Nation, prompted the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to conclude plans to replace the Chairman of State APC Chairmen Forum, Hon.

"2023 presidency: Why move to lure Jonathan into APC will fail – Aminu Wali, former Foreign Affairs minister","From Desmond Mgboh, Kano

Ambassador Aminu Wali is Nigeria’s former minister of Foreign Affairs and a founding father of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

In this chat with Sunday Sun in his home in Kano, he speaks about the challenges and fortunes of his party, the PDP.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Specifically, he talked about the party’s Northwest congress, which has been shifted twice as a result of disruption in the first instance and recently, as a result of an injunction against a rather popular candidate in the race, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo.

He also lamented over the negative impacts of the Kwankwasiyya Movement – a Movement led by Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso – on the party, the overarching pressure brought by strong governors on the PDP, the moves to lure Jonathan to APC as well as the dilemma of the PDP regarding which zone, North or South, should produce its 2023 presidential candidate. Excerpts:

Let’s start the interview with the efforts of your party to hold a congress in the Northwest zone. What is your impression of what has happened so far, with two postponement of the congress already?

It is unfortunate about what has happened, that has led to the postponement of the scheduled congress. I think luckily, what we have in place today in terms of the national leadership of our party is a leadership that looks at things fairly, that is fair to everybody. It is unfortunate that some people went and got an injunction against one of the candidates, for which they know that they cannot expel or they cannot suspend him. Legally, they don’t have the authority under the Constitution of the party to suspend or expel a member of the BOT. The constitution is very clear. Even the National Executive Committee of the party cannot suspend or expel a member of the BOT of the party.

Are you referring to Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo, the candidate that was barred by their injunction?

Yes, Bello Hayaitu Gwarzo. As you know, Gwarzo is a member of the BOT and the Constitution of the PDP is very clear and by the end of the day, it is only the convention that can expel or suspend him or the BOT itself that can suspend him. And if it is expulsion, it is the convention that can expel him. So, this is a Kangaroo thing that was done. But then, when a court gave an injunction to stop Gwarzo from contesting, the party felt that the premise upon which the injunction was secured may not have taken into consideration the Constitution of the party and the party said well, to be fair to everybody, the congress is postponed, so that the legal issues would be sorted out and thereafter, we can go back to have a zonal congress. That is what happened.

What I worry here is time. Does your party have all the time?

Well, yes! Don’t forget that there is already a caretaker executive in place at the zone, which has been handling all the issues. But of course, that is not satisfactory. We certainly want an elected body to do it, but since the current leadership is very much aware of the legal implications, it decided to say okay we cannot just go and support what we know is not legal – that is to support one of the candidates. But since the court has made a pronouncement, we have to obey the court. But for that purpose, they said okay, let’s just suspend the zonal congress so that everybody would be given a fair and level playing ground.

Still on the aborted Northwest zonal congress of your party, there are two candidates from Kano State vying for the deputy chairman. Why is it that almost all of you, the major stakeholders of the party in the zone are opposed the Kwankwassiya candidate?

Don’t forget that I am one of the founding fathers of this party. I was the first deputy national chairman of the PDP. Solomon Lar was chairman and I was his deputy. For me, it is the party that I know. Any other identification within the party, to me, is unacceptable. Our loyalties should be to the party. So, you can see, even without me giving any explanation, you can see why we are running at parallel lines with that movement you just mentioned. I don’t belong to any movement. I belong to the PDP. And any other body that identifies with me, it is not me as a person, It is the party that he identifies. So, somehow, somehow, there is a movement that sprang up around a particular personality, but they still claim to be a part of the PDP.

Sir, from your rich experiences in party politics, what is your take on movements loyal to a particular individual emerging within parties? I mean a movement like Kwankwasiyya Movement, whose loyalty is first to a particular personality?

Well, you see once we have the right leadership leading any political party, this kind of thing would not happen or would not be allowed to happen. This is because there would be limit, a red line which every member of the party cannot cross. But unfortunately, we have not been that cohesive at the national level of the party for some time now. But thank God, for the first time since the departure of Solomon Lar, this current leadership of the PDP, the national leader of the party, happens to be one of the founding fathers of the party. And so, he knows the principles and the basic philosophy of the party and also what really brought people together to form the PDP. At least, he has a perception of what the PDP should be. And I don’t think he would tolerate this movement stuff, I don’t think he would tolerate anything meddling into the administration of the party- like having a different movement whose loyalty is not to the party leadership. For us, the national party leader is our sole leader. No more, no less! Nobody who is not elected within the hierarchy of the party can be a leader to me. Whatever movement it is, regardless, should not arrogate itself the authority that can compete or disregard the party national leadership- because this is what is happening.

You don’t like talking about the Kwankwasiyya Movement, but it is real. How would you access their impact on the PDP in Kano State and beyond? Have they added value to the party or have been a cross for the party to bear?

I think that, initially, when they started, some people took them in good faith. They saw them as members of the party. And felt innocently that it was not really built around a particular individual. They saw it like another brand to bring people into the PDP and they were somehow okay with it, but unfortunately as it turned out, it turned out like a cult within the PDP. And that has not augured well for the PDP in the state and beyond. Initially when it was looked at as nothing harmless, yes, it added value. Kids, one way or the other, wanted to be identified with the PDP if they wear one thing or the other. But as it is, it seems that it is now built around a particular individual as opposed to around the party. If it is around the party, by now everybody who is a member of the PDP would be wearing or would be identified with the colours. But no! It got to a point where it is operating like worshipping the leader of the movement. Number two, it contradicts every democratic norm, all the democratic norms of running, not even a party, but any society of people. If there is democracy, then everybody will and should have a voice. At whatever level, there cannot be only one person that can determine everything. So, that is the difference. So, for Kano today, if things go the way it is going, I will be very, very sorry for our young people that are now coming up. The political culture that is being nurtured in the party would not augur well in the future because number one, discipline is broken down. I have been a victim. I am sure you know what happened to me. In a society, no matter what, respect for elders is always inculcated in the youth. And they have always respected that. That is how our society was and any society in Nigeria is built around that culture. But eventually that culture of respect in Kano is being eroded arising from the emergence of this sort of movements.

There is a new PDP national leadership today. Do you see this team of leadership as the type that can fight APC and their incumbency to a standstill by 2023?

Absolutely, absolutely. Like I said earlier, the spirit of the founding fathers of the PDP is now brought to the fore. The founding fathers of the party fought the military and succeeded, let alone fighting a rival democratic institution like the APC and its incumbency. We were there before and we know how the game is played. The current leadership was part and parcel of the first PDP government. Iyorchia Ayu was a minister in that government. So, he knows the values and the programmes and the achievements of the PDP within that 16 years of governance and today, he is at the helm of affairs of the party. And I believe that very soon, we would start seeing a lot of people, a lot of Nigerians trooping back to the PDP because a lot of people have a lot of confidence in Ayu’s emergence. Like I said, I have absolute confidence in Ayu- because we worked with him in the national secretariat, he was a member of the 34, he was first Chairman’s Political Adviser when I was Deputy Chairman to Solomon Lar. He was his Principle Political Adviser. And most of the political thinking of that era owe itself to Ayu’s input. So he is very much conversant, in fact, he is the most qualified person within the PDP to really drive the new vision of the party. The previous leadership of the PDP led by Secondus.

They are still around, they are still agitating and they still feel that they should not have been removed they way they were removed. Don’t you see them as a threat to all these goals and new vision?

Whether we like it or not, I was party to the emergence of that administration. Secondus was at my house where he was interviewed by all the stakeholders of my zone (Northwest zone) before we agreed to go along with him. At that time, we all believed that things would work out well. But I think that somehow, along the way, there was a derailment. PDP is people’s democratic party. It is not owned by any individual or organization. It is our own, all of us, all Nigerians, and whoever wants to identify with the PDP, owns a piece of the party. And there is a constitution which was carefully crafted by people who are well qualified and with amendments here and there as we go on. For the PDP to succeed, we have to adhere strictly to the constitution of the party. But unfortunately, the last administration vied away from the basic principles of the constitution of the party. In fact, if they had adhered strictly to the constitution of the party, then, movements like Kwankwasiyya could not been tolerated. The constitution does not provide for any movement within the party. But somehow, it was tolerated and encouraged. When Kwankwassiyya movement came out from the APC to the PDP in Kano State, they came in as Kwankwassiyya Movement. That would not have happened under the current leadership. If you come in, you come in as a member of the PDP and your movement is something that is totally outside the party structure. So, my vision of the current leadership or my confidence in the current leadership is to the effect that I know that the driver is a good driver and would take us safely to our destination. My only appeal is to those aspirants for political offices, particularly aspirants to the number one position to please tread carefully, for the party to come up with the right kind of person that is generally accepted, both within the party and across the country.

There is the assumption that the PDP is now under the control of some strong governors, strong governors like Wike and his friend in Sokoto, Tambuwal, and that these governors dictate the tune and not the elected leadership. May we have your view on this?

This is a very sad situation. But it evolved over the years. It would be unfair to blame the last administration alone. PDP started stumbling within the first administration. If I could remember, a lot of the provisions within the constitution and the way that the PDP was being run were taken from the former parties, particularly the NPN of which I was part of. The party, from what I know of the NPN, the party is supreme. Whether you are the governor or the president, you have to go with what the party dictates, when I say the party, I mean everybody, not a certain group of individuals sitting down to decide. But unfortunately, over the years – maybe it is as a result of lack of resources or the party was unable to create ways of raising its own resources and it was depending on the largesse that was coming from the governors and even from the presidency as it was when we were in power. Eventually, through the process, the party began to lose its grips. Because when we came into office in 1999, as a member of the national caucus, we used to meet every week when we first started, every week with the president and his ministers and his nominees, BOT, every week and get reports of what the government was doing. It eventually went to bi-weekly and then somehow along the line, it just fizzled out. That is where I think the party lost track. It didn’t lose track now as in today or yesterday. This problem took time to evolve to what it is today.

What is the solution?

The solution is strong leadership.

And what is your appeal?

Let us now learn to be fair to one another, whether you are the governor or the chairman of the PDP or whatever. Let us be fair to the party and the only way to be fair to each other is to allow the party and constitution to be referee to all the players. They must give the party the chance to be the referee. Just like in a football game, the referee is the sole authority in the game. And the party should be given the authority to make sure that there is fairness in whatever that is being done. And at the same time, the party should think of how to independently generate funds – I think Ayu has started. I saw him going to visit the national secretariat that we started building some years ago. When that structure in the center of Abuja is completed, I think the party would depend less on any individual for funds.

Only recently, the PDP national chairman paid a visit to Obasanjo to canvas his blessings and invite him to the party, but I think the signal in the media was that Obasanjo turned down the offer to return to the PDP. How do you see this?

No! He did not turn down the offer, it was not a question of turning down. Obasanjo has already made his position clear a long time ago, that he is no longer, I mean, he is now a statesman, not only in Nigeria but in Africa, in fact, in the world. And I worked very closely with Obasanjo when I was in the United Nations and I know the kind of respect that the man commanded at the international level. So, I think that he had realized that at his age, he should not be drawn into party politics and all these things. But deep down, he still cannot acquit himself of his preference. If we sit down , me and him sit down, talking, I still can see the flicker of his preference to PDP than any other party in Nigeria! But for him to now come out and say that I am going to be partisan, some of the assignments and some of the activities that he is undertaking at the moment cannot continue. He has had recognition in Africa, recognition internationally. So, I think he is trying to protect what he has going for him now. His position as a statesman may not be accommodated by the narrowness of a particular political party, but deep inside him, his thinking is definitely PDP.

The PDP appears to be in a dilemma in terms of whose region should produce its presidential candidate, North or South, for the 2023 elections. What is your position?

Well, you see for me, my antecedents are very clear. When we went to the party’s convention in Jos, I was an Ekwueme’s man. I supported him to the end and up to the time the man died, I still maintained that relationship with him. For me, my solution for the Nigeria’s problem at that time was to get an Igbo man to become the president after the civil war, to get an Igbo man to take over the country. My belief was and is still is that if Ekwueme had become the president of Nigeria, all these Biafra stuff would have been long forgotten. All these things would have been put to rest, if only we had allowed an Igbo presidency at that time. If we had Ekwueme then as president, nobody would come and agitate for Biafra today. Yes, maybe the Yourba was shortchanged when Abiola was not sworn in, but that is one thing you and me cannot be accused of. But today what we need, from my point of view, what I believe is that we need a change of government in Nigeria, we need the PDP back to power to take us back to eight years ago, where the APC took over because things have really gone bad, things have become so bad in this country in every aspect.

We are talking about that we need…?

Yes, we need to win 2023 general elections and for me, I don’t care where the person comes from so long as the person is capable and can win elections for our party. It should be somebody that can break the barriers of all the zones in this country to be able to emerge as a presidential candidate. There is demand for Igbo president, Yoruba president or a Northern president or whatever president. Yes it is a legitimate right for everybody to voice out his preference, but I hope that within the PDP, we are going to come back to our senses and really look at the aspirants, sit down to look at them and in the same spirit that we were able to produce the chairman of the party, that same spirit should guide us to produce a winner candidate for the presidency of this country, regardless of where the person comes from.

If I get you right now, the emphasis is how to get a winner kind of candidate?

Exactly, because we we have to do something to get rid of where we are today and then we can now return back to our zoning. I want a winnable candidate from whichever part of the country. Let us accept the candidate so that we can go ahead and win the elections and once we win the elections, then we can now sit down within the PDP and within the larger society also to see how do we now satisfy the aspiration of every Nigerian from every part of the country, maybe come up with a new formula like the initial thinking .Yes the initial thinking was to move rotation to all the six zones and after that , there should be no more rotation. But unfortunately, Obasanjo finished and Yar’dua died. That was what brought about the complications. The people are crying that the North has ruled. Yes, it has ruled. But they had APC and we have PDP. We have ruled for 16 years as PDP, but those 16 years were not from the North. I am trying to justify anything , no ! For now, forget about where the candidate would come from , let us get a winnable candidate.

There is a suggestion that to ease this form of challenge, let’s cut down the tenure to one –tenure stuff, so that the presidency can go easily round to the zones. What is your view on this?

This is something that can be visited and be accepted. Because you see this two term business, once somebody gets to the Villa, he does not want to hear anything that would curtail his tenure. We would now have to have a national consensus across all parties that it should be one term presidency. I am totally in agreement with that. Maybe we make one term – five-year presidency, so that another zone will come and take charge so that this question of “we have been left out” would be over. After that, it is going to be purely on merit. We really have to learn to be Nigerians and to be our brother’s keepers regardless of from whichever part anybody comes from. Like I was saying, I never regretted supporting Ekwueme. I remember Obasanjo came to this house to seek my support and I told him Sir, I have known you before EKwueme, but Ekwueme has been my political soul mate.

There is still this speculation that somehow former President Goodluck Jonathan is still being lured back to the political field and APC may field him as their presidential candidate.

Jonathan is my boss and I served as his minister and I respect him and Jonathan is his own man, his own person. No matter how close we are with him, at the end of the day, that decision is his, not mine , not that of anybody. But as far as I know, he is still a member of the PDP. Yes, he has not been happy, apparently, from the way things were going and that is why he has not been too much involved in the affairs of the PDP. And maybe secondly, he’s got an alternative by being engaged in a lot of these African affairs, moving all over Africa, trying to sort out democratic issues…You want my opinion on what?

Should he move on with the offer or should he not?

I doubt it very much, knowing the man and what he is. I doubt if he would take that offer. I doubt it because I think he is already enjoying tremendous amount of respect, nationally and internationally, that going back, trying to go and start fighting against his own party that brought him up, that I think would be a tall order. I don’t think so, and in particular, for him to go and contest in the APC. For me, I will never forget the vitriolic attacks that we got from the APC, particular on him as a person. They even termed him the sponsor of Boko Haram. Some of us were vilified in our won states. They said that we have recanted our religion because we were supporting Jonathan. My house nearly got burnt at a time. So, he knows all these things that happened and it was not anybody’s doing at that time, but the APC’s doing. So, I don’t think that he would succumb to any pressure from the APC. That is number one. This is all rumour! It is rumour!! But how about the stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress that are gunning for that same position? Are they going to sit down and say okay we accept somebody from outside to come and take it? Does it make sense to you that those gunning for the presidency in APC would come and say okay we are settled for an outsider to come and take over?

It is not your party, but what is your take about the current struggle between Vice President Osinbajo and Bola Tinubu for their party’s presidential ticket?

The truth is that I know less or little about these people, to be honest with you. To some extent, yes I know Bola Tinubu, but Osinbajo, I have never met him since he became the vice president. Even since he became the vice president, I have never met him officially, not even once. So, I am not too much attached to the politics of the Southwest and most of the people that I am attached to in the region are not from the APC and even though some of them had moved to the APC from the PDP, when they move, they cut off automatically.

Seven years down the line, how would access President Buhari’s leadership bearing in mind the three major promises that he made to Nigerians when he was canvassing votes?

This administration took over from us and I know how far we went… all those projects that they are now claiming that they have done. Yes, we initiated them. Even the institution fighting corruption, it is our making. On security, what will I say? Let you or any other Nigerian compare between then and now. I don’t have to comment. This is something which is known to all Nigerians. Today, no part of Nigeria is spared. At least in our days, maybe we can say that it was limited to the Northeast But today, no part of Nigeria as far as security is related is secured. People dare not travel by road today to any part of Nigeria. Talking about security, I don’t want to comment. In those days, we all travel by road. But today the roads have all gone bad and secondly you dare not because the roads are not safe. So, what security are you talking about?","From Desmond Mgboh, KanoAmbassador Aminu Wali is Nigeria’s former minister of Foreign Affairs and a founding father of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

"Contaminated fuel: Season of pain, sorrow","• Affected filling stations confused on how to evacuate adulterated petrol imported from Belgium

• Motorists, commuters suffer as product price skyrockets

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

By Adewale Sanyaolu

The recent importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) popularly called petrol said to be high in methanol content has continued to spark outrage across the country over its attendant socio-economic effect on the citizenry.

The development has led to acute shortage of petrol with the majority of depots and filling stations running out of stock.

Motorists now have to keep vigil at filling stations as the price of a litre of petrol has skyrocked to N200 and N400 respectively in Lagos and Abuja.

Commeneting on the development, the Independent Petroleum Marketers

Association of Nigeria (IPMAN)

disclosed that no inland depot has received clean petrol that would boost supply to filling stations.

IPMAN Public Relations Officer, Chinedu Ukadike, said the Federal Government was yet to improve supply, warning that it would take another two

weeks for supply to normalize.

In Abuja, there was no sign of let-up in the shortage of petrol as fewer stations were opened to motorists with black marketers selling at N400 per litre.

Ukadike said that the challenges facing the downstream sector were

enormously, urging the government to begin the process of compensating marketers who have lost a lot of money during the period.

He explained: “Nothing much has changed in the last few days, the issue is that up till now we have not seen the intervention of the NNPC based on evacuating these products (bad fuel) from some of our stations. Some marketers are trying to see if they can get new products and blend it to see if they can move.

“Marketers’ capitals have been tied down and the bad product is also occupying their storage tank and that is why you are seeing some skeletal services. Some also have their tanks quarantined, so it is not easy.

“We have been expecting products in the inland depots like the Port Harcourt Refinery depot but up till now, no product has been received. These things happen. Once there is a break in the supply chain it will take some time to fix. Forget what people are saying, it will take one-two to three weeks to fill in the gaps. It is talking about evacuating and replacing, it is not just about the shortage, it is also about evacuating and replacing.”

He noted that while Port Harcourt where he is based has not witnessed the acute shortage being experienced in many parts of the country, he said most of the marketers who have placed orders have not received the supply.

While urging consumers to be patient, he observed that many motorists have engaged in racketeering where they “fill up their tanks, go to sell to black marketers and return to the queues. I want to advise our people to stop patronizing black marketers, this will help also in solving the problem”, he added.

However, the claim of IPMAN contradicted the position of NNPC which said that it has over one billion litres of certified petrol stock that is safe for use in vehicles and machinery.

The NNPC in a statement released on Tuesday equally said that it has commenced 24-hour operations in NNPC depots and retails outlets to restore normal supply and distribution of petrol across the country.

But, a Twitter user, Anthony Unegbu, while responding to the NNPC statement said that the reality on ground does not support the content of the press statement.

‘‘Why did NNPC depot at Aba not sell even one litre of petrol yesterday (February 15, 2022)? People have payments made since over two months and the tickets have not been released. Prove me wrong by showing pictures,’’ he queried.

There have equally been widespread reported cases of damage to vehicle engines occasioned by the adulterated fuel.

An online video which surfaced recently shows a petrol attendant complaining about how the adulterated petrol dispensed at the station damaged cars and motorcycle engines.

While pointing at some of the grounded vehicles, he said many motorists have reported the matter to the police.

Some of the motorists who spoke to Sunday Sun in separate interviews said, if not urgently addressed, the situation was capable of further pushing more Nigerians below the poverty net.

‘‘Should my vehicle be damaged as a result of this contaminated fuel, who will bail me out? How do I feed my family and other family members that depend on me for survival,” Mufu Akande, a transporter who plies CMS to Ajah queried.

In a telephone interview with Sunday Sun, Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Mr. Babatunde Irukera, while sympatising with those whose vehicles may have been damaged due to the adulterated petrol said that the FCCPC was already in talks with NMDPRA, NNPC, Standards Organisation of Nigeria(SON) on the way forward.

He said that FCCPC will collate data on those affected and develop a methodology on how best to resolve the issue.

He admitted that the issue remained a complicated one, but that the FCCPC will not rest on its oars in order to ensure that consumers are not left in the cold.

The adulterated petrol according to the regulator-Nigerian Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority(NMDPRA) has proved to be high in methanol concentration.

Upon the discovery of the adulterated fuel, NMDPRA in conjunction with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited commenced moves to recall the bad product in order to save Nigerians, especially motorists untold hardship.

But prior to its recall, the adulterated fuel had already found its way into the Nigerian petroleum retail products market.

The outcome of the penetration of the bad product into the Nigerian market was a monumental damage to motor vehicle engines, generators and other mechanical devices that use petrol as its source of energy.

Addressing the media on the adulterated imported petrol, Chief Executive Officer(CEO) of NNPC Limited, Mr Mele Kyari, made a shocking revelation when he admitted that a subsidiary of NNPC, Duke Oil Limited and three other private Nigerian company operating in the downstream sector imported four PMS cargoes which contained methanol.

He listed the three other companies to include; MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium and Oando.

He said that NNPC investigation revealed the presence of Methanol in four PMS cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando, and Duke Oil.

Kyari added that the adulterated fuel was imported into the country from Antwerp in Belgium with quality inspectors failing to detect the high level of Methanol contained in it, first at the point of import in Belgium and later at the point of arrival in Nigeria.

The NNPC boss who did not give the date of import, however, disclosed that the NNPC found out about the situation late in January following a report received from their quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in PMS cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.

MRS used the vessel, MT Bow Pioneer; Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium imported the product via the vessel MT Tom Hilde; Oando used the vessel MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil imported its PMS using MT Nord Gainer.

Kyari explained that the PMS contained methanol was not detected by checks because the quality checks do not include checks for Methanol percentage, adding that cargoes quality certificates issued at load port (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicated that the gasoline complied with Nigerian specification.

He also said that the NNPC quality inspectors, including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G as well as inspection agents appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority certified that the cargoes met Nigerian specification.","• Affected filling stations confused on how to evacuate adulterated petrol imported from Belgium• Motorists, commuters suffer as product price skyrocketsNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home.

I feel better acting bad girl character,"By Christian Agadibe

Star actress, Chinenye Uyanna always looks stunning acting pregnant woman even though she’s still single.

Recently, Uyanna took to her Instagram page to showcase a baby bump, a role she played in her new movie, Jackie’s Baby Bump. Ironically, in this rare interview, the actress cum movie producer opens up on why she cannot act romantic or sexual roles. Here are excerpts:

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

What are you currently working on?

I am working on having my own production outfit. And I am supposed to start a job on February 12, and I will also be producing a lot of films this year.



What was the first movie you produced?

It’s called Time, starring Mike Ezuronye and a lot of other popular acts. The second one is titled Mended Heart. I also acted in it. Both movies are on TV and YouTube channels. So, I have done three movies. The other one, Baby Bump will come out this month.

Which among these movies is your favourite?

All of them are doing great, even though Mended Heart is doing wonderfully well on YouTube. Of course, all my babies are doing great. My movies are my babies.

Which of the characters gave you a tough time?

I think it is Baby Bump; it is not easy to be pregnant in movies. Carrying that belle for long was really challenging, and the same thing happened in Jackie`s Baby Bump, which would be out in February.

How can you describe the acceptance of the movie?

Time and even Mended Heart are doing great. A lot of people love the storyline as it is all about ‘for better for worse’ between partners, and there are lessons to be learnt. So, I will advise you to go watch it.

How challenging was it producing movies after recovering from the COVID-19 saga?

Really, everything was okay; we kept to the rules, we used hand sanitizer and facemasks.



How do you manage to combine both roles as producer and actor?

It is not that difficult if you have able hands. Uche Ibunabu, my producer really helped. I think people that complain are those that want to carry everything on their heads, there should be people assisting you. So, for me, all I do is bring out the money for the production, then relax and shoot.

What can you say has changed in the industry?

We are growing; it is not how you were as a baby that you are now as an adult. As for me, I’m not sentimental; everyone that comes for my shoot must behave him or herself, even if we are friends or colleagues or family members.

Can you say that young actresses constitute a sort of threat to you?

Nobody is a threat to me. The earth is too big for everybody, and knowing that you cannot be in every movie, but can only do what you can do. What I bring to the table is different from what you bring to the table, so we all have different talents and ideas. Nobody is a threat to me and I am equally not a threat to anybody. I do my thing and focus on myself and work.



What can you say about comedy skits that seem to be taking over Nollywood?

Let’s call a spade a spade. Comedy is comedy. When it comes to comedy, it’s not even up to 10 minutes, it is something to laugh at and move on. But when you want something to learn from, obviously, it’s a movie. Even people no longer pay for cables but go on YouTube to watch their movies. So, we cannot say social media is taking over Nollywood, as it can only take a few minutes of skits. However, both are two different things. I do cartoon skits myself and I know a lot of people don’t know that.

Have you ever done any movie involving romantic or sexual scenes?

I always tell producers not to bother involving me in such movies, because I cannot do it. And I think everybody around me is used to it. If there is no lesson that people can take home from a movie, then there is no need doing it. You know, a lot of people keep complaining about Nollywood films.

Can you say Nollywood films are making an impact in Nigerian politics?

Yes, a lot of things are happening, and thank God for social media, especially during the #EndSARS protest of October 2020. A lot of people came out to lend their voices, including celebrities who used their platforms in terms of speaking out.

Has acting denied you of anything?

Not at all, acting cannot deny me of anything, because my fame came with favours.

Would you encourage any of your children to join the movie industry?

Of course, I would like my daughter to feature in Nollywood if that is what she wants.

What can you say about female celebrities flaunting their big cars, houses on social media?

How do you know I don’t have big cars? That I don’t post things on social media does not mean I do not have something. I don’t need anybody to congratulate me on anything. And I don’t think it’s just me, I think a lot of the male celebrities are also buying big cars, even if they don’t post them. I can even say the actors are doing far better than the female ones; it’s just that we ladies like to show off.



What’s your take on cheating husbands and their wives retaliating by also indulging in extra-marital affairs?

Well, I don’t know about that. For me, I would not do such. We just have to come to terms with whatever situation we find ourselves and have forgiven spirit, realising that nobody is perfect. But if you cannot do that, you move on; marriage is not a do-or-die affair.

Going forward, what should your fans expect from you?

They should expect more films, more endorsements, and more everything good. With God on my side, a lot of good things will happen this year.

What other projects are you into?

I started my Foundation last year and there would be more outreaches this year. My Foundation is about reaching out to children, the young ones and the less privileged. So, you guys should watch out.

We don’t see you nowadays acting the bad girl character, any reason for this?

I do both. I started with the bad girl character. Sometimes I think they just look at your face and know what kind of person you are. I feel I do better when I’m acting the bad girl character, like a nagging wife, a troublesome sister etc.

Can you recall the experience of your first kiss in movies?

No, I can’t remember. How would you even remember something that is just an act?","Recently, Uyanna took to her Instagram page to showcase a baby bump, a role she played in her new movie, Jackie’s Baby Bump.

Uncertainty over APC planned national convention,"From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja

There is indeed uncertainty over the much-awaited National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled to hold on February 26.

Currently, the convention is shrouded in confusion, intrigues and anomie, amidst speculations of its possible postponement from February 26 to the first or second week of March.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

In line with the timetable and schedule of activities released last month January, the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) tactically raised a red flag of possible postponement of the convention when it failed to meet up with its deadline for sale and submission of nomination forms scheduled to hold between February 14 to 19.

Besides the failure to meet up with the deadline for the sale of forms, the national leadership of the ruling party could not equally constitute convention sub-committees, especially the zoning committee, which will swing the pendulum to decide, firstly, the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and ultimately the trajectory for the party’s 2023 presidential ticket.

Although the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) may have temporarily resolved the lingering zoning controversy by giving the national chairmanship ticket to the North-central geopolitical zone, the zoning of the National Secretary to the South-south has been causing serious ripples between the Southeast and South-south.

Explaining the bone of contention to Sunday Sun, a reliable source who declined identity on print, described it as a decision taken in error by a critical stake of the party’s leaders.

Questioning the basis for such decision, he argued that having produced the two previous national chairmen of the party in addition to occupation of the current position as Secretary Caretaker Committee, equity, fairness and natural justice demand that South-south should allow Southeast to produce the next chief scribe of the party in the about-to-be constituted NWC.

“There is likelihood that the convention might be postponed not because of any other thing, but probably because we want to avoid any possible clash with the bye-elections fixed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) coming on the same February 26 date.

“Yes the party has been under immense pressure to shift the date and without ruling out the possibility of the convention still holding as scheduled, I want to say that if there is going to be postponement of the date, the INEC bye-elections might be responsible for it.

“Again, the planned postponement has nothing to do with the lingering controversial issue of zoning or delay in setting up of sub-committees for the convention. For your information, the progressive governors have concluded the zoning arrangement, after their meeting in Abuja last week, by confirming that while the North-central will produce the National Chairman, the Southeast will take the National Secretary.

“They also reconfirmed that all the previous positions in the NWC held by the South should return to the North and vice-versa. However, I must tell you that there has been serious disagreement between South-south and Southeast over which zone should produce the next National Secretary.

“But, having produced two national chairmen of the party previously and currently occupies the Caretaker Committee secretaryship position, South-south should, in the spirit of fairness and equity, allow the Southeast to have the position.

“What it means is that should the North-central produce the party’s national chairman and the South-south the secretary, the Southeast would have lost out in everything should the party also fail to zone the presidential ticket to the Southeast” our source explained.

On why the party’s national leadership reneged in the implementation of its timetable and schedule concerning the sale of forms, our source further argued that there may not be any reason to sell nomination forms to the aspirants to the NWC since most of the positions will be filled through consensus arrangements, adding that the party may sell forms for only non-NWC positions.

“It is wrong to judge the readiness of the national leadership for our convention based on the failure to meet up with the timetable deadline on the sale and submission of nomination forms last week. There is likelihood that the party may not sell nomination forms for the NWC positions because almost all the positions may be through consensus arrangements.

“The nomination forms that might be on sale however could be for the non-NWC positions. Let me add that if the party’s leadership fail nomination forms this week, it will be a confirmation that the convention may not hold this weekend as earlier planned.

“Other factors that might necessitate the postponement of the convention might likely be the INEC bye-elections. As of today, I won’t say with certainty that the February proposed date for the convention is cast in stone. Don’t also forget that the bulk stops on the table of President Muhammadu Buhari. We must look beyond interpretation of his body language as far as this convention is concerned,” the source noted.

Doubting the possibility of the convention holding, many secretariat staff ruled out the February 26 date, arguing that the indices and signals are enough confirmation that the date might be changed.

“I wonder how anybody could still believe the possibility of the convention holding on February 26 with the way the secretariat is looking. There were no preconvention activities in the secretariat one week to the convention. There has not been any composition of sub-committees, acceptable resolutions on the controversial zoning arrangements, and more importantly the nomination forms that have not been printed.

“This secretariat used to be a beehive of activities a week to the convention, but in this case, the only semblance of the possibility of it holding is the marching order President Buhari gave to the Caretaker Committee to organise the convention unfailingly this month. Well, we will, however, get the clearer picture of whether it will hold or not this week,” the secretariat staff noted.","From Romanus Ugwu, AbujaThere is indeed uncertainty over the much-awaited National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled to hold on February 26.

"Osun APC primaries: Oyetola leads, as Aregbesola’s faction kicks","From Lateef Dada and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

Barring last minute change, Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State appears set to emerge the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the July governorship election in the state.

Oyetola who contested against the former Secretary to Osun State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, and former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Lasun Yusuf, was leading in the election conducted in all the wards across the 36 local government areas of the state.

Results released in many of the wards as at the time of filing this report showed that Oyetola was leading his opponents with a wide margin.

The former governor and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allegedly absconded from his ward in Ifofin ward 8, Ilesa East Local Government.

Aregbesola who led a faction of the APC, ‘The Osun Progressives (TOP), could not deliver his ward to his announced candidate, Moshood Adeoti. While Oyetola polled 309, Adeoti scored 146 in Aregbesola’s ward.

The Chairman of the APC faction in the ward, Adegoke Saheed, blamed the loss of the ward for the absence of Aregbesola, alleging that the committee favoured Governor Oyetola.

Findings revealed that Oyetola won in almost all the polling centres in the state, defeating both Adeoti and Yusuf.

However, a faction of the party loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, alleged that the election was marred by irregularities.

A statement issued by the publicity secretary of the faction, Mr Abiodun Agboola, alleged that the election was marred by a series of irregularities attributed to the faction loyal to Oyetola.

Agboola said: “We strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.

100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .

“Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, indicated that there were no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.

“Also, there was no proper accreditation in majority of the ward collation centres where voting took place. The accreditation done in some places were skewed in favour of Governor Gboyega Oyetola as members of the group were allowed to pass through accreditation process without much ado.

“Names of a sizeable number of members of the APC who wanted to vote for Adeoti were missing in the register of the party. This we had envisaged by calling for the display of party register before the conduct of the primary.

“We also need to inform the general public that appointees of Governor Oyetola were used as collation officers, which made the rigging plan of Oyetola an easy task. This we strongly condemned yesterday at the stakeholders meeting with the primary committee,” he added.

Meanwhile, Governor Oyetola has expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the ongoing primary election of the party.

The governor who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number, said: “Losing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.”

Oyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji yesterday.

He lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election had testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.

The governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.

Oyetola, however, appealed to the citizens across the state to maintain peace and decorum, adding that elections should not be a battle.

“By the grace of God I will emerge victorious.

Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in the state.

Oyetola was backed by the National Leader of the APC, Senator Bola Tinubu.

This is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party’s National Convention following the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

Oyetola also defeated his main challenger for the APC governorship ticket, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, at Ifofin Ward 8 of the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, in Ilesa East Local Government Area of the state.

The Osun State governor won in Aregbesola’s ward with 309 votes against 146 recorded for Adeoti, the aspirant anointed by Aregbesola.

The two aspirants, who contested with Oyetola were former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yusuff and a former Secretary to the State Government, Adeoti.

Announcing the result in the early hours of today, at the state’s APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Chairman of Osun APC Primary Election Committee and Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, said accredited voters were 247,207 while the total number of votes cast was 235,550.

Oyetola polled 222,169 votes to beat Aregbesola’s candidate, Adeoti, who scored 12,921, while Lasun came a distant third with 460 votes.

Before the primary election, Aregbesola had attacked Oyetola’s main backer and his estranged godfather, Tinubu, telling him that the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be administered on his brother, Oyetola.

However, Aregbesola was absent from the primary election and was said to have left Ilesa for Abuja yesterday morning for unspecified official duty.

While the minister has threatened to explore legal means to obtain justice, alleging that the results of the primary election were “farcically counted in favour of the governor,” Adeoti has vowed to seek Oyetola’s disqualification in court.

Reacting to the election in a statement issued in Osogbo, the state capital yesterday, Adeoti vowed to head to court to challenge what he referred to as “pyrrhic victory” won by Oyetola.

He accused the governor of rigging the election with the apparent backing of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.

Adeoti said the ugly development in Osun APC has sent a wrong signal as to whether the APC has a future in the state.

He also accused Oyetola of using intimidation and violence to ensure that the primary election was not free and fair.

”There was violence in Olorunda Local Government where the Ward 3 Chairman of the Rasaq Salinsile-led APC in Olorunda Local government, Mr. Sala Ademola and his secretary, Mr. Ajisefini were kidnapped. Our supporters were also disenfranchised in all the wards in Ife East by not being accredited and being intimidated with thugs wielding dangerous weapons.”

He also accused a top chieftain of APC of taking over the electioneering process in Ife and halting the accreditation process, sending out his supporter using thugs, while allowing and counting party members from the governor’s group.

The APC governorship aspirant also alleged that the Osun State government procured the services of armed policemen who aided the well-choreographed rigging of the election.

”There was also a massive influx of unregistered members of the party who voted with the connivance of the heavily-compromised National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, of which Oyetola is a member. Overall, there was a massive disenfranchisement of registered APC members in all my strongholds during the so-called primary election.”

He insisted that there was no way any primary election conducted in the state would be fair if Oyetola remains a member of the CECPC.

“Governor Oyetola’s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if allowed to pass us by.

“We are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the Chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.

“We, therefore, express absolute opposition to the outcome of the election because they were chosen by Governor Oyetola. There can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh,” Adeoti explained.

Adeoti argued that Oyetola’s participation in the election was a violation of the provision of Article 31(iii) of the APC Constitution (2014) as amended which says: “Any party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for office he or she is seeking to contest”.

He said the process had been orchestrated from the beginning to manipulate the outcome in favour of Oyetola, which was why the date of the primary was changed from March 5 to February 19.

“We have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022. It is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after a neutral leadership of the party would have emerged,” Adeoti alleged.

He however appealed to his supporters to be calm, vowing to seek a legal redress.

Also reacting in a statement by his media’s aide, Mr. Sola Fasure, the interior minister and Adeoti’s main backer alleged that the results of the governorship primary were “farcically counted in favour of the governor.”

He said: “We have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.

“We have been inundated with reports state-wide of how your names were expunged from the party’s voters’ register, which was not made available until this morning, contrary to the convention of making the list available to the candidates before the election.

“We have heard of how party registration cards were being hawked this morning to the supporters of the state governor.

“You are urged not to take laws into your hands. Please leave the rest to the Almighty God and let us explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice,” Aregbesola explained.

The Publicity Secretary of the Aregbesola-backed faction of the party in the state, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, in a statement issued, said: “We strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola”.

He alleged that there were no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.

The Chairman of the anti-Oyetola faction of the party in the state, Mr. Rasaq Salinsile, who is from Ward 04, Isale-Oba in Iwo Local Government Area also told THISDAY that the election was fraudulent.

Oyetola had expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the primary election.

The governor, who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number said, “losing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.”

Oyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji.

He lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election has testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.

The governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.

“I just want to appeal to all our people across the state to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her right to choose in determining who represents them at the party level and ultimately at the general election,” Oyetola added.

Also commenting on the election, the Chairman of Osun APC Governorship Primary and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRazak, also hailed the peaceful conduct of the exercise.

He applauded APC members for the huge turnout and their peaceful conduct.

He spoke with journalists after monitoring the election in Iragbiji, the hometown of Governor Oyetola.

He said: “If you open the pages of newspapers today, what was painted was a picture of the war in Osun. But the primaries election has been peaceful. I congratulate the people of Osun and all the aspirants. They have all done well.”

Buhari, APC Govs to Decide New Date for National Convention

Meanwhile, President Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party’s National Convention.

THISDAY gathered that this development followed the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the INEC.

A source close to the APC National Caretaker Committee told THISDAY at the weekend that the clash of the proposed convention with the national elections was brought to the attention of the party after it had written to notify INEC of its intention to hold the national convention.

“Elections are national issues that cut across political parties and therefore, it is not expected that party affairs should overshadow national elections. The stakeholders will meet and come up with a new date not beyond two to three weeks,” the source explained

On whether INEC has been notified, the source said that the electoral body would be notified after the proposed meeting between Buhari, the APC governors and the members of the caretaker committee.

"INEC Allays Fears on 2023 Elections, Says No Plan to Shift Polls","* Electoral Bill 2022 still inchoate, commission clarifies

Chuks Okocha in Abuja

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that the 2023 general election is not encumbered and will hold as planned, beginning with the presidential poll scheduled for February 18, 2023.

Responding to speculations that it might postpone the scheduled conduct of the 2023 general election if President Muhammadu Buhari signs the Electoral Bill after February 22, 2022, INEC’s National Commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman of Voter Education, Mr Festus Okoye told THISDAY that the commission was not in any form of dilemma relating to the exercise of its constitutional and legal powers.

Okoye stated that the commission was focused and working proactively to deliver on its mandate.

According to Section 28 (1) of the Electoral Bill 2022, INEC is required to issue a notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election.

The Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, had reportedly stated that in line with the Electoral Bill 2022, the deadline for the commission to issue the notice of election for the 2023 general election will be February 22, 2022, “the reasons being that the total number of days from February 22, 2022, to February 17, 2023, is 360 days.”

But Okoye told THISDAY that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which, according to him, is still inchoate.

According to him, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act.

He insisted that the electoral body was in synch with the constitutional provisions relating to the period for the holding of elections, adding that the provisions are sacrosanct and cast in stone.

“The commission is only permitted to orbit around the constitutional timelines in fixing the date for the holding of elections.

“The commission is a regulatory body guided by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as altered), the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and its Rules, Regulations and Guidelines.

“As of today, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act and the commission will continue to rely on its provisions for electoral continuity, pending any amendment to the said law.

“By the commission’s Regulations and Guidelines made pursuant to the powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the 2023 general election will hold on the 18th of February 2023,” Okoye explained.

He argued that the scheduled date is in consonance and in conformity with sections 132(1) and 178(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that gives the commission the exclusive right and power to appoint the date for the holding of Executive and Legislative Elections subject to the timelines and schedule circumscribed in Sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution.

“By the said sections, election to executive positions shall hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than 10th January 2023 and not later than May 10, 2023.

“By Section 30 of the existing and current Electoral Act, the commission shall give notice of the holding of the elections not later than 90 days to the said election and this remains the law and the commission is in good standing relating to its timelines and schedules,” Okoye added.

The INEC commissioner said that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which is still inchoate.

According to him, Section 28 of the said Bill requires the commission to give notice of election not later than 360 days to the said election, stressing that the said 360 days will elapse in the next few days.

He said that the commission was also aware that Section 58 of the Constitution gives the President 30 days to assent to the Bill or withhold his assent.

“The commission is aware that the Bill was transmitted to the President on January 31, 2022. The members of the National Assembly and the Executive are aware of these timelines in the Bill and the implications of the timelines if the Bill is assented to and these are issues that can be adjusted and streamlined.

“The commission desires an expeditious resolution of the issues surrounding the new electoral legal framework as there are creative and innovative issues and provisions in the Bill that will enhance and advance the electoral process and our democracy.

“The commission is focused and will continue with its preparations for the conduct of the 2023 general election. If there are challenges with timelines, the commission will meet, assess those challenges and remain within the constitutional and legal confines in sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution that requires that elections to executive positions to hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than January 10, 2023, and not later than May 10, 2023,” he explained.

Some civil society groups had declared February 22, 2022, National Day of Protest on the Electoral Bill

The groups said they were aware that the National Assembly transmitted the Bill to the President on January 2022.

They said that they were also aware the Bill allows for electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC’s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.

“The bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.

Accordingly, they said that they have resolved to declare Tuesday, February 22, 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill.

“We urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance”.

The CSOs that signed the statement include Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, and Civil Society, Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC).

Security Agencies Move against Importers of Off-spec Petrol,"*Begin interrogation of suspects

*Despite NNPC’s efforts, petrol queues persist in Abuja, Lagos

Kingsley Nwezeh and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

Security agencies have begun the probe of companies and individuals allegedly involved in the importation of toxic fuel into the country, THISDAY investigation has revealed.

This is coming as many filling stations were still under lock and key in Abuja and Lagos yesterday while the few that were selling petrol had long queues, despite the desperate efforts by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to bring the situation under control in the last one week.

The importation and circulation of adulterated petrol had resulted in damage to vehicle engines across many parts of the country.

It also affected the supply chain, causing long queues in Lagos and Abuja as filling stations shut down to clean up their tanks.

The situation is considered in security circles to have far-reaching economic and security implications.

THISDAY gathered that intelligence agencies invited companies involved in the scam, and they are presently undergoing interrogation.

Presidency sources confirmed to THISDAY that the masterminds of such a deadly importation would be held accountable as heads would roll over the development.

“Security agencies have commenced detailed investigation into circumstances that led to the importation of toxic fuel into the country.

“We are looking at who played what role and who did what. Many heads will roll. So far, all parties concerned are saying what they know. The government is not taking it lightly. Security agencies are on it,” a presidency source told THISDAY.

“It has security and economic implications. Investigations will involve all of them and heads will roll.

“At corporate and individual levels, they are cooperating and providing information about their involvement.

“It’s not out of place to investigate. Do you expect such a thing will happen without investigation when the president has ordered a probe?

“Critical players are being invited. The probe will be very comprehensive and heads will roll. Everyone, who played whatever role will be established”, another source explained.

The NMDPRA had alerted Nigerians over its discovery of petrol imported into the country that contained methanol above Nigeria’s specification.

The methanol-blended petrol, which is not made for Nigeria, made its way into the country.

The quantity was said to be within the range of 200 million litres.

The NNPC handles all the imports through its ‘Crude-for-fuel’ contracts, also known as Direct Sale, Direct Purchase (DSDP).

The agency conducted the business through a consortium of local and foreign oil firms.

Each consortium is said to have received about 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total of about 320,000bpd of Nigeria’s output.

The consortium, according to NNPC, includes MRS, Oando, EMADEB/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania and Duke Oil.

The NNPC, consequently, accused the four petroleum suppliers it engaged in the swap-crude-for-petrol of culpability.

Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, later promised that government would compensate those whose car engines were affected by the toxic fuel.

But the contractors denied responsibility.

Despite NNPC’s Efforts, Petrol Queues Persist in Abuja, Lagos

Meanwhile, many filling stations were still under lock and key in Abuja and Lagos yesterday while the few that were selling petrol had long queues, despite the desperate efforts by the NNPC Limited to bring the situation under control in the last one week.

Majority of the dispensing centres visited by THISDAY in the two major cities did not have the product while those that were selling, including the NNPC, had long queues of buyers lined up.

Recently, the national oil company had taken a multi-pronged approach to halt the pains encountered by Nigerians as a result of the nationwide fuel shortage.

Among other measures, the NNPC had announced that between last week and the end of February, it was expecting at least 2.3 billion litres of the product to berth in Nigeria.

Although in the last few days, there had been considerable movement of trucks within Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), many of the streets had remained clogged by traffic due to the prevailing condition.

In addition, the NNPC stated that in collaboration with other stakeholders, it was embarking on a 24-hour service, noting that Nigerians could buy the product round the clock in filling stations.

Besides, it announced that at the moment, the nation has over one billion litres of petrol in stock, adding that all the fuel in circulation in the country is now certified safe after successfully withdrawing the bad fuel that disrupted supply.

But THISDAY observed that many filling stations were still not selling the product yesterday, despite all the measures put in place by the sole supplier.

In both Lagos Island and the mainland, long queues of vehicles were seen at the few filling stations selling petrol.

It was also a brisk business for the ‘black market’ operators, who were selling one litre of the product for N300 – N500, depending on the location.

At Oando in Mabushi, near the Ministry of Works in Abuja, the gates were still locked while there was no petrol at Total filling station on Sultan Abubakar way, Zone 1, although cars were in the queues.

There were also no sales at the Enyo filling station, near GSM Village, and the Total Filling Station on Herbert Macaulay Street.

But at the NNPC mega station on Olusegun Obasanjo Way, sales were ongoing, but a long queue of almost one kilometre was observed.

However, unlike in the past two weeks when motorists blocked the road, some level of sanity has returned.

In the outskirts of Abuja, motorists and commuters were still largely stranded due to their inability to access petrol to get to their destinations.

Many commuters were forced to abandon their vehicles on the road in frustration.

At the Karshi, Orozo, Jikwoyi axis of the FCT, motorists spent hours in queues waiting to be served in the few filling stations that had the product to sell.

Long queues were also on both sides of the Karshi-Nyanya expressway, causing gridlock that stretched down the roads for kilometres.

"CBN Has Enough FX to Meet Market Demand, Report Reveals","* Says inflows from Eurobond, SDR will boost forex supply

Festus Akanbi

Amid a spate of measures being put in place by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to reduce pressure on the nation’s foreign exchange market, analysts from Coudros Securities have expressed confidence in the capacity of the apex bank to meet the forex demand with inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR).

In its Weekly economic and market update titled: ‘Overview of markets in the week ended 18 February 2022,’ the securities company also stressed the need to attract more foreign portfolio investments to sustain liquidity inflow to the economy.

The analysts argued that the current low level of crude oil production has weakened foreign reserves accretion, a development which they said necessitated the implementation of policies that would encourage the inflow of foreign portfolio investments.

According to the report, “the CBN has enough supply to support the FX market over the short term, given inflows from the recently issued Eurobond and the IMF’s SDR.

“However, foreign inflows are paramount for sustained FX liquidity over the medium term, in line with our expectation that accretion to the reserves will be weak given that crude oil production levels remain pretty low.”

The report called for additional measures to attract FPIs, insisting that: “Thus, FPIs which have historically supported supply levels in the IEW (53.8% of FX inflows to the IEW in 2019FY) will be needed to sustain FX liquidity levels. Hence, we think (1) further adjustments in the NGN/USD peg closer to its fair value and (2) flexibility in the exchange rate would significantly attract foreign inflows back to the market.”

As of last week, Nigeria’s foreign reserves was $40.7 billion almost at the $42 billion thresholds set by the apex bank for mid-2022.

Last year, Nigeria was able to raise $4 billion through Eurobonds, which financial analysts described as a reflection of investors’ confidence in the economy.

The Debt Management Office (DMO) had in a statement explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.

The Eurobonds were issued in three tranches, details, namely seven years –,$1.25 billion at 6.125 per cent per annum; 12 years -$1.5 billion at 7.375 per cent per annum as well as 30 years -$1.25 billion at 8.25 per annum.

Also last year, the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had approved the allocation of $3.35 billion to Nigeria as part of a historic general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the International Multilateral Institution.

SDRs are international reserve assets created by the IMF and allocated to members to supplement existing official reserves. Holdings of SDRs by an IMF member are recorded as an asset, while the allocation of SDRs is recorded as the incurrence of liability of the member receiving them.

Earlier this year, the CBN announced a new scheme to improve dollar supply, known as Bankers’ Committee “RT200 FX Programme”, which stands for the “Race to $200 billion in FX Repatriation.”

According to the Governor of CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, “the RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us to attain our lofty yet attainable goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.”

"Unlawful dismissal: Navy yet to 'fully reinstate' Labinjo, wife -- despite supreme court verdict","Years after getting court judgments ordering their reinstatement into the naval service, Dada Labinjo and his wife, Sherifat Ibe-Lamberts (also known as Bola Labinjo), say the Nigerian Navy is yet to comply.

This is in spite of letters sent to the office of the vice-president and the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), seeking the intervention of the federal government.

HOW IT STARTED: IBE-LAMBERTS’ STORY

Advertisement

In 1997, Ibe-Lamberts, who was a lieutenant-commander in the navy at the time, appeared before a court martial on a five-count charge, including an allegation of unauthorised visit to a foreign mission.

On July 12, 1997, Sherifat was convicted and sentenced to two years of loss in seniority by the court martial. When the naval board ratified the conviction, the sanction was upgraded to compulsory retirement as contained in a letter dated February 2, 1998.

In the letter seen by TheCable, the naval board said her service was “no longer required,” adding that the retirement will take effect from January 21, 1998.

Advertisement

Dissatisfied with the conditions for retirement, Ibe-Lamberts filed a suit against the navy and the case went up to the appeal court. In December 2005, the appeal court ruled in her favour and set aside the ruling of the court martial.

Subsequently, the navy proceeded to the supreme court to request that the lower court’s judgment be set aside. In September 2007, the supreme court dismissed the navy’s appeal for lack of merit.

LABINJO’S EXPERIENCE

Advertisement

Labinjo, who was then a navy captain, was accused of offences ranging from disobedience of superior order to alleged involvement in oil bunkering.

In 2001, a court martial convicted Labinjo and sentenced him to six years imprisonment with a recommendation of dismissal. He subsequently approached the federal high court in Lagos to seek a dismissal of the ruling of the court martial on the basis that it was a breach of his fundamental human rights.

On May 3, 2004, the federal high court in Lagos declared the trial null and void for gross irregularities and breach of the fundamental human rights of the respondent. The court also ruled that Labinjo should be restored to his pre-trial position in the navy with payment of arrears of salaries and allowances.

However, the navy, through its counsel, filed a notice in the appeal court on May 31, 2004, and followed it up with an application filed on August 19, 2004.

In May 2008, the court dismissed the appeal filed by the navy for want of diligent prosecution, following the refusal of the navy to file “more legible copies” of the exhibits of the case presented to the lower court.

The navy, thereafter, approached the supreme court on the grounds that the appeal court was wrong to dismiss its suit without the opportunity to put forward its case, which the navy said violated its right to a fair hearing.

In June 2012, the supreme court ruled that the appeal was without merit and affirmed the decision of the lower court.

REINSTATED — BUT ‘WITHOUT PROMOTIONS AND ENTITLEMENTS’

After a series of letters written by the couple’s counsel to the ministry of justice, in 2015, Taiwo Abidogun, the solicitor-general at the time, wrote to the defence minister to ask for the navy to comply with the court rulings.

“This matter has a chequered history, having traversed the hierarchy of courts to the Supreme Court and back. In the circumstances, it is advised that it is in the best interest of the Nigerian Navy to comply with the judgment at the earliest possible time as it is worrisome for agencies of government to be seen in defiance of valid and subsisting court judgments,” the letter reads.

“However, in complying with this judgment, the Nigerian Navy may take steps to negotiate the amount to be paid to the claimant. This ministry volunteers its services to act as mediator to facilitate a negotiation between the parties.”

On April 11, 2017, the couple received letters notifying them of their reinstatement into the force.

Before his dismissal, Labinjo, who joined the navy in 1975, held the rank of captain, while Ibe-Lamberts joined the navy in 1984 and held the rank of lieutenant-commander at the time of her dismissal. The letters of reinstatement, however, did not state anything on benefits or promotions.

Again, the couple wrote to the naval authorities requesting that all previous promotions and entitlements be effected in line with the time that had passed. In 2018, the navy, in its response to the letters on payments of corresponding benefits, insisted that the court “only ordered the reinstatement of the senior officers to the Nigerian Navy and nothing more”.

DETENTION AMID LEGAL DISPUTE

While the couple awaited the navy’s position on full reinstatement, on September 13, 2018, Labinjo was arrested and detained in an underground cell. The next day, his wife was arrested. They were accused of conspiracy and unlawful dealing in petroleum products.

The couple spent months in detention amid calls for their release, including interventions by Femi Falana, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), as well as a court order directing that they be freed.

Eventually, Ibe-Lamberts was released in August 2019, while Labinjo was released on December 3, 2019. They were then handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for prosecution over alleged offences bordering on oil bunkering. The next court appearance on the EFCC case is scheduled for March 2022.

APPEAL TO AGF, OSINBAJO

While the couple awaits the navy on full reinstatement, several letters have been written to the office of the AGF and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, seeking their intervention on the matter.

In July 2021, the couple, through their counsel, wrote yet another letter to the AGF.

“The implication of the judgments in respect of the 2 officers is that the courts have granted accrued promotions to the officers as follows: ‘Capt DO Labinjo: Commodore with effect from July 2003; Rear Admiral with effect from July 2006; Vice Admiral with effect from March 2011; Admiral with effect from April 2013; and Lieutenant Commander SA Ibe-Lamberts: Commander with effect from 27 August, 1998; Captain with effect from 27 August, 2004; Commodore with effect from 27 August, 2009; Rear Admiral with effect from 27 August. 2013,” the letter to Malami reads.

“It is on this note, sir, that we humbly request the honourable minister and attorney-general of the federation to use his esteemed office to cause the Nigerian Navy to restore our clients to where they ought to be, by granting their accrued promotions to rear admiral and admiral, respectively, and immediate retirement from the service of the Nigerian Navy thereafter and the payment of all their accrued emoluments, entitlements, gratuity and pensions respectively.”

In October 2021, the AGF forwarded the petition to the navy, asking for comments to enable him to take an “informed decision” on the matter.

“I am directed to forward the above mentioned petition dated 12th July, 2021 with reference No: MLC/NN/07-21/01 addressed to the honourable attorney general of the federation and minister of justice by Marina Law Chambers on behalf of the client. A copy is herewith attached for ease of reference,” the AGF’s letter to the navy reads.

“I am further directed to request for your comments to enable the honourable attorney general of the federation take an informed decision on the matter.”

‘WE WANT FULL REINSTATEMENT’

Speaking with TheCable on behalf of the couple, Labinjo said after full reinstatement and receiving payment for all previous entitlements, they will willingly resign from service, since they have exceeded the required years of service.

“We are asking for three things. One, they (referring to navy) should re-employ us in line with the court order. The meaning of reinstatement is to re-employ the person,” he said.

“Two, restore the person. If you reinstate somebody and you did not restore, you haven’t done anything. Would you have done justice? To restore us, they need to get us all the promotions accrued to us during the litigation period.

“That same day, accept our resignation from the navy. My 35 years’ service in the navy should have ended in 2010, while that of my wife is 2019. All our mates have retired.

“None of us is technically employable in the navy but they should do documentation, re-employ us, at the same time, accept our resignation and pay us all our previous entitlements and emoluments accrued during the litigation period.”

NAVY YET TO RESPOND

When TheCable reached out to Suleman Dahun, navy spokesperson, he asked that a letter be sent to the navy seeking an explanation on the Labinjo and Ibe-Lamberts case.

The letter was sent via the email address provided by the navy spokesperson but no response had been received at the time of this report.","Years after getting court judgments ordering their reinstatement into the naval service, Dada Labinjo and his wife, Sherifat Ibe-Lamberts (also known as Bola Labinjo), say the Nigerian Navy is yet to comply.

"Oyo Monarch, Alaafin, May Broker Peace Between Tinubu, Aregbesola","The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi, is expected to wade into the face-off between the national leader and presidential hopeful of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his estranged godson and Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.

A source told journalists in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, that the rift between the duo had created a political tension in the South-West, hence the planned intervention of the foremost Oyo monarch.

Tinubu was scheduled to pay a visit to the palace of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi this Sunday, as part of the continuation of his engagement with traditional rulers across the country’s six geo-political zones in respect of his 2023 presidential ambition.

LEADERSHIP, however, gathered that Tinubu’s planned visit to the Alaafin is not connected to the feud between him and Aregbesola even though the traditional ruler will be willing to broker peace between the duo at the appropriate time.

In an exclusive chat with LEADERSHIP, a member of the House of Representatives and a son of Alaafin, Prince Akeem Adeyemi, said Tinubu’s visit to the Oyo Palace has nothing to do with any peace meeting.

“Asiwaju is coming today to visit Alaafin as part of his consultations with monarchs, it has nothing to do with any rift settlement and the Alaafin did not summon anybody to the palace for any peace meeting.

“However, if the need be, the Alaafin will wade into the rift in the interest of peace and development of Yoruba land. But that is not for today (Sunday), it’s a matter for another day,” Prince Adeyemi said.

It would be recalled that Aregbesola’s anointed aspirant, Moshood Adeoti lost to the incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola in the Saturday’s APC primary election.

"Niger Delta: Stakeholders Task State Govts, Others On Capacity-building","As part of conscious efforts to change the negative narrative about Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta, young professionals have tasked governors of the region to invest more in human capacity development and create purposeful opportunities for young people, especially entrepreneurs and start-ups, to thrive.

The position was canvassed by stakeholders, who gathered at the 2nd Niger Delta MSME Summit held on Saturday, February 19, in Asaba, Delta State, with the theme: ‘Stimulating MSMEs Growth Towards Post Covid-19 Recovery’.

ADVERTISEMENT

They advocated that governments of the Niger State States must move away from the political tradition of just signing and awarding contracts, to strategic empowerment and support for innovative creative minds in the region.

The event jointly organised by the Niger Delta Young Professionals (NDYP) and the Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), was sequel to the pioneer edition held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital in February, 2021.

ADVERTISEMENT

Delivering his opening remarks at the event, the chairman of the NYPF and convener of the summit, Mr Moses Siloko Siasia, explained that the event was aimed at creating a platform for young business owners to interface with agencies of government and stakeholders on how best to access information, credit, support facilities, as well as build strategic relationships and networks.

The summit according to him, will also go a long way in changing the wrong perceptions of militancy and other forms of youth restiveness that many associate the region’s youthful population with.

“Today, if you go to Google and search for Niger Delta youths, what you will see are youths with guns inside speed boat and all those bad stuffs. We must change that, we must change that negative narrative, this is not the narrative of the Niger Delta people, our leaders must help us to change that narrative because the time for politics is over in today’s world.

“We are in the 4th industrial revolution where people are using digital intelligence and technology to change the worlds economies. We must conform to modern reality and that is why we are doing this MSME Summit to help our young people, so that they can build the capacity to create sustainable livelihood for themselves, their family and the society,” he said.

Siasia further called on successful businessmen from the region the CEO of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu; group managing director of Access Bank, Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe; chairman of Zenith Bank, Jim Ovia; founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, Atedo Peterside, CON, and many others, to deliberately leave footprints from their region, stressing that charity begins at home.

Lending his voice to Siasia’s call, CEO of BlueCamel Energy Limited, Mr Suleiman Yusuf, lamented that successful people were not enjoying the full proceeds of their wealth, owing to youth restiveness and numerous forms of insecurity arising from the absence of platforms to productively engage them.

“Success has found its way to the long list of problems we have in Nigeria because successful people in private industry or government cannot freely enjoy their wealth. They live in highly fortified houses, travel in armoured vehicles and cannot move around without armed personnel.

“This problem exists because there are no jobs and support mechanisms to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship among youths. Unless jobs and created and young people are engaged, there will be no peace in the Nger Delta and other regions. Government and well to do individuals must begin to allocate resources towards human capacity development, especially for young people who are leaders of tomorrow,” he submitted.

On his part, the executive secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote, represented by the Board’s General Manager, Capacity Development, Dr. Ama Ikuru, acknowledged that Nigeria ranks poorly in terms of human capacity development index.

According to him: “The discussions we are having at this Summit can change the narrative. We want to see the emergence of young entrepreneurs and support them to succeed. We want to put tools in their toolboxes to ensure the security and economic prosperity of our nation.”

While noting that the NCDMB has interventions in place to help promote entrepreneurship such as the $350m Nigerian Content Intervention Fund to help businesses in the oil and gas industry access finance, Wabote added that the Board will continue to associate and support anything that is in the best interest of the good people of Nigeria, especially its vibrant youth population.

Saturday’s event saw the convergence of over 1,000 participants from the nine Niger Delta States, who gathered to build on the success of the innaugural summit held last year, where over 300 Niger Deltans benefited from the NIRSAL intervention loans for small business owners in the area of agriculture.

In his closing remarks, Siasia appreciated the stakeholders that supported the summit, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), led by its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who is from Delta State; CEO, Heritage Bank Plc, Dr Ifie Sekibo; NCDMB boss, Engr Simbi Wabote, and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) led by Mr Effiong Akwa.

High point of the event was the sharing of heart-touching testimonies by some successful business owners in the Niger Delta.

They appreciated stakeholders for the platform, stressing that they have grown successful businesses with youths under their employment, whereby creating jobs.

It is noteworthy that the 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit is the 48th event to be organised by the NYPF.

The NYPF has in the space of a few years, held value-adding events in Nigeria and abroad. In one of its strategic events held at New York in 2016, the then United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, sent a special goodwill message to the NYPF, acknowledging its drive for human capacity development.

Aliyu stressed that in the course of monitoring the voting process it was observed that it was slow at several polling units owing to malfunctioning or faulty BVAS machines.

FBI Vs Hushpuppi: FG Told To Extradite Abba Kyari To US After NDLEA Arrest,"FBI Vs Hushpuppi: FG Told To Extradite Abba Kyari To US After NDLEA Arrest

Ohanaeze Ndigbo has requested the Federal Government of Nigeria to enable DCP Abba Kyari, the suspended head of the IRT, to be extradited to the United States to face the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) claims in the hushpuppi affair.

Ramon Abbas, a.k.a. Hushpuppi, is being investigated by the FBI on allegations of Business Email Compromise (BEC) and money laundering.

The FBI requested that Nigeria send up Kyari in August 2021.

The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arrested Kyari and others on Monday for alleged ties to an international narcotics syndicate.

The Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the policemen charged with links to an international narcotics syndicate on Thursday.

“DCP Abba Kyari, who was under suspension previous to this allegation, shall stay on suspension,” the PSC wrote.

The statements Kyari made to undercover officers probing the cocaine seizure were previously published by the anti-narcotics agency.

Ohanaeze, in a statement given to DAILY POST on Sunday by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, reacted to the situation by advising the FG not to allow Kyari to remain in Nigeria following his recent arrest by the NDLEA.

The statement read, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has warned that the suspended head of IRT, DCP Abba Kyari should never be allowed to remain in Nigeria with his recent arrest by NDLEA, with overwhelming evidence of complicity in drugs-related cases.

“Rather than keeping him here in Nigeria, he should be extradited to the United States to face the allegations from FBI over the hushpuppi scandal and criminal activities.

“DCP Abba Kyari should be allowed to face his crimes in the United States. This will serve as a deterrent to others; this will bolster the fight against corruption.

“The activities of suspended DCP Abba Kyari in Imo State and the Southeast was dubious and controversial based on the fact that those who were allegedly killed by Abba Kyari, should have been allowed to face the consequences of their actions in any competent court of jurisdiction.

“The overflow of corpses of Igbo youths at the FMC Owerri and other places in the South-East was the alleged handiwork of IRT team, led by Kyari; no wonder that nemesis caught up with Abba Kyari so quickly. His appetite for the looting of his suspect’s belongings and cash is second to none; that’s why he was obsessed with covetousness and greed to the point of being unaware of the video recording that was used by the NDLEA against him.”

“There is no evidence that IPOB was after Abba Kyari. Nemesis is hunting Kyari. Nigerians want a thorough investigation of the alleged criminal indictment of Abba Kyari and subsequent extradition to the United States.”","FBI Vs Hushpuppi: FG Told To Extradite Abba Kyari To US After NDLEA ArrestOhanaeze Ndigbo has requested the Federal Government of Nigeria to enable DCP Abba Kyari, the suspended head of the IRT, to be extradited to the United States to face the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) claims in the hushpuppi affair.

JUST IN: Aregbesola Laments As Oyetola Wins Osun APC Guber Ticket,"JUST IN: Aregbesola Laments As Oyetola Wins Osun APC Guber Ticket

Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola has been proclaimed the winner of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary poll.

The election is billed to hold on July 16.

The governor, who is seeking a second term in office, defeated Moshood Adeoti and Yusuf Lasun to win the governorship primary on Saturday.

The results were announced around 3am on Sunday by AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, Kwara state governor and chairman of the Osun APC primary election committee.

“I hereby certified that Gboyega Oyetola, having secured the number of highest votes cast at the primary election and having secured all guidelines contained, is hereby declared winner,” he said.

Oyetola was adjudged to have polled 222,169 votes while his closest challenger, Moshood Adeoti, secured 12,921 votes and Yusuf Lasun had just 460.

According to the primary election committee, the total number of accredited voters stood at 247,207 while 235,550 votes were cast.

The primary election was marred by allegations of widespread irregularities while several party members also claimed that their names were expunged from the voters’ register.

Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, had described the exercise as a “sham of an election”.

The minister had asked his supporters not to take laws into their hands, saying his camp will “explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice”.

The APC in Osun has two factions: one is loyal to Aregbesola while the other pledges allegiance to Oyetola, the incumbent governor of the state.

The build-up to Saturday’s primary highlighted a division within the ruling party in the state following a disagreement between incumbent Governor Oyetola and his predecessor, Mr Rauf Aregbesola.

This prompted the former governor to seek to unseat Oyetola whom he supported to succeed him in September 2018. Aregbesola, who serves as the Minister of Interior in President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet, has now declared his support for Adeoti, as his anointed candidate for the forthcoming election.

The primary also came with drama and controversy as the members of the camps of the minister and governor traded blames and accusations, including accusing each side of instigating violence. Both sides denied doing anything to disturb the peace or to illegally influence the outcome of the poll.

Notwithstanding the disagreement, the minister asked members of the party in the state loyal to him to conduct themselves in a peaceful matter throughout the exercise.

While the primary was in progress, the faction of the APC loyal to the minister condemned it.

In a statement by its spokesman, Abiodun Agboola, the faction alleged widespread irregularities in the exercise conducted by the Osun APC Primary Election Committee led by Governor Abdulrasaq of Kwara State.

“The Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee should know that the primary lacks credibility and fairness,” it said.

“It is necessary and important to inform the general public and Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq led Osun APC Primary Election Committee of the ongoing irregularities in the conduct of the primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State of Osun.

“We strongly condemn the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Verified information from the agents of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there are no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.”

Governor Oyetola, on his part commended the process, and described as free and fair after voting.","﻿Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has won the governorship primary of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state.

Judiciary Open To Initiatives For Capacity Building For Judicial Officers – CJN,"The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Hon. Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, has said the Judiciary is open to initiatives aimed at improving and strengthening the capacity of judicial officers in the handling of cases on emerging crime trends in the country.

The CJN made the request at the weekend while playing host to a visiting delegation of US officials led by the Ambassador to Nigeria, Ms. Mary Beth Leonard.

Some of those emerging crimes, the CJN said include cybercrime, cross-jurisdictional infringement of Intellectual property rights, and cases related to cybersecurity and espionage.

The CJN added that judges in the country require training on block technology and online dispute resolution as it affects e-commerce which is becoming a challenge due to inadequate awareness of technology and technical abilities and capacity.

He requested for workshops that would border on Copyright Law in the new digital environment for judicial officers and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards relating to intellectual property disputes.

‘’Capacity building for our judicial officers is our priority, while the development of the capacity of our Research Assistants and other staff of the National Judicial Institute, who are fully involved in these training programmes, is also very important.

‘’Your Excellency, without taking the cat out of your bag, I want to assure you that our doors are always wide open to welcome proposals that will be beneficial to the development of the Rule of Law and the overall growth of the Judiciary of this country.

“The National Judicial Institute will never relent in its efforts to serve as the principal focal point of judicial activities on issues relating to the promotion of efficiency, uniformity and improvement in the quality of judicial services in our courts’’, the CJN stated.

The U.S. Ambassador said, “this courtesy call is an opportunity to encourage the Nigerian Judiciary to continue collaborating with the United States Mission, including in raising the profile of intellectual property (IP) protection which is essential for Nigeria’s development and international partnerships’’.

She said the US is looking to increase its capacity-building engagement on cybersecurity issues, adding that her country is interested in continued collaboration with the Judiciary and courts through its International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office (INL) and Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT).

Ms. Leonard hinted that the U.S. was exploring how best to support Nigeria’s judicial processes during the 2023 elections.

The justices of the Supreme Court, who accompanied the CJN to receive the U.S. delegation are Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, Inyang John Okoro, Amina Adamu Augie, Ejembi Eko, Uwani Musa Abba-Aji, M.L.Garba, Helen Ogunwumiju, Abdu Aboki, Adamu Jauro and Emmanuel A. Agim.

Putin Oversees Nuclear Drills as US Insists Russia Plans to Invade Ukraine,"Russia’s strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Washington accused Russian troops massed near Ukraine’s border of advancing and being “poised to strike”.

With Western fears of war rising, the White House said U.S President Joe Biden’s national security team told him they still believed Russia could launch an attack in Ukraine “at any time” and he planned to convene his top advisers on Sunday to discuss the crisis.

Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations said they had seen no evidence Russia is reducing its military activity in the area and remained “gravely concerned” about the situation.

After Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over new shelling near the border, France and Germany urged all or some of their citizens in Ukraine to leave. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to “uncoil and move closer” to the border.

“We hope he (Putin) steps back from the brink of conflict,” Austin told a news conference in Lithuania, saying an invasion of Ukraine was not inevitable.

Russia ordered the military build-up while demanding NATO prevent Ukraine from ever joining the alliance but says Western warnings that it is planning to invade Ukraine are hysterical and dangerous. Moscow says it is pulling back, but Washington and allies say the build-up is mounting.

Washington and NATO say Moscow’s main demands are non-starters, but in Ukraine fears are growing over Putin’s plans.

Venting his frustration at a security conference in Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the global security architecture was “almost broken”. He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Turkey to meet to draw up new security guarantees for his country.

“The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work,” Zelenskiy said. “They do not keep up with new threats … This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine.”

World Bank President David Malpass told Zelenskiy on Saturday the bank was readying funding to Ukraine of up to $350 million.

The Kremlin said Russia successfully test-launched hypersonic and cruise missiles at sea during the nuclear forces drills. Putin observed the exercises on screens with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko from a “situation centre”.

In his most pointed prediction so far, Biden said on Friday he was convinced that Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine in the coming days, and Austin said on Saturday the nuclear forces exercises were stoking concerns around the world.

“President Biden continues to monitor the evolving situation in Ukraine, and is being updated regularly about events on the ground by his national security team,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. “They reaffirmed that Russia could launch an attack against Ukraine at any time.”

G7 foreign ministers called on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy. “As a first step, we expect Russia to implement the announced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine’s borders. We have seen no evidence of this reduction,” they said in a statement.

Zelenskiy said he had an “urgent” phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed possible ways of immediate de-escalation and political-diplomatic settlement. Macron is due to speak with Putin on Sunday.

The nuclear drills follow manoeuvres by Russia’s armed forces in the past four months that have included a build-up of troops — estimated by the West to number 150,000 or more — to the north, east and south of Ukraine.

New helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and support equipment have been moved to sites in Russia near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies, which tracks developments with satellite imagery.

Moscow-based analysts said Saturday’s exercises were aimed at sending a message to take Russia’s demands seriously.

“Ignoring Russia’s legitimate rights in this area adversely affects the stability not only on the European continent, but also in the world,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by his ministry as telling his French counterpart by phone.

A NATO official said the alliance relocated staff from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv and to Brussels for safety reasons. The United States and other countries have moved diplomats to Lviv.

SHELLING ALLEGATIONS

Russian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east.

Separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have declared a full military mobilisation after ordering women and children to evacuate to Russia, citing the threat of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces, which Kyiv denied.

Kyiv and Western leaders say the mobilisation, evacuation and increased shelling are part of a Russian plan to create a pretext for an invasion.

Russia’s FSB security service said two shells landed on Russian territory near the border, Russia’s Tass news agency reported.

Ukraine’s military accused Russia of faking pictures of shells to make out they were Ukrainian, and said mercenaries had arrived in separatist-held eastern Ukraine to stage provocations in collaboration with Russian special forces.

Ukraine’s foreign minister demanded an independent international investigation of the alleged incidents and the military said two soldiers had been killed in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine.

The two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said. And almost 2,000 ceasefire violations were registered in the area by OSCE monitors on Saturday, a diplomatic source told Reuters. read more

Multiple explosions were heard overnight into Sunday in the centre of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, a Reuters reporter said. The blasts’ origin was not clear. There was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or Kyiv.

“It’s really scary. I’ve taken everything I could carry,” said Tatyana, 30, who was boarding a bus with her 4-year-old daughter.

Russian news agencies said 10,000 evacuees had arrived in Russia. Separatist leaders say they aim to evacuate 700,000 people.","U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to “uncoil and move closer” to the border.

"Russia Planning Biggest War in Europe Since 1945, UK PM Johnson Says","Evidence suggests Russia is planning “the biggest war in Europe since 1945”, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

He told the BBC’s Sophie Raworth in an interview: “All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun.”

Intelligence suggests Russia intends to launch an invasion that will encircle Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Mr Johnson said.

“People need to understand the sheer cost in human life that could entail,” he said

The prime minister was speaking from Munich, where world leaders are meeting for an annual security conference.

The latest estimates by the US government suggests that between 169,000 and 190,000 Russian troops are now stationed along Ukraine’s border, both in Russia and neighbouring Belarus – but this figure also includes rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Mr Johnson also indicated that the UK would bring in even more far-reaching sanctions against Russia than have been suggested before.

He said the UK and the US would stop Russian companies “trading in pounds and dollars” – a move that he said would “hit very very hard” with its impact.

Previous sanctions suggested by ministers include broadening the range of Russian people and businesses the UK could target.

Western officials have warned in recent weeks that Russia could be preparing to invade at any time, but Russia has denied the claims, saying troops are conducting military exercises in the region.Asked whether a Russian invasion is still thought to be imminent, Mr Johnson said: “I’m afraid that that is what the evidence points to, there’s no burnishing it.”The fact is that all the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun.”The prime minister said US President Joe Biden had told Western leaders intelligence suggested Russian forces were not just planning on entering Ukraine from the east, via Donbas, but down from Belarus and the area surrounding Kyiv.”I’m afraid to say that the plan we are seeing is for something that could be really the biggest war in Europe since 1945 just in terms of sheer scale,” the prime minister said.People needed to not only consider the potential loss of life of Ukrainians, but also of “young Russians”, he added.Mr Johnson was speaking after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and telling world leaders in a speech that any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would “echo around the world”.","Evidence suggests Russia is planning “the biggest war in Europe since 1945”, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy Calls on Putin to Meet as Tensions Soar,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, facing a sharp spike in violence in and around territory held by Russia-backed rebels and increasingly dire warnings that Russia plans to invade, on Saturday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet him and seek resolution to the crisis.

“I don’t know what the president of the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting,” Zelenskyy said at the Munich Security Conference, where he also met with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. Zelenskyy said Russia could pick the location for the talks.

“Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

There was no immediate response from the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy spoke hours after separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine ordered a full military mobilization on Saturday while Western leaders made increasingly dire warnings that a Russian invasion of its neighbor appeared imminent.

In new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa canceled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion.NATO’s liaison office in Kyiv said it was relocating staff to Brussels and to the western Ukraine city of Lviv. Meanwhile, top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the nearly eight-year separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

The officials fled to a bomb shelter before hustling from the area, according to an Associated Press journalist who was on the tour.Violence in eastern Ukraine has spiked in recent days as Ukraine and the two regions held by the rebels each accused the other of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed that claim as “a fake statement.”Sporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed rebels, but the recent shelling and bombing spike could set off a full-scale war.The United States and many European countries have alleged for months that Russia, which has moved about 150,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, is trying to create pretexts to invade.“They are uncoiling and are now poised to strike,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday during a visit to Lithuania.Harris opened her meeting with Zelenskyy by saying the world was at “a decisive moment in history.”Earlier Saturday, Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, cited an “immediate threat of aggression” from Ukrainian forces in his announcement. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force.“I appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,” Pushilin said. ”Together we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need.”A similar statement followed from his counterpart in the Luhansk region. On Friday, the rebels began evacuating civilians to Russia with an announcement that appeared to be part of their and Moscow’s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the evacuation orders could be a tactic to provide the spark for a broader attack.“To say it very clearly, Ukraine did not give any grounds for the evacuation that was ordered yesterday,” she said. “Those are the facts on the ground. We must not allow supposed reasons for war to be constructed out of hot air.”U.S. President Joe Biden said late Friday that based on the latest American intelligence, he was now “convinced” that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital.“As of this moment, I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.”Biden was briefed on Harris’ meetings in Munich and has been getting regular updates on the Ukraine situation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Saturday. Biden will discuss Ukraine during a meeting with his National Security Council on Sunday, she said.Meanwhile, Russia conducted massive nuclear drills on Saturday. The Kremlin said Putin, who pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats, was watching the drills together with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko from the situation room.Notably, the planned exercise involves the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula after seizing it from Ukraine in 2014. .Underscoring the West’s concerns of an imminent invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border.The shift has been underway for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.Lines of communication between Moscow and the West remain open: the American and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron scheduled a phone call with Putin on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. Violations of a 2015 ceasefire agreement, including shelling and shooting along the line of contact, have been common.A car bomb exploded in the center of the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk on Friday. Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. No injuries were reported in the incidents.Ukraine’s military said two of its soldiers died in firing from the rebel side on Saturday.By Saturday morning, the separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas, said that thousands of residents of the rebel-controlled areas had been evacuated to Russia.Russia has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action.Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk rebel government, alleged in a video statement that Ukraine was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, the AP confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s effort to come up with an invasion pretext could include staged, prerecorded videos.Authorities in Russia’s Rostov region, which borders eastern Ukraine, declared a state of emergency because of the influx of evacuees. Media reports on Saturday described chaos at some of the camps assigned to accommodate the people from eastern Ukraine. The reports said there were long lines of buses and hundreds of people waiting in the cold for hours on end to be housed without access to food or bathroom facilities.Putin ordered the Russian government to offer 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, an amount equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in eastern Ukraine.___","Zelenskyy said Russia could pick the location for the talks.

"FG Willing to Partner Investors on Power Supply, Says Minister","The Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, has disclosed that the federal government was willing to partner investors in the power sector to improve electricity supply in the country

This came as the Managing Director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET), Mr. Nnaemeka Ewelukwa, said the government was putting reforms in place to ensure stable power supply in the country.

Aliyu, in a statement signed by the Information Officer in the Press and Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of Power, Mr. Mathew Osumanyi Dan’asabe, made this known while receiving the Ambassador of Turkey to Nigeria, Mr. Hidayet Bayratar, in company of two other delegates in his office in Abuja.

He said President Muhammadu Buhari’s desire towards the power sector was to ensure that the electricity supply industry is owned by both government and the private sectors.

According to him, Nigeria and Turkey’s relationship is a long-standing one which culminated in the signing of an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Turkey and Nigeria in October 2021 for mutual benefits.

Aliyu told the ambassador that various interventions were being put into the power sector of the country.

He described the distribution aspect of the power sector in the country as an area worth investing.

The minister urged Turkey and the rest of the world to partner Nigeria and share experience in the fields of energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

In his response, the ambassador said their visit was a follow-up to the MoU signed in 2021.

In related development, the Managing Director of NBET, Ewelukwa, has said that the federal government is putting reforms in place to ensure stable power supply in the country.

Ewelukwa made this known at a capacity-building workshop for members of the Power Correspondents Association of Nigeria (PCAN) and Civil Society Organisations in Lagos.

The workshop, with the theme: ‘Building knowledge and Plugging Skills Gap in Power Sector Reporting’, indicates a worrisome mismatch that government wants to plug.

He said the critical reforms that the government has embarked upon are designed to sustain the financial status of the market, ensure technical capacity to remove the deficit in supply to meet the demand of the country.”

According to him, the federal government has begun the implementation of the transmission expansion plan which works in sync with the government/Siemens Presidential Power Initiative – with phase one – (7,000mw), phase two – (11,000mw) and phase three (25,000mw) supply.

Ewelukwa said “this government is keen to implement these reforms. To be honest with you, we are having sleepless nights to achieve these.”

He said that government plans to keep expanding generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the country’s demand.

According to him, the distribution companies are also improving their performances and facilities to ensure improved power supply.

Explaining NBET’s function in the Transition Electricity Based Market, he said the design is to temporary bridge in the electricity market.

He said NBET has a long-term role to drive market competition by ensuring that it is moved from a government-centered market to a private-sector driven electricity market.

“We are enthusiastically looking at the point when we will actually start the innovation process of handing over the Power Purchase Agreements we signed to distribution licencees and eligible customers as the case may be,” he said.

James Sowole in Abeokuta","He said President Muhammadu Buhari’s desire towards the power sector was to ensure that the electricity supply industry is owned by both government and the private sectors.

"Makinde receives last batch of 3,300 participants in agribusiness project from Nasarawa",".

By Adeola Badru

Governor ‘Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Sunday, received batch eleven of the total three thousand three hundred participants of the state’s Youth Entrepreneurship Agribusiness Programme (YEAP), who just arrived in Ibadan from Nasarawa State after their training in agribusiness.

The youths numbering about three hundred who could not hide their joy and excitement sang and danced while recounting their experiences during the agribusiness training programme at Nasarawa State.

According to the Executive Adviser on Agribusiness Matters to Governor Makinde, Dr Debo Akande, represented by Mr. Olufemi Ilori, the Director of YEAP and Technical Service, Oyo State Agribusiness Development Agency, OYSADA, the training was part of the state government’s commitment towards preparing the youths ahead of the agricultural revolution in the state in term of acquisition of necessary skills to key into the government’s agricultural agenda.

The agribusiness training for youths in the state state which started on August 8, 202, has seen no fewer than three thousand three hundred youths drawn from across the 33 local government areas of the state including non indigenes residents in the state.

Dr Akande commended the governor for his unwavering commitment and support for the success of the training programme, saying that the next phase is to engage the 33 local government executive chairmen to provide land for the graduands to start deploying the acquired knowledge.

He also said state government has made provisions for financial support for the YEAP graduands which will be rolled out in batches to enable effective monitoring and guidance.

He said: “The journey to Nasarawa state started on 8th of August last year and has ended today. It was not an easy journey. We thank God that we never recorded any form of casualty from start ofbthe program till the end because Governor Makinde provided everything needed for the success we have recorded.”

“This is the eleventh batch of three hundred youths per batch making it three thousand three hundred persons. One hundred per local government because we have 33 local governments in Oyo State.”

“The significance of this training is the empowerment so that the youths can be able to take up the challenges of Agribusiness. After production what next? The value chain and what they have learned in Nasarawa as they have been well equipped for the work ahead.”

“The state government under the leadership of Governor Seyi Makinde has directed the various local governments to provide land for these youths which is one of the basic things they need.”

“The financial aspect has been guaranteed by the state government so that as the last batch arrived today the next step is do them to be set up.” Akande said.

He assured that the state government will commence implementation of the next phase as soon as possible, saying that all participants have been captured through biometric means.

Akande added that the farmlands which will be provided for agribusiness purpose will be given to the youths grouped into clusters for effective monitoring on their developmental process.

Some of the YEAP beneficiaries who spoke with journalists expressed their satisfaction towards the way and manner their welfare were being taken care of throughout the training programme, noting that the training was all agribusiness inclusive.

One of the beneficiaries, Adeyinka Okanlawon from Saki West Local Government Area of Oke-Ogun zone, expressed his appreciation to Makinde for the privilege to participate in what he described as very laudable and expository programme, saying that the training has exposed him to various opportunities in agribusiness.

Another beneficiary, Olajire Aduragbemi Kehinde from Ido Local Government Area of Ibadan, said she learnt many things she never knew from the training saying: “I really learnt alot from the training programme from the greenhouses to agrophonix the six ways of cultivating cassava without weeding as well as how to add value to farm produce keying into the agribusiness value chain.”

Niyi Oluwabunmi Esther from Ogbomoso North Local Government Area said going to Nasarawa has changed her perception about many things including keying into the agribusiness value chain to earn a decent living and being financially independent.

Excited Kolade Kehinde from Oyo East Local Government said: “actually we spent two weeks but that two weeks felt like years because when you go to certain places to learn and you return home having achieved your target then you’re ready to go.”

Another beneficiary, Oribamise Temitope, said she is ready to go into fish farming, describing Makinde as amiable and quintessential leader.

She commended the governor for initiating the programme for the youths saying, Makinde has thought the youths how to fish from the river.

“Kudos to you sir for working assiduously to turn things around for the best for us in Oyo State. We youths are solidly behind you and can assure you that your second term is certain because we will ensure you lead us to our desired end by continuing as our governor till 2027.”

Speaking on behalf of non indegenes who also be befitted from the training programme, the youths leader of Igala community in Oyo State, Ayatu Unubi Paul, said he is ready to go fully into maize farming, saying his choice was based on the high demand for the farm produce for consumption and also for further agro-feeds processing for fish production.","By Adeola BadruGovernor ‘Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Sunday, received batch eleven of the total three thousand three hundred participants of the state’s Youth Entrepreneurship Agribusiness Programme (YEAP), who just arrived in Ibadan from Nasarawa State after their training in agribusiness.

"Enugu shuts markets, offices as council poll holds Wednesday","Enugu State Government said yesterday that Wednesday will be a work-free day, as the local government election holds across the state.

It said markets, parks and offices would be closed, while movement of people and vehicles would be restricted from 8am to 4pm, except those on essential duties.

A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information, Steve Oruruo, said: “The Enugu State Government (ENSG) wishes to notify the public that local government election will hold on Wednesday across the state.

“Consequently, the government has declared a statewide work free day from 8am to 4pm to allow the people exercise their constitutional suffrage.

“During this period, markets and offices shall be closed and movement of persons and vehicles restricted, except for those on essential duties.

“Residents legally qualified to vote are therefore encouraged to go to the polls and cast their ballots.

“The government, in its unflinching commitment to safeguarding and strengthening our democracy, has made arrangements to guarantee a hitch-free process.”

However, the main opposition party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has promised to void the election through the courts if the Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) conducts the exercise without listing its candidates in the ballot.

The party, which had raised the alarm over alleged exclusion of its candidates from participating in the election, alleged that it had been stopped from participating because the list of its candidates were not published by the electoral body.

It accused ENSIEC of a plot to disenfranchise the party faithful by refusing to publish a list of 260 councillorship and 17 chairmanship candidates it forwarded to the electoral body in December 2021.

Addressing the disenfranchised candidates and other party faithful at the state secretariat, Enugu, at the weekend, the state Chairman of APC, Ugochukwu Agballah, said the party would void the election should the electoral body exclude it from participating in the exercise.

He said the legal team of the party, led by a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), had filed a suit at the state High Court to void the election for unlawful exclusion, which he noted was a breach of the Constitution and the Electoral Act.

He accused the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government of colluding with unscrupulous elements in the APC to manipulate ENSIEC to frustrate APC from participating in the poll.

Agballah, who received his certificate of returns from the APC national leadership on February 14, claimed that his emergence as the chairman caused fears within the ranks of the state government and the ruling party

He said: “Excluding APC is the greatest mistake by ENSIEC. The electoral body disenfranchised our candidates. We held our primaries to elect our chairmanship and councillorship candidates on December 18 and 19, 2021. We submitted the list to ENSIEC, which it accepted. But ENSIEC decided to publish a list submitted by Ben Nwoye, a former suspended caretaker chairman of APC. ENSIEC knows Nwoye is no longer the chairman. We had written letters to ENSIEC with an avalanche of evidence to show that I’m the duly elected chairman of the APC at our October 16, 2021 state congress.”

CP orders personnel deployment

Enugu State Police Commissioner Mr. Lawal Abubakar has ordered the deployment of personnel and policing resources to ensure a secure and peaceful conduct of local government election.

He gave the directive in a statement yesterday in Enugu by spokesman Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Daniel Ndukwe.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) had scheduled elections into the 260 councillorship and 17 council chairmanship positions for Wednesday.

The commissioner said the command was also committed to collaborating with other security agencies, local security outfits and stakeholders to provide security during the period of the elections and beyond.

He enjoined residents to remain vigilant, law-abiding and comply with the movement restriction order.

“They should report acts of electoral malpractice, violence and criminality to the nearest police station or by calling the command’s emergency hotlines on: 08032003702, 08075390883 or 08086671202; or by sending e-mails to:[email protected],” he said.","Enugu State Government said yesterday that Wednesday will be a work-free day, as the local government election holds across the state.

Governors meet Monday over new APC convention date,"By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintinsin, Abuja

Parley to set agenda for tomorrow’s talks with Buhari

Congresses to hold in zones

With the caretaker committee foot-dragging on plans for the party’s convention slated for Saturday, All Progressives Congress (APC) governors will meet today on the fate of the exercise.

The caretaker committee has not taken the needed steps to make the convention possible aside from notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

“No other steps necessary to show preparation for the convention has been taken by the caretaker committee, hence, the necessity for today’s meeting by the governors,” a source close to the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), said at the weekend.

- Advertisement -

It was learnt that today’s meeting will prepare grounds for tomorrow’s meeting of the governors and members of the Mai Mala-Buni led Caretaker Committee with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.

The meeting was shifted last week to enable the President to travel to Belgium for the European Union-Africa Union (EU-AU) Summit in Brussels.

The President returned on Saturday.

A source said the caretaker committee is planning to ask for a long shift of the convention, but some governors are believed to be angry about this.

They are said to be interested in a two-week shift from February 26 to March 12.

Part of the argument for the shift of date being proposed by the caretaker committee, it was learnt, is the need to hold the zonal congresses to elect the zonal vice chairmen before the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC).

Another argument is that the February 26 date coincides with by-elections in eight APC states.

The Saturday date is shaky because the caretaker committee has failed to unveil pre-convention activities, including zoning, sale of nomination forms, the inauguration of sub-committees and submission of forms.

Already, APC has ward, council and state executive committees in place.

The party’s Directorate of Organisation had been directed to prepare a schedule of activities and budget for zonal congresses.

The date for the zonal congress, however, will be released after the party leadership has secured the nod of President Buhari on zoning and micro-zoning.

It was gathered that apart from employing the zonal congress to buy more time, the arrangement was put in place by the caretaker committee to perfect the consensus mode of electing new party leaders and flag-bearers for the 2023 general elections.

A source, who pleaded anonymity, said the Caretaker Committee and some governors perfected the zonal congress arrangement while President Buhari was in Belgium and intend to sell the idea to him, with the support of some influential members of the Federal Executive Council.

The source said: “Having conducted congresses from the ward to the state level, the line of argument of the caretaker committee was that it will be proper to have zonal leaders of the party determined at their various geo-political zones for proper inclusiveness of party members.

“Hence, they (CECPC) will be proposing to Mr President the need for zonal congress before the national convention.”

APC governors’ meeting became imperative, following alleged foot-dragging by the caretaker committee.

The meeting may decide whether or not to go ahead with the convention scheduled for February 26.

But most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.

It was learnt that some governors have sent an emissary to President Buhari to feel his pulse on whether or not to postpone the convention.

Speculations about a likely revolt against Buni have made some governors to threaten a boycott of today’s session in Abuja.

The consensus among governors was still on the ceding of the office of the national chairman to the Northcentral.

The fresh proposal to anoint a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara as chairman received “little backing” last night.

According to a source, who spoke in confidence, most APC governors were unhappy with the Caretaker Committee for its ding-dong attitude to the convention.

The source said the governors could not fathom why the caretaker committee was yet to raise sub-committees for the exercise.

The source claimed that the split of the PGF into pro and anti-convention groups has deepened the cracks in the association.

The source said: “All is not well among APC governors over the convention because the Caretaker Committee is unwilling to stick to the agreed February 26 timeline. The committee wants to have its cake and eat it.

“Apart from funding, the Caretaker Committee has come up with an excuse that some off-season elections will hold on the convention date. It is contemplating a shift to March 12.

“Most governors are, however, insisting on February 26 having got wind of a plot to drag the convention till July or August when presidential and other primaries will be conducted. The CECPC members wanted a two-in-one convention.

“There are fears that the shift in convention date was being designed to either favour some members of the CECPC or their cronies for elective offices, including presidential and governorship seats in 2023.

“All these factors have made today’s meeting compelling.”

A governor, who spoke in confidence, said: “It is going to be a make or mar meeting to break the jinx on this convention. We will decide either on going ahead with the convention or a slight postponement which may be the last of such.

“We heard rumours of a new convention date of March 12 but the CECPC has not made recommendations to the PGF. Governors are being turned into ball boys.

“We now have pro and anti-convention governors simply because we can’t keep to an agreement on the date we chose because of 2023 ambitions.

“Left to some of us, we have had enough of CECPC unless the President decides otherwise. This is why there is tension among us.”

It was gathered that some governors were threatening to boycott today’s meeting which they suspected might “put Buni on the spot.”

Another source, who spoke on the intrigues, said: “Those planning to boycott the meeting have become desperate and trying to ensure that the PGF does not have the quorum at today’s meeting.

“They are afraid that governors may join issues with Buni and CECPC at the meeting.

“Some governors sent an emissary to the President last night on the need to intervene and give a definite direction.

“The way we are going, APC is closer to the crisis which made it to lose elections in Zamfara State in 2019.

“There are some forces pulling the strings to create a permanent crisis in APC.”

Many governors have insisted on an APC chairmanship slot for the Northcentral instead of the retention of the office by the Northeast.

It was learnt that the same anti-convention forces came up with the choice of ex-Speaker Yakubu Dogara to “prop up a new issue which could cause fresh confusion in the party.”

Another governor said: “Dogara is a good leader but his candidature is not flying because those behind it are mischievous.

“We had got to a point where some governors who didn’t know how APC was formed are trying to foist crisis on the party. They can’t eat their cake and have it.”","But most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.
