Court remands 4 men for allegedly burning Obasanjo’s mango farm,"A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi on Friday ordered the remand of four men in a correctional centre for allegedly conspiring and burning a Mango farm belonging to former President Olusegun Obasanjo.



The suspects: Julius Igyo, Samuel Aleva, Pius Mcha and Daniel Ortserga, are all of Howe town in Gwer-East Local Government Area of Benue.



They were charged with criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation, criminal trespass, mischief by fire and act of terrorism.



The Chief Magistrate, Mr Vincent Kor, did not take the plea of the suspects for want of jurisdiction and adjourned the matter until March 28 for further mention.



Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Ato, told the court that on Jan. 31, the Manager of the farm, Mr Suberu Mohammed, reported the incident to the Commissioner of Police in Benue.



Ato said the manager said that on Jan. 29, he received a phone call from his assistant, Gowon Tarkev, that fire had engulfed the farm.



He stated further that when he rushed to the farm, he discovered that fire had burnt down 90 hectares of the farm comprising 18,360 mango trees valued at N183.6 million.

The manager in his statement accused the suspects, Asande Ishor, Uger Jarpes, Moses Torchie and many others from Howe of being responsible for the incident.



He also said that the suspects earlier demanded for compensation over the land where the mango trees were planted.



Mohammed said that the suspects and their accomplices had terrorised them in the farm by beating them, threatening their lives and cutting down the mango trees.



The prosecutor said the suspects were arrested during police investigation while others were still at large.



He said the offences contravened the provisions of sections 97, 398, 349 and 338 of the Penal Code, Laws of Benue, 2004.

Court voids suit seeking removal of Ekiti Varsity VC,"A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Friday, rejected a suit seeking to invalidate the appointment of Prof. Abayomi Fasina as the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE).

Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a judgment, ruled that the plaintiff, Tableland Society For the Oppressed (TSFO), lacked the legal right to institute the suit.

Justice Ekwo further held that plaintiff failed to establish that it was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to engage in public interest litigation and question the activities of government’s agencies.

The judge, who upheld the defendants’ preliminary objection, denied jurisdiction over the case.

He, thereafter, struck out the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/250/2021.

Listed as defendants in the suit are the Minister of Education; the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; the Chairman of FUOYE’s Governing Council; the institution’s Registrar; the Chairman, National University Commission and Prof. Fasina.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that TSFO had argued that Fasina was not qualified for the appointment having allegedly been indicted for wrong doing and having also not done well in the interview during the selection process.

It accused the university’s Governing Council of manipulating selection process to favour Fashina.

The plaintiff prayed the court to, among others, void Fasina’s appointment and order the conduct of fresh appointment process.

The group stated that “the 6th defendant (Fasina) was indicted by the committee set up by Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, for collecting double salary from both Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti and Federal University Oye-Ekiti.

“Section 42 of the Constitution has been violated by the appointment of the 6th defendant, who failed the selection interview organised.

“The defendants have all endorsed and unjustly conferred the position of the Vice Chancellor on the 6th defendant who is not qualified at the expense of qualified candidates purely on the basis of discrimination.

Fuel Scarcity: Adulterated fuel damages our vehicles – RTEAN,"Alhaji Olayinka Onikijipa, the Chairman of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) in Kwara, has said that the adulterated fuel in circulation has damaged some of their vehicles.

Onikijipa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Friday that the fuel scarcity had given some unpatriotic people the opportunity to exploit Nigerians.

“This is a very sad situation we have found ourselves; the adulterated fuel in circulation has damaged two of our vehicles.

“I think many more were damaged, but have not been reported officially to the association. This situation has brought back memories of bad governance in our nation.

“We spend the whole day at the fuel station, yet still buying adulterated fuel, it has affected our business negatively,” he said.

He, however, called on the government to be proactive and ensure that regulatory bodies were up to the task of protecting citizens and their interests.

The chairman said interstate transportation fare had not increased, but they may be forced to increase it, if the scarcity persisted.

“Transportation fare remains the same for now, but if scarcity persists, I do not know what can happen.

“Some bad people have capitalised on the situation to exploit Nigerians because people are complaining of buying fuel above the pump price where it is available.

“This is bad; we do not have to inconvenience ourselves. We should all have the love of this nation at heart.

“The government should be more proactive in their responsibilities to the citizens.

“And I want to advise those hoarding fuel in their vehicles, home and shops to stop the practice; it can wreak havoc at any time.

Battle over APC convention: PMP Presidential candidate pushes hard to clinch APC secretary,"…Senator Osita Izunaso struggles

…Uzodimma silence causes confusion – Stakeholders

By Chinonso Alozie

The 2011 presidential candidate of the Peoples Mandate Party, PMP, Batos Nwadike, and Special Adviser on political affairs to Imo governor, Hope Uzodimma, has not relented in his move to grab the position of the National Secretary of the APC, ahead of the APC National convention on 26 February 2022.

Vanguard gathered that Nwadike has set up his campaign team, which happened on Friday in Abuja.

But Nwadike has remained silent on whether he has the full backing of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma, in this political journey.

In another move, Senator Osita Izunaso has been making such a move to becoming the next National Secretary of APC.

But the two camps of Nwadike, and Senator Izunaso, have been in a long race to edge each other out of the contest as well as get the endorsement

of the key players at the convention.

Vanguard gathered from some of the APC, stakeholders, who pleaded not to mention their names said: “The silence of the governor can confuse the party. He should be able to call his children together so that they will not go to the convention with divided minds.

“Maybe the governor will do that at the last minute. That is what he’s waiting for. We think that his intervention will reduce the level of acrimony and spending of resources by those aspiring to that position from the Imo APC, chapter.

“Another thing is that has the APC, agreed to zone the position to the South East? Let us not go and waste our resources in this battle. Let us be careful.

“Another thing worrisome with the way the convention arrangement is going on will the convention still hold on that 26 February, that is another issue. But let us keep watching.”","But Nwadike has remained silent on whether he has the full backing of the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma, in this political journey.

Amotekun: Arewa youths caution Ondo Governor over alleged harassment of northerners,"The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYCF) on Friday, cautioned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to end the constant harassment of northerners in the state by the Amotekun security outfit.

A statement signed by the Forum’s National President, Yerima Shettima alleged that on many occasions, Amotekun corps personnel have picked up and harassed northerners in the state for just no cause.

The statement said the existence of SSS, the Army, Amotekun, NSCDC and other security personnel is to protect lives and properties and not to harass residents

It added that the Amotekun Corps which is state-owned should not be used arbitrarily against the few northerners in the state, who are just going about their legitimate businesses.

The statement informed the governor that, as northerners are in the state for their legitimate businesses, so also, there are westerners spread across the northern parts of the country.

Shettima added that, if the same unnecessary maltreatment, hatred and harassment is meted out to them, there will be no peace in the country.

It warned that, if the government of Ondo State allows such intimidation and harassment to continue, without justification, it would mean that he does not want northerners in his state.","The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYCF) on Friday, cautioned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to end the constant harassment of northerners in the state by the Amotekun security outfit.

NULGE alerts Soludo of alleged subletting of Anambra’s revenue windows to politicians,"Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has raised alarm over the alleged sublet of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof Chukwuma Soludo had recently threatened to revoke all revenue windows allocated to politicians, through an executive order on the morning of his swearing-in.

NULGE on Friday claimed it has information that the state revenue board was allocating revenue windows to their cronies, with the intent to hijack the state’s resources, especially as the Governor Willie Obiano administration winds down.

The state president of the group, Mr Chikwelu Adigwe who briefed members of the union at the state secretariat of the union in Awka said most of the revenue windows being sold out belong to the local government areas.

The president also protested the highjacking of most revenues being collected by the local government councils, thereby rendering them useless.

“The condition of our service is no longer acceptable to us, so we want to make our voices heard.

“We are doing all we can during this transition period to ensure that the right things are done. We have written to the transition committee, we have also written to the assembly to complain about the continuous confirmation of transition committee chairmen, instead of holding local government elections.

“Right now, we have it on good authority that the state revenue board is still allocating revenue windows to politicians, and we want to warn the governor-elect about this.

“We are here today to complain about the way the system is running. The system was not like this when we came into the service. Things have gone so bad.

“When we were in school, we heard that there were three tiers of government, but gradually, the local government has been rendered redundant and inexistent. Our job is gradually being taken away by the state, but we will not allow this to continue.”

The union said it has resolved to take back all revenue windows belonging to it, including stallage fees, wheelbarrow levies, liquor licenses and many others, which have been taken from them by the state government.

The union also urged Soludo to ensure the conduct of local government elections within three months of his swearing-in, ensure the reconstitution of the Local Government Service Commission to include local government workers, instead of an all-politicians affairs, among others.

“We have charged our members to go out and collect revenues due to their various local government councils. Any shop owner who pays revenue touts should be ready to pay twice. We are not preaching war here, but we will not run away from war,” Adigwe said.","Less than one month to the end of Governor Willie Obiano’s administration in Anambra State, the leadership of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has raised alarm over the alleged sublet of the state’s revenue windows to politicians.

Abuja court strikes out suit seeking Federal University Vice Chancellor’s sack,"A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday struck out a suit seeking to void the appointment of Professor Abayomi Sunday Fasina as the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) in Ekiti state.

Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo, in a judgment, held that the plaintiff – Tableland Society For the Oppressed (TSFO) – lacked the locus standi to institute the suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/250/2021.

Justice Ekwo further held that the plaintiff failed to establish that it was registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to engage in public interest litigation and question the activities of government’s agencies.

The judge, who upheld the defendants’ preliminary objection, denied jurisdiction over the case and proceeded to strike it out.

Listed as defendants in the suit are the Minister of Education, the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti; the Chairman of FUOYE’s Governing Council; the institution’s Registrar; the Chairman, National University Commission and Prof. Fasina.

TSFO had argued among others that Fasina was not qualified for the appointment having allegedly been indicted for wrongdoing and having also not done well in the interview during the selection process.

It accused the university’s Governing Council of manipulating the selection process to favour Fashina.

Gunmen attack Okomu Oil Palm Company to avenge arrest of two suspects – Olise,"From Tony Osauzo, Benin

Gunmen on Thursday, reportedly attacked Okomu Oil Palm Company in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State, barely a day after two suspects were paraded by the State Police Command over their involvement in a February 1 attack in which two staff killed and 90 hectares of the Company’s rubber estate and three excavators were burnt.

The Company’s Communication officer, Fidelis Olise, who disclosed this yesterday, said the gunmen had earlier carried out attack on Tuesday, making it two attacks in the three days.

Describing the gunmen as terrorists, Olise said they carried out the latest attacks in retaliation of the arrest of two of their supposed members.

“The same terrorists, seemingly angered by the arrest of two of their supposed members carried out further attacks on innocent workers on the Okomu Oil Palm Company’s property to avenge the arrest of their accomplices who apparently confessed to the theft of rubber. They were arrested by the Marine Police on a boat after it had left the Okomu Ijaw Community on its way to Delta State.

“The killing of innocent workers who are performing their legitimate duties and have no conflict or disagreement with any person is strongly condemned and the powers that be should immediately take action against those terrorists responsible for these murderous crimes.

“Attacks on companies like Okomu, are also a serious note for concern as it seems that terrorists are now focusing on these types of establishments, intent on bringing them to their knees, and in so doing creating an environment that could show the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led Government as weak. It also poses a great threat to current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria as a whole, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the Buhari administrations.

“The time has come for the Buhari and Obaseki administrations to take concerted and decisive actions against these terrorists, otherwise investment in the agricultural sector will be greatly discouraged just as was the case with pipeline vandalization in the past, with the resultant negative effect on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both state and federal government coffers.

“The Police must immediately undertake a thorough investigation and bring all those linked to the heinous attacks to book, thereby showing that they are a force to be reckoned with, and reinstating confidence in their ability to fight crime. The army too should be deployed to ensure that this area of Ovia South West Local Government Area is safe for all, while terrorists and cultists are rooted from this area for good”, the Okomu Oil Palm Company further stated.","The Company’s Communication officer, Fidelis Olise, who disclosed this yesterday, said the gunmen had earlier carried out attack on Tuesday, making it two attacks in the three days.

"Transport fare skyrockets, commuters stranded as fuel queues persist","From Uche Usim, Abuja

The price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol hit N700 per litre in Abuja, yesterday, even as residents have described the protracted scarcity as a worse-than-hell-experience.

From Kubwa to Wuse, Maitama to Asokoro, most of the filling stations had ran out of fuel while the few that sold had long queues. At bus stops, scores of commuters were stranded as fewer commercial vehicles plied the roads.

Nigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.

The scarcity also forced Bolt and Uber hailing cabs to cancel their booking even as transport fares rose significantly due to demand outpacing supply. Cost of transport from Kubwa to Wuse jumped from N200 to N350.

A taxi driver, David Adams, told Daily Sun that most filling stations preferred to sell between midnight and 4am to enable them sell at black market rates.

“I bought petrol somewhere in Zone 4 around 3am. I slept there actually. The situation is worse than last week,” he said.

Marcus Anaga, another taxi driver said: “Right now, we call each other to know the filling station to go and sleep to get petrol.”

Other residents who spoke with Daily Sun regretted that the scarcity has disrupted economic and social activities and made the FCT chaotic. They queried why the scarcity has persisted despite assurances from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), oil marketers and other stakeholders that the trend would ease.

They also queried the veracity of NNPC’s claims of injecting 3.2 billion litres of petrol into the domestic market saying rather than have petrol to buy, filling stations in the FCT were either empty or flooded with thousands of frustrated consumers queuing endlessly to buy petrol.

It was observed that black market price of petrol that was hitherto N400 per litre earlier in the week had jumped to N700 even as motorists were forced to part with N500 tip for a jerrycan before petrol attendants were allowed to sell to them.

A black market dealer who identified himself as Aliyu said: “I buy petrol for N300 a litre from the pump and sell at N700 per litre. I’m making good sales. The scarcity is good.”

Mohammed, another black market operator, said products were available as from midnight.

“I buy at night, around 2am. When day breaks, I sell to rich men and women who don’t have time to queue at filling stations. I sell 10 litres for N6,500.”

Daily Sun observed that most of the petrol tankers have been parked at various filling stations for days without product to discharge.

The scarcity has badly impacted small and medium enterprises who rely on petrol generators to run their businesses.

Some supermarket owners in Abuja lamented that frozen foods in their freezers were defrosting and losing freshness due to lack of petrol to power their generators.

“Diesel is now N400 per litre, petrol price is worse, electricity is not stable. I dare not refuse to run my diesel and petrol generators if I want to remain in business. The chicken and ice cream sections are delicate. They can easily melt and decay. This is hell,” Mrs Ajani of CKD Supermarket in Kubwa lamented.","From Kubwa to Wuse, Maitama to Asokoro, most of the filling stations had ran out of fuel while the few that sold had long queues.

"365 Days to Presidential Election, the Aspirants are Emerging","Obinna Chima and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

Today makes it exactly a year to the 2023 presidential election and aspirants in the two main political parties – the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) – as well as some other parties, are positioning for the most coveted office in the land. They have started to throw their hats in the ring to indicate their interest.

Even though the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has yet to blow the whistle to signal the start of electioneering, the political space is buzzing with the activities of potential aspirants who have started doing the leg work early – meeting critical stakeholders in an effort to sell their aspiration and win critical endorsement.

Although about 11 individuals from diverse backgrounds have formally declared their intentions to vie for their party’s ticket, many of the big names being touted as nursing presidential ambitions are yet to make a formal announcement even though their footprints are all over the political space. Every occasion, official or unofficial is now a rally of sort with political undertone.

In the next few months the political space is expected to be crowded with the big names currently holding consultations in secret and in not so secret places – finally coming out to formally make their pitch.

Here are those who have declared so far.

Bola Tinubu

Since the former Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his desire to succeed him, he has been busy moving round the country and consulting with different interest groups and individuals. Already, groups such as SWAGA, the acronym for “South-West Agenda for Asiwaju,” populated by Tinubu’s acolytes and yes men, are already touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature.

Sam Ohuabunwa

The immediate past president of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, has declared to contest the position of the President in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ohuabunwa who had lamented worsening socio-economic and political conditions in the country, strongly believes he has what it takes to transform Nigeria. He said the greatest challenge that propelled his presidential ambition was the need to produce a new Nigeria where injustice is ruled out.

Anyim Pius Anyim

The former Senate President, and one time Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Anyim has declared his interest in the presidential race. He feels it was time for someone from the South-east to lead the country and has vowed to contest, whether the presidential slot is zoned to his zone or not. He strongly believes the next president should be able to rebuild, protect lives and property, revive the economy, create jobs and rehabilitate the collapsed educational system. According to him, the task ahead called for a candidate who possesses the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the PDP to accomplish the tasks. He believes he has what it takes to govern the country, particularly in these trying times.

Dele Momodu

Dele Momodu last month declared his presidential ambition in his hometown, Ihevbe, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State. According to the journalist and publisher of Ovation International magazine, he remains the most qualified among those aspiring to take over from Buhari next year. He insists that he might not have been a governor, senator, minister but he has sat with the high and mighty, adding that he’s qualified to become the president of the country.

Kingsley Moghalu

A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu has also declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Moghalu had said his decision to contest again for president was driven by concern for suffering Nigerians who seek an alternative to the status quo. The former CBN deputy governor contested the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in 2019 and has since moved to the African Democratic Congress (ADC).

Chukwuka Monye

43-year-old technocrat, Chukwuka Monye, in January, said the time to take over the governance from the older generation is now. To this end, the Delta State-born social innovator has declared his intention to contest for the president in the 2023 general elections. Monye whose slogan is “our future is now” wondered how the founding fathers would be content with Nigeria’s current state. Monye, is however, yet to state the party platform which he intends to contest.

Rochas Okorocha

The Imo West senator, Rochas Okorocha, recently made known his interest to contest for the office of the president in the 2023 general elections. In a letter to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, dated January 25, the former Imo State governor said what Nigeria needs right now is someone who is “detribalised” and can unite the country. This would be the third consecutive time the politician who claims to have built several schools for under-privileged Nigerians across the country would be throwing his hat in the ring.

Aminu Tambuwal

Aminu Tambuwal, is the current Sokoto state governor. The politician would be seeking to realise his ambition under the Peoples Democratic Party. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who declared his intention after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Sokoto, recently, said that he is not only well prepared but also ready to fix the numerous problems of the country. Generally perceived as urbane, Tambuwal will face off against other contenders in the opposition party during the party’s convention.

David Umahi

The present Ebonyi State Governor , David Umahi, declared his 2023 presidential ambition at the State House, in Abuja, coming about 24 hours after former Governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, also indicated an interest in the race. Both men are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi, speaking at a press briefing after meeting with Buhari, said his presidency will replicate his “progressive efforts” in Ebonyi at the national level. The Chairman of the South-east Governors’ Forum said he intends to bring a business-like spirit to governance, claiming that Buhari responded to his interest by asking him to seek the support of the people when he met with him to intimate the president of his intention.

Yahaya Bello

The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was one of the earliest Nigerians to have shown interest to aspire for the 2023 presidency under the banner of the ruling APC. Bello, however opened up in Bauchi, while addressing APC legislators as well as women groups from the North-east during an extraordinary meeting held in Bauchi at Hazibal hotel sometime ago.

The Kogi governor who has always touted his youthful age as an advantage, has described the task ahead as an enormous one.

Sani Yerima

The ex-Zamfara governor, Sani Yerima, has also declared his intention to govern the country. The politician while speaking during a BBC Hausa Service programme “Gane Mani Hanya” monitored in Gusau, said since Buhari is ending his second term, he (Yerima) would continue to pursue his presidential ambition.

“If God spares my life, by 2023 I would go into the contest for the post of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ” Yerima said.

Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi

An entrepreneur and youth development advocate, the young Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi, has promised to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace if given the platform to do so. She promised to harness the power of Nigerian teeming youths to unleash the country’s latent potential, which she described as a force to be reckoned with globally. She is the daughter of former Federal Commissioner of Works and Housing, Lateef Femi Okunnu (SAN).

Some of Those Yet to Declare…

Yemi Osinbajo

With the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, there are expectations that he would declare his interest in the coming days. Osinbajo clearly comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but appears to be keeping his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much. However, Nigerians are watching to see how Osinbajo would go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Tinubu, to actualise his ambition.

Atiku Abubakar

Despite the seeming opposition against his candidature, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023. Atiku’s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023. While some interest groups recently advised the former vice president not to contest and have labelled him the serial presidential aspirant, Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.

Godwin Emefiele

There has been an increasing call for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to join the presidential race. A technocrat with alluring pedigree – No doubt a breath of fresh in the political arena. Although Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone that he is running for president even as he is constitutionally qualified to so do, he has said he remains focused on his job and would continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government’s economic recovery drive. Emefiele also believes it’s the prerogative of President Buhari to plan his succession for the continuing peace and progress of Nigeria.

Bukola Saraki

The former Governor of Kwara State has not held any elaborate event to declare his ambition, but he has hinted on several occasions on his active Twitter and Facebook accounts, that he would likely be running for the most-sought-after position. On one occasion recently, the former President of the Senate, relayed an encounter with a follower on Twitter, who charged him to run and in his response, hinted at the possibility.

“Earlier, I replied to a follower of mine on Twitter, who like thousands of you, has been clamouring for a united front to #RescueNigeria. As we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us,” he had said.

Rotimi Amaechi

Even though former Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi has not declared his intention, some interest groups in the country have been nudging him to throw his hat in the battle to succeed the president. Some believe that at 56, Amaechi does not have the burden of old age-related health challenges associated with some aspirants. Many people have linked the 2023 presidency to his recent coronation as: Dan Amanah Daura, which translates to mean the ‘Trusted son of Daura.’

Bala Mohammed

Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed has said he is likely to run for president in the 2023 election under the PDP. Presently, he is consulting with stakeholders across the country and recently met with former president Goodluck Jonathan.

Nigeria Set for 5G Rollout as FG Releases Spectrum Allocation,"•NCC to licence operators after February 27

Emma Okonji in Lagos and Oghenevwede Ohwovoriole in Abuja

The federal government yesterday in Abuja, officially handed over Spectrum Allocation for 5G deployment to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).

The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who doubles as the Chairman of the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), did the official handover of the Spectrum Allocation for 5G licence to the NCC during a workshop on the National Policy on 5G Networks and handover of Spectrum Allocation for deployment, in Abuja.

Aside the official handover of the 5G spectrum to the NCC, the Minister also did an official public handover of the National Policy on 5G Network for Nigeria’s Digital Economy to the NCC.

Based on the official handover of the 5G spectrum, the NCC was expected to licence winners of the 5G spectrum after February 27, when it must have given full update of the payment of the licence fees by the winners, to enable 5G network rollout in the country.

NCC was expected to make formal announcement on the update of payment for 5G licence on February 27, 2022, in line with the Information Memorandum for 3.5GHz spectrum, which is the 5G licence spectrum.

The Commission had on December 13, 2021, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, successfully auctioned two slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum band to MTN Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, at a bid price of $273.6 million for each operator.

The successful auction of the 3.5GHz spectrum band would pave way for the issuance of a fifth generation (5G) licence that would facilitate the deployment of 5G network across Nigeria.

After the successful auction of the spectrum, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, had announced that the winners were expected to make payment for the spectrum license, on or before February 24, 2022, to enable them roll out the 5G network across the country.

Before the successful spectrum auction in December last year, the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), was occupying five slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum, but vacated two slots, which were handed over to the National Frequency Management Council, chaired by the Minister.

Pantami advised state governors to look beyond the money they would collect from network operators who will deploy the 5G in their states, but see the gain that its deployment would bring to their respective states and the Nigerian economy in general.

Pantami said, “The issue of right of way becomes a challenge from time to time. The government has addressed the issue more than ninety per cent but from time to time issues may come. I do hope that they will understand the economic benefit. The security benefits and many more of these technological advancement.

“It is beyond right of way charges. It goes beyond that. So let us try to make the process very easy for operators so that they will be able to deploy 5G.”

He added that the adoption of 5G technologies and its roll out would support in the development of Nigeria’s digital economy

“5G will provide very fast and reliable communication for our security personnel and allow then to swiftly access relevant data required to carry out their duties. The time required to access data for records from hours minutes.

“5G will allow for real time high quality and data intensive surveillance of relevant areas using high definition cameras.

“Emerging technologies like Blockchain can significantly improve transparency to the delivery of government services at all levels.

“The World Economic Forum attests to the potential of Blockchain to increase the efficiency and fairness of government system and by extension limit opportunities for corruption.

It can significantly improve transparency in procurement procedures enhance land and registry system, ensure that government documents are not accessed by unauthorised personal,” he stressed

The minister also spoke on the national policy on 5G deployment in the country, saying, “the National Policy for 5G diploma in Nigeria for our country’s digital economy is also going to be distributed after the luncheon we use the occasion for the public presentation of the policy and we encourage our stakeholders to look into it and ensure a very successful implementation of the policy on what we had been doing.

“According to February 2021 report by Accentuate, 5G-enabled factories can see up to 2O-30 per cent in overall productivity gains including improvement of 50 per cent in assemble time.

These are only a few examples to show how 5G can have a positive impact on our economy,” he added.

In his contribution, Danbatta said: “On the 25th January, 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari, unveiled the National Policy on 5G Networks at the Presidential Villa.

“This singular action triggered today’s event – the presentation of the 5G policy to the general public and for our critical stakeholders to officially witness the National Frequency Management Council presenting the Spectrum allocated for 5G technology to the Nigerian Communications Commission. To all members of the National Frequency Management Council, your efforts are truly appreciated and your recommendations have been immensely helpful.”

Former Secretary General and Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) and CEO of Tetconsult, UK and Nigeria, Shola Taylor, who presented the lead paper on the benefits of 5G deployment in Nigeria, said: “5G is a reality and the impact on our lives is real and the benefits are endless. Nigeria is already in it. We have started well and must be prepared for the disruption that will come in spite of the challenges. We cannot go back. We cannot remain where we are so the only option is to move forward and move quickly.”

Giving details about 5G network, Taylor said 5G would continue to be attractive and revolutionary in nation building because it offers lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth. “This means higher data speeds, faster connections for use by individuals and businesses,” Taylor added.

The Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Aziz, said the success of the implementation of the policy would largely depend of good collaboration between all stakeholders in the country.

Also, the Director General Galaxy Back Bone, Prof. Mohammed Abubarka, said the deployment of 5G and the implementation of the nation’s digital policy would help to achieve President Buhari’s government’s transparency and boost the economy.

"Emefiele: CBN Passionate about Youth Empowerment, Economic Restructuring","Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba

Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has expressed commitment to various programmes targeted at youth empowerment and restructuring of the Nigerian economy in order to move it away from its over-dependence on oil revenue.

The CBN governor who made the remarks at a two-day CBN Fair, which opened in Asaba yesterday, said he was passionate about empowering youths, especially young graduates through various initiatives to support small and medium scale enterprises as well as agricultural support schemes.

He noted that the unprecedented rice pyramid witnessed in Abuja, recently and the over 160 per cent rise in the number of rice mills in the country was an evidence that the CBN’s intervention in agriculture sector was yielding fruits.

Similarly, he said the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) of the apex bank and other development finance interventions greatly helped in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through the various palliatives that Nigerians benefited from.

He stressed the need for all hands to be on the deck to tackle the economic challenges facing Nigeria.

The Corporate Communications Director, CBN, Mr. Osita Nwanisoba, who represented Emiefele, at the fair, noted that growing a diversified economy that would meet contemporary challenges in a sustainable manner underscored the intervention programmes of the apex bank.

He stressed the need for Nigerians to understand the history of their economy and to know how they could key into the numerous intervention programmes and schemes designed to restructure the country’s economic base from its monoculture status.

He assured that the CBN has been consistently proactive in ensuring that its initiatives were in tune with global trends, including digitalisation and smart internet innovations in the financial world.

He said the fact that Nigeria was the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency, the e-Naira on October 26, 2021, testified to the proactive state of the CBN.

He said, “First and foremost, it is important for us to know where we are coming from and where we are going, because the understanding of the past will help us to understand why the CBN is doing what it is doing. Like I said, Nigeria is a mono-product economy; mono-product because 90 per cent of our foreign exchange (FX) revenue come from oil and about 60 per cent of our expenditure also comes from oil. What this means is that whenever there is a shock out there it immediately translates to our economy.

“So, it becomes even more problematic for the CBN to be able to deal with its mandate. And, we have a clear mandate, which we understand, but we feel that to be able to actualise this mandate, there are other things we need to do, and that is, to stimulate growth, to grow the economy in a sustainable manner.

“What the CBN is doing is to diversify the economic base of this country. We are saying that there are so many and so much that we can do. We have agriculture, we have manufacturing. So, why can we deal with these things so that we will be able to produce what we eat and eat what we produce?

“Basically, that is why the CBN is intervening in the critical sectors of the economy. These are sectors that would grow the economy, create jobs, ensure that there is export so that we will be able to moderate our exchange rate and earn even more FX and grow our external reserves.”

On the significance of the e-Naira to the central bank’s efforts to restructure the economy, the representative of the CBN governor said there was need to move the country in the direction other economies were going.

“I think the first thing we have to understand is that we are gradually moving into what I will call the knowledge economy. We have also seen what digitalisation is doing across the world. Like I said earlier, as countries begin to move away from more fossil fuel to digital economy, it becomes imperative that you need to be at pace with what is going on.

“Today, we to talk about a web economy, we talk about internet economy, we talk about quantum computing and the rest of them.

“So, Nigeria felt that we needed to deal with this, leveraging on the sophisticated payment infrastructure that we have and launched its own digital currency. It is the first in Africa. It’s quite phenomenal. I think it is the sixth in the world.”

“Recently, we launched the TIES – the Tertiary Institution Entrepreneurship Scheme – the whole essence is to empower the youths so that they will unleash their productive potentials.

“Therefore, some of the takeaways from this fair is that the CBN is a listening institution. Like the CBN Governor always say, that he wants a people-centred central bank. Two, to understand that there are interventions of the CBN and to know how to leverage these interventions.”

"Power Supply: FG Targets 27,000 Homes, Signs €9.3m Deal for Provision of 23-Mini-grids Nationwide","Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja

The federal government has signed an Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme (IMAS) deal with eight indigenous solar mini-grid developers for the establishment of 23 mini-grids across 11 states of the country.

Expected to generate a 5.4-kilowatt peak to connect about 27,600 households, and impact over 138,000 Nigerians in two years, the €9.3 million project is being coordinated by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) with support from the European Union and the German government.

At the award signing ceremony, the Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, said the programme was geared towards achieving the country’s vision of generating at least 30, 000 megawatts of electricity by 2030.

Jedy-Agba noted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was always open to opportunities that would achieve the acceleration of electricity in Nigeria.

According to him, the national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, vision 30:30:30 aim at achieving 30,000 megawatts of electricity by the year 2030, with renewable energy contributing 30 per cent of the energy mix. To achieve this, the minister stated that Nigeria would have to construct over a thousand mini-grids of 100 kilowatts.

The minister added that it was important to continue to find creative and innovative ways to achieve the objective, and one of which was through collaborating with development partners and the private sector.

He added: “We understand that one of the major bottlenecks for the private sector’s involvement is financing, hence, the reason the NESP and REA have worked closely to develop and implement the scheme.”

The eight local solar mini-grid developers include Acob Lighting Technology Limited, Gve Projects, Nayo Tropical Technology Limited, Rubitec Nigeria Limited and Darway Coast Nigeria Limited, Synergy Limited, Sosa-Protergia Joint Development Company Limited, and A4&T Power Solutions Limited.

They would receive in-kind grants through the REA with support of the European Union and the German Government within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).

The indigenous developers are expected to establish 23 mini-grids across 11 states, which include, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Anambra, and Cross River.

Earlier, the Managing Director of REA, Ahmad Salihijo said the scheme was aimed at bridging the funding gap affecting indigenous developers in the renewable energy sector.

“It is our hope that the signatures we put down today in these documents set a precedent for the new and improved power and energy sector in Nigeria.

“As an agency, we encourage investors to explore the solar mini-grid sector. However, one major constraint to this is usually financing. This is why the REA, with the support of NESP, is working together to alleviate this bottleneck.

“We do this by providing in-kind grants to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,” he stressed.

According to him, the main objective of the intervention is to design and test a tender model for interconnected solar mini-grids, leading to the foundation of the scheme.

“The wonderful thing about the IMAS project is that we have ensured that all the developers are Nigerians. This is to say that the Nigerian energy sector has come a long way from what it used to be and we are proud of this,” he explained.

Head of programme, NESP, Benjamin Duke, assured that his team would continue to work to build investors’ confidence in the sector by developing an accurate electricity market intelligence that will provide investors with accurate data about the country’s electricity needs.

Also speaking at the ceremony, the Executive Director, Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Sanusi Ohiare, said while investors were being encouraged to explore the solar mini-grid sector, one major constraint to their project development was finance.

“Hence, the REA with the support of NESP was able to alleviate this major burden by providing capital in-kind grant to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,” he noted.

Head of Section, Green Economy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Inga Stefanowicz, noted that the EU’s financial support for the programme represents the EU’s commitment to support Nigeria in the efforts to enable more investments in the solar mini-grid sector.

“We hope that our contribution will help improve access to reliable and affordable electricity in Nigeria, especially in the disadvantaged areas of the country, hence advancing the living standard of the rural and peri-urban dwellers using renewable sources of energy,” she stated.

Country Director of GIZ Nigeria & ECOWAS, Ina Hommers, said the provision of capital in-kind grants to the developers in the solar mini-grid sector through the IMAS aimed to ensure higher investments in the sector.

“Therefore, the grants contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria, in particular SDG 7 on access to affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. These represent one of the focal areas of GIZ’s support to Nigeria,” Hommers stressed.

Depending on the ability of the private sector, between 18 to 24 solar mini-grid projects will be deployed in 2022 under the project, serving clean electricity to around 138,000 people in Nigeria.

"Nigerian Air Force, Customs Partner To Secure Borders, Tackle Banditry, Smuggling, Others","The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to partner in order to strengthen border security and stem the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points.

NAF spokesperson Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet disclosed this in a statement on Thursday.

According to the Gabkwet, the air force is expected to make available on request 2 of its pilots to assist with the operation of NCS Bell-427 helicopters.

The statement read, “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to synergize their efforts towards strengthening border security and stemming the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points. To this end, the NAF is expected to make available on request 2 of its pilots to assist with the operation of NCS Bell-427 helicopters and by so doing complement the manpower of NCS Air-Wing.

“This information is part of the content of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently consummated between both organizations. The MoU specifically sets out the terms of a joint commitment, which is expected to enhance efficiency in the areas of port and border patrols to curtail activities of smuggling syndicates across the country.”

Speaking at the event, which was held at the NCS Headquarters, Abuja, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, who was represented by the Director of Operations, Headquarters NAF, Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Nnamdi Ananaba stated that the NAF will continue to encourage partnership with other security agencies as well as provide aircraft maintenance support so as to enhance the fight against all forms of insecurity in the country.

He added that the NAF partnership with the NCS was a clear indication of the need for synergy and inter-agency cooperation, particularly between military and para-military organizations.

“The MoU will go a long way in building on the already existing cordial and cooperative relationship as well as ensure seamless collaboration between our organizations,” he said.

Air Vice-Marshal Ananaba went on to note that the current security challenges in the country call for the need to bridge the gap and divide that disconnects the military and other government agencies in order to work towards achieving a common goal.

The Comptroller General of NCS, Colonel Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd), in his remarks, noted that the partnership with the NAF will no doubt improve NCS’ air operations and anti-smuggling efforts particularly as it intensifies efforts in checkmating small arms proliferation across the country.

Ali also thanked the CAS for offering to deploy NAF pilots to NCS’ air operations wing, so as to enhance its anti-smuggling operations.

He also called on the NAF and other Services to consider partnering with the NCS in the areas of capacity building and purposeful manpower development to improve the output of NCS personnel.

Specifically, the customs boss requested the assistance of the armed forces of Nigeria in the training of NCS personnel in para-trooping and other related fields. This, according to him, became necessary in view of inaccessible areas used as smuggling routes which are mostly unmotorable and difficult to navigate, hence the need for the NCS to begin to consider inserting its troops in these locations via para-dropping.

The MoU signing ceremony had in attendance key management staff of NCS as well as senior officers from the NAF.","The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have agreed to partner in order to strengthen border security and stem the tide of banditry and smuggling activities around Nigerian borders and entry points.

Blessing Okagbare gets 10-year ban for doping,"The disciplinary tribunal of Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has handed Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian sprinter, a 10-year ban for breaching multiple anti-doping rules.

According to the statement released by AIU on Friday, the Nigerian got a five-year ban for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and another half-a-decade for her refusal to cooperate with the body’s investigation of her case.

The sprinter was suspended indefinitely during the Tokyo Olympics after the AIU had adjudged her to have tested positive for human growth hormone in one of the out-of-competition drug examinations she did in Slovakia on July 19.

She was thereafter slammed with three separate anti-doping charges by the body in October 2021.

In January 2022, the US department of justice had also allegedly identified Okagbare among the exhibits gathered against Eric Lira, the self-acclaimed kinesiologist and naturopathic doctor, who provided performance-enhancing drugs to athletes who participated at the Tokyo Olympics.

The 33-year-old has now been prohibited from all track and field events organised by World Athletics for the next decade.

“The Disciplinary Tribunal has banned Nigerian sprinter Blessing Okagbare for a total of 10 years, five years for the presence and use of multiple prohibited substances and five years for her refusal to co-operate with the AIU’s investigation into her case,” the statement read.

“The sole arbitrator adjudicating the case concluded that the athlete’s use of multiple prohibited substances as part of an organised doping regimen in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympic Games was egregious conduct that amounted to aggravating circumstances under the Rules thereby warranting an additional period of ineligibility on top of the standard four-year sanction.

“The sole arbitrator also recognised the AIU’s right to carry out investigations, including the imaging of electronic devices, and to impose sanctions when an athlete refuses to co-operate with an investigation and thereby frustrates the AIU’s ability to fulfil its mandate to protect the integrity of the sport of athletics.

“In this instance, the sole arbitrator concluded that the athlete’s refusal to cooperate had denied the AIU the opportunity to discover evidence of possible further rule violations by her as well possible violations of the rules by others, for which he imposed an additional sanction of five years.”

The statement added that the athlete has the right to appeal against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CaS) within 30 days.","The disciplinary tribunal of Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has handed Blessing Okagbare, the Nigerian sprinter, a 10-year ban for breaching multiple anti-doping rules.

Lagos shuts school over ‘brutal flogging’ of two-year old pupil,"The Lagos state government has shut down Unic Vilos Montessori school after a two-year-old pupil was allegedly brutalised by her teacher.

According to Channels TV, Folashade Adefisayo, the state’s commissioner for education, confirmed that the ministry has ordered the closure of the school.

Adefisayo disclosed that the affected school operates without approval. She also said the state government is on the verge to to clamp down on such centres of learning.

Last week Friday, a relative to the pupil had alleged that the yet-to-be-identified teacher “brutally flogged” the little girl “because she could not recite the English alphabet.”

The incident had attracted a wave of criticism on social media platforms, with several Nigerians condemning the teacher’s action.

It also raised concerns over the rising cases of teachers subjecting their pupils to hostile treatments.

In his reaction, Jubril Gawat, special assistant on new media to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, said the case is already under probe.

According to him, the issue is being investigated by a joint team consisting of the ministries of education, justice as well as youth and social development.

The incident occurred at about the same time when another teacher in Delta was accused of subjecting a 19-month-old pupil to “brutal flogging”.

The toddler was said to have died a few days after the beating.

17 feared dead as petrol tanker collides with vehicle on Lagos-Ibadan expressway,"At least 17 persons reportedly died in an accident involving a Mazda bus and a petrol tanker at Isara Bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway on Friday.

The collision was said to have resulted in a fire outbreak.

Ahmed Umar, the sector commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun, confirmed the incident to NAN.

Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases,"In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.

The growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021—its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.

Scams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called “rug pull”. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.

Cryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.

DeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.

DeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth—1,964%—for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens—all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.

While Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent “tokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges”.

Apart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.

In a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won’t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales—private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.

Despite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America’s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London’s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized £180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.

Earlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple’s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.

It’s all about seed rounds ￼,"Share this article:













Hello there,

The financial sector experienced a tremendous change last year, with massive growth in the use of digital financial services.

According to CB Insights’ ‘State of Fintech’ report, the third quarter of 2021 was the second highest on record for fintech financing, up 147 percent year on year, and 2022 appears to be more of the same.

It’s expected that fintechs will continue to drive financial inclusion, assisting in the development of a more accessible and sustainable digital economy for all, particularly in developing countries.

According to leading fintech enablement partner, Ukheshe Technologies, some of the biggest fintech trends poised to make an impact in the financial sector in 2022, include cross-border payments, mobile money, and buy now, pay later.

While this is most likely correct, given that African fintech company, Flutterwave, recently announced a $250 million Series D round, do you think any other industry will be able to compete with fintech companies in five years’ to a decade’s time in terms of financing? Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.

Well, today, I’ll be discussing:

Solving critical bankend freight industry challenges

Earnipay’s plans to reach 200,000 employees

Solving critical backend freight industry challenges















We all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.

For most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.

One of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.

Partech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.

Founded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.

According to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.

He also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company’s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.

Earnipay’s plans to reach 200,000 employees















Earnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.

The round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.

Nonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees’ financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.

Earnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.

What’s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.

By the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.

Nigeria’s shrinking economy records highest ‘growth’ under Buhari,"Nigeria’s economy may have grown by the most since 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari was first voted into office, but the size of the economy has shrunk since then and Nigerians are worse off.

The shrinking size of the economy means there is a smaller pie to share among Nigeria’s 200 million people, a painful squeeze for a country that is home to the world’s largest number of poor people.

That explains why many Nigerians can not relate with the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures put out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), according to Deji Obe, a Nigerian youth who has been without a job since what would be the first of two recessions in five years in 2016.

“The data gives the impression that things are finally getting better now that GDP growth has outpaced population growth for the first time since 2015,” Obe said. “But in reality, times are still very hard.”

The economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2021, the NBS said Thursday, marking the fastest growth rate in 7 years, helped by an improvement in the trade sector and low base effects. But the economy is valued at only $436.29 billion, 20 percent less than it was worth in 2014 ($546.67 billion). In that time the population has grown 13 percent.

“GDP numbers in isolation is incomplete when measuring the health of an economy, other factors like unemployment, poverty rate, inflation and human development index matter and Nigeria is nowhere near the desired level,” said Muda Yusuf , an economist and former head of trade advocacy group, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).

Nigeria is not only the world’s poverty capital, ahead of India which has five times its population, it’s unemployment rate at 33 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia and it has 7th highest inflation rate in Africa.

A cocktail of poor economic policies has made life in Nigeria tough, according to observers,

as tough as it has ever been in a long time.

Economists say the country’s performance in 2021, not significantly improved from the chaotic years since the recession in 2016, is made to look impressive by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when the economy shrank by the most in over two decades.

“The magnitude at which the economy contracted in 2020 has certainly had a big role to play in the 2021 growth numbers so it is no surprise,” said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and partner at consulting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC).

“The challenges the economy has faced since 2016 have not gone away, there is still a need for more fiscal and monetary reforms to take growth to sustainable levels,” Oyedele said.

While economists say the relatively high growth rate in 2021 is largely as a result of base effects, Harry Simon, who heads the government-owned NBS, could not agree more.

He said the impact of the low base effect could not be ruled out as it played a significant role in achieving the current figures and that it was not time to celebrate.

Trade sector records positive growth first time in 6yrs,"For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria’s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

According to the GDP report released Thursday by the NBS, the trade sector grew 8.62 percent.

Before now, it had contracted by 8.49 percent, 0.38 percent, 0.63 percent, 1.05 percent, and 0.24 percent in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Also, the growth rate in 2021 is the highest since 2012 (9.61%).

“The positive growth can be attributed to the low base effect, full reopening of the economy and the removal of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which has made activities in the trade sector to be much easier leading to its recovery,” Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, says.

Commenting in the same vein, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, notes that the recovery shows that businesses and economic activities have improved in the sector

“But despite the recovery, I am still bothered because the structural challenges such as high cost of foreign exchanges, weak demand, logistics issues, etc. still linger in the sector,” Adewale states.

The report also highlights that the country’s overall GDP grew by 3.98 percent (year-on-year) in Q4 ‘2021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 percent and -3.62 percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the pandemic.

“The fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 percent in 2021,” it states.

In terms of contribution to GDP, the trade sector contributed 15.66 percent, higher than the 15.46 percent it represented in the previous year, and higher than the 14.93 percent recorded in Q3 ‘2021.

Trade, which is the second biggest sector by output production, can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.

And due to this, the sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.

But in Africa’s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative territory since 2016 over myriad challenges like macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira’s depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.

Recently, a report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria’s real household consumption as a proportion of GDP rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post-pandemic for Nigeria’s consumer’s industry.

Additionally, a 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) reported that the country’s total retail sales rose to $108 billion after it had been trending south, falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015.

Analysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, said the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19.

Also, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says people have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones, noting, “E-commerce has also made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy.”","For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria’s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

LASAA launches e-Sticker verifier app for mobile advert registration,"The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the agency responsible for the regulation and control of all forms of signs and outdoor advertisement displays in Lagos State, has launched a dedicated e-Sticker Verification Application (app) for mobile avert registration by its clients.

The app which, according to the Agency, is available on Google and IOS store will help clients to authenticate the mobile advert Quick Response (QR) code issued to them by LASAA.

Speaking on the new app during the launch at the Agency’s head office recently, Managing Director of the Agency, Prince Adedamola Docemo explained that the LASAA e-Sticker Verification App is a reliable platform that allows LASAA field officers or law enforcement agencies to verify the authenticity of brand publication on automobiles in Lagos State.

“This innovation from the Lagos Signage Advertising Agency is a user-friendly interface that detects the brand registration information on stickers generated by LASAA to organisations and individuals respectively,” he said.

Docemo added that having registered brand information for automobiles on the LASAA sticker web platform and stickers generated, a field officer only needs to have the LASAA QR Code reader, which will decode the registration information of the branded publication.

Speaking further on the details of the application, LASAA’s Head of Corporate Communication & Strategy, Mr. Temitope Akande noted that information regarding the organisation or individual name, plate number (where applicable), brand type, vehicle type and branding type will be displayed seamlessly to verify the authenticity of the sticker.

“This platform has been developed to ensure branded automobiles have authorised stickers and to eradicate any occurrence of falsified brand information,” Akande said.

To use the application, clients should simply download and install the LASAA e-Sticker Verifier App from the Google store or App store.

Since the new mobile advert e-sticker was first launched and adopted in December 2021, the implication is that all old stickers became invalid, effective 1st of January 2022. The new sticker is aimed at stemming the activities of fraudsters and touts as well as middlemen who try to impersonate the staff of the Agency.","The Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), the agency responsible for the regulation and control of all forms of signs and outdoor advertisement displays in Lagos State, has launched a dedicated e-Sticker Verification Application (app) for mobile avert registration by its clients.

UNIAbuja VC Commends Federal Govt For Road Rehabilitation,"The vice-chancellor of the University of Abuja (UNIAbuja), Professor Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah has expressed appreciation to minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola and President Muhammadu Buhari for the rehabilitation of roads in the university.

Na’Allah made the appreciation during the formal handing over of 1.05 km of rehabilitated roads by the ministry under its intervention initiative in Abuja on Thursday.

He said what the government did is a gesture in the right direction, adding that what needs is huge because this is not up to what we need now but we are grateful.

“We have been trouble with the horrible road in the campus, if you go round, nobody needs not to tell you that roads are horrible, sometimes even dangerous, not just main campus, even Giri quarters and mini campus, these are the crisis we facing.”

“I have asked for a map of the entire main campus, very soon this map would be ready, that will specifically be described what is wrong, what we need, drainage system and we hope the ministry would come back to do more”.

In his remarks, the minister who was represented by Federal Controller of Works FCT, Engr. Yakubu Usman explained that Without quality education, a society can not develop, so it is quite significant.

“The quality of education will be impacted by the quality of infrastructure and the learning environment because education is the bedrock for functional and sustainable development and is the foundation of society.

“The gap of our infrastructure needs is steadily being bridged by a gradual process of repairs, renewal, and construction on major highways and it has reached the schools,” he said.

NNPC’s Energy Bank Proposal Receives African Oil Producers Backing,"African Oil producers have expressed support for the establishment of an energy bank to facilitate financing of major oil and gas projects in the continent.

The proposed energy bank is a decision being considered after Western nations threatened to halt overseas fossil fuel financing.

The decision has sparked alarm among Africa’s largest hydrocarbon exporters. But plans are afoot to create a new pan-African energy bank that can tackle waning oil and gas investment and drive-up production across the continent.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, and the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) are exploring the idea of establishing a so-called ‘African Energy Bank.’

ADVERTISEMENT

Afreximbank could not be reached for comment about the proposal, but the move has been cheered by industry lobby group, the African Energy Chamber, which says the value of such a bank ‘cannot be overstated.’

“Capital from foreign countries and companies will always be welcome, however regarding oil and gas, it isn’t reliable,” the group said in a statement.

“Therefore, through institutions such as the African energy bank, local oil and gas companies will be able to boost new and existing project developments; ensure reliable financing channels for oil and gas; and position the continent as a net exporter of hydrocarbons, all while creating critical capital opportunities for renewable energy projects,” it added.

The move comes about five months after minister of State for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, called for African governments to look into the initiative.

“If we insist on the exploration of our oil and gas reserves when the world is cutting down on investments in the sector, we must set a financial institution, an African Energy Bank, to develop the oil and gas sector,” Sylva said in September last year.

Speaking to Global Trade Review about the push to create an energy-focused bank on the continent, Adrian Lawrence, a partner in law firm Ashurst’s projects practice, says the initiative has been driven by the retreat of public and private finance from fossil fuels.

At the Cop26 climate summit in November, a number of countries pledged to end direct public financing for overseas fossil fuel development by the end of 2022, and to prioritise clean energy instead.

Already, many African countries rely heavily on oil and gas for their electricity needs. BP’s latest statistical review of world energy report shows the two fuels were responsible for roughly 48% of the continent’s total electricity generation in 2020.

“Large amounts of capital [will be needed] to implement these transition plans while supplying increasing amounts of power to their populations,” Lawrence said.

“There is thus a growing disconnect between the increasing financing needs of many African countries at a time when there is a narrowing range of institutions able or willing to fund even the most ‘bankable’ of [oil and gas] projects,” he added.

As the industry awaits the release of further details on the new energy bank, questions inevitably arise about how such an institution would find the necessary capital, with Africa’s major petroleum producers all suffering from a chronic lack of investment in recent years.","African Oil producers have expressed support for the establishment of an energy bank to facilitate financing of major oil and gas projects in the continent.

"Aregbesola, CSOs Trade Tackles Over Violence In Osun","Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State yesterday trade blame over the recent clash between the minister’s camp and that of the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, which attracted the attention of security agencies.

Reacting to the feud between the Osun State governor and the minister on the attendant spate of violence in the state, the coalition of CSO’O cast the first stone when it called on President Muhammadu Buhari to call the former governor of the state to order.

Addressing journalists in Abuja yesterday, the coalition comprising The Osun Masterminds, Transparency and Accountability Group (TAG), Centre for Sustainable Dialogue (CSD), Oodua Youth Parliament (OYP), Osun Young Professionals (OYP), and Nigerians for Good Governance (NGG), alleged that the former Osun State governor and Interior Minister has been using security agencies under his control to threaten peace in the South-West state by instigating violence.

Dr Wasiu Oyedokun Alli, who spoke on behalf of the coalition said, “While superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.

“We have seen recently how men of the NSCDC, the NIS and the NCS sporadically shot in the air to terrify citizens of the State in Osogbo and other towns within the State. We refer to the official release of the Osun State Police Command, concerning the actions of men of the NSCDC, NIS and NCS.”

The Coalition urged President Buhari to sack Aregbesola from his cabinet ahead of July 16 governorship election in the state, accusing him of “shows of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the state, denigration of elder statesmen.

But firing back at the CSOs, Aregbesola asked Nigerians to disregard the CSOs, saying they are “the rent-a-crowd pseudo-NGOs.”

Speaking through his media assistant, Sola Fasure, the minister insisted that he was the victim rather than the aggressor in the violence perpetrated so far in the state.

He said, “It is on record that on Monday whilst returning from a well-attended political sensitisation rally in Ilesa, known hoodlums attacked the convoy of the Minister as he approached the popular Old Garage junction in Osogbo.

“His convoy comprising of well-trained officers of the Department of State Security, The Nigeria Police Force (charged with protecting the minister) and other security personnel drawn from the Paramilitary services, professionally responded to the daring attackers who were armed with diverse sophisticated weapons.

“Having failed to achieve their mission of killing the minister on Monday, the sponsors of the evil plot have now resorted to smearing his name, hoping to achieve through the back door, what they can’t get fairly on the field.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the minister is aware of his constitutional role as a member of the governing cabinet, a leading light of the ruling All Progressives Congress and as the Minister of Interior, charged with providing security for the nation.”

“However, the Minister, just like other Nigerians, also has the democratic right of association as enshrined in our constitution. This, in our opinion, doesn’t deserve the murder of any Nigerian, talk-less of a serving minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”","Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and a coalition of civil society organisations in Osun State yesterday trade blame over the recent clash between the minister’s camp and that of the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, which attracted the attention of security agencies.

WHO reports first wild polio outbreak in Malawi,"In Africa, the landlocked country of Malawi has reported the first wild polio outbreak on the continent in several years.

The wild type 1 poliovirus was discovered in a child in the city of Lilongwe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Friday.

Laboratory tests had shown that it had apparently been brought in from Pakistan, it said.

“As long as wild polio exists anywhere in the world all countries remain at risk of importation of the virus,” said WHO regional director Matshidiso Moeti.

The organisation will support local health authorities in the south-east African country to ensure that the case remains isolated and does not spread, she said.

Polio is a contagious infectious disease and can cause paralysis and death.

Except for Afghanistan and Pakistan, all countries in the world had beaten the wild polioviruses.

2023: Tambuwal Is PDP’s Best Bet For Presidency — GNC,"The Generation Next Collective, a group of youth and women’s organizations, has described Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as the finest candidate the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, can field for the 2023 presidential election.

As a result, the committee urged the party’s leadership to act quickly and be more explicit about the path the party plans to take in selecting its presidential candidate for the 2023 race.

“One person, in our estimation, that ticks the right boxes, is the Governor of Sokoto State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A lawyer, lawmaker, public administrator and chief executive of a state in the past seven years, it is our view and those of many, that the PDP would not be making a mistake with his choice and wealth of experience,” the group said.

GNC’s position was contained in a statement released by its co- conveners, Barrister Ruth Edehemon and Malam Rufai Abdulahi, in Abuja yesterday. It read:

“Across the nation, there is a general consensus, that 2023 election, should as a matter of importance, answer some nagging questions, among which are equity, justice and inclusion, the key tripod that ensure democratic balance.

“And PDP as a democratic party, should not shy away from this conversation that is rooted in fairness and truth. Beyond sentiments, the South and North are deserving of fair play and inclusion, a twin democratic feature that have been unwittingly starved by the government in power and would require an urgent restoration for the common good and unity of our dear nation.

“It is expedient that the PDP addresses the lingering ambiguity over which zone the presidential candidate should come from; and follow it up by building an honest purpose-driven, robust consensus, as may be allowed by law, around a suitable aspirant that possesses not only the leadership skill to unite the nation, but also be a veritable linkage between the older and the current generations; such that the sublimity of wisdom and restraint of leadership would find a meeting point with the treasure trove of the energy, creativity and ingenuity of the youth demography.

” Incontrovertible records show that the PDP as a party has managed the affairs of the nation at the presidency level for 16 years. And it’s a fact that the Southern part of the nation had held sway for over 14 years of the 16, through former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo 8 years (1999 -2007) and Goodluck Jonathan, 6 years (2010 – 2015). While the North had only ruled for a little over two years under the late former President Umaru Yar’Adua, who unfortunately died in office.

“So, we strongly believe that rather than this disturbing silence that is eliciting enflamed passion and seeming confusion, over the zone that should be supported for presidency in 2023 in the PDP, the party should be bold to speak up by putting this record into consideration, bring its leaders from both the North and South on a round table, address their deferent sentiments, do necessary in-house negotiations and present a formidable, united front that would give the party a meaningful chance in the challenge ahead.”

On the aspirant from the North with requisite leadership and managerial experience, personality and public appeal, that could benefit from the consensus approach, the GNC said: “With no prejudice to other prominent aspirants from the zone in PDP, the party should build consensus around someone with less controversy or negative public sentiments, with an unquestionable vigour for the demanding job of a president, essentially now that public scrutiny is rising over age and other physical variables of potential candidates, ahead of the general election.

“One person, in our estimation, that ticks the right boxes, is the Governor of Sokoto State, and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. A lawyer, lawmaker, public administrator and chief executive of a state in the past seven years, it is our view and those of many, that the PDP would not be making a mistake with his choice and wealth of experience.

“Tambuwal’s privileged interactions with different interests, sectors and segments in and out of the Nigerian society, would enrich the contest and brighten the chances of the PDP, should it act fast and rally its faithful, contacts and resources around him.

"BREAKING: Buhari Government To Tax Goods, Services Brought In By Companies Without Nigerian Offices","The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has announced that it will begin taxing non-resident corporations who bring products or services into Nigeria.

The agency stated in a statement signed by Johannes Oluwatobi Wojuola, its Special Assistant to the Executive Chairman (Media & Communication), that it would use the Finance Act 2021’s instrumentality to raise revenue for Nigeria by collaborating with taxpayers and other stakeholders.

Muhammad Nami, the FIRS’ Executive Chairman, was quoted as saying this on Thursday while giving the keynote talk at KPMG’s Webinar on Nigeria’s 2022 Budget and the Finance Act 2021.

Nma said, “In the past, situations abound where certain goods or services streamed into Nigeria by non-resident companies, especially to consumers (B2Cs), were not subject to VAT. This raised the issue of equity, as goods and services offered by domestic companies are subject to VAT.

“With the amendment of Section 10 of the VAT Act and our publication of the ‘Guidelines on Simplified VAT Compliance Regime for Non-Resident Suppliers’, there is now a mechanism for applying VAT on such goods or services, affording the same tax treatment to both local and foreign supplies.



“Similarly, companies deriving income from Nigeria without physical presence can now be assessed, like other companies with physical presence, on fair and reasonable percentage of their turnover in line with Section 30 of CITA.”



On the automation of tax processes, the FIRS Executive Chairman noted that “with the amendment of Section 25 of the FIRS Establishment Act, the Service can now deploy either proprietary or third-party developed technologies for tax administration.”

“Those that may still stand in the way of achieving this objective will now be liable to a daily penalty of N25,000,” it added.

“With the extension of secrecy and confidentiality requirements to other persons, like service providers, vendors and consultants of the Service, the fear of taxpayers is further allayed on the secrecy and confidentiality of their commercial and other information,” it said.



Muhammad Nami further noted that with the amendment to Section 68 of the FIRS Establishment Act by the Finance Act, complaints from taxpayers about multiple agencies of government demanding payment of tax from them has been addressed.



He said, “This unfortunate situation is not in line with the national tax policy thrust and was causing confusion for our taxpayers and increasing their cost of compliance.

“However, the amendment to section 68 of the FIRS Act by the Finance Act 2021 has made it clear that FIRS is the only agency responsible for tax assessment, collection and enforcement.

"Breaking: Another fuel scarcity averted as NNPC, NUPENG, others reach truce","The Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) have suspended their planned strike after an intervention by the NNPC Ltd.

The parties also pledged collaboration on ensuring nationwide availability of petroleum products.

The suspension notice was made known in a communique following a critical stakeholders engagement between the NNPC Ltd., the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), PTD, NARTO, and NUPENG on Thursday, in Abuja.

The communique was jointly signed by Malam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Otunba Salmon Oladiti, National Chairman PTD , Mr Yusuf Otthman, NARTO President Comrade Williams Akporeha, NUPENG President and Abiodun Adeniji, Executive Director, Finance and Admin, NMDPRA.

NUPENG and PTD had planned to embark on strike following allegations that officials of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing were diverting the fund provided by NNPC Limited for the rehabilitation of 21 critical highways.

On Road Rehabilitation, the communique said NNPC provided updates on the current status of the road construction and rehabilitation projects under the road infrastructure tax credit scheme.

It said the NNPC assured the stakeholders that the funding earmarked for the 21 critical roads would be applied for the intended purpose only.

“To allay the fears of the stakeholders, NNPC and all parties commit to working together in the monitoring of the road projects,” it stated..

On review of freight rate for transporters, the communique noted that the stakeholders requested for completion of the ongoing discussion on the review of the freight rates to cover operational costs.

It noted that the stakeholders highlighted the precarious situation that truck owners faced in the light of current economic realities.

It further noted that the NMDPRA informed the meeting that a committee was constituted to review the rates which included PTD, NARTO and NUPENG in addition to other stakeholders.

It stated that all parties agreed to work expeditiously towards concluding the review of the freight rate and make recommendations to the Government.

According to the communique, the Authority is to advise on definite close-out date during the week of Feb. 21.

“The parties also agreed to foster collaboration on ensuring nationwide availability of petroleum products.

"Nigeria, Five Other African Countries To Begin Production Of Covid Vaccines – WHO","Nigeria and five other African countries have been chosen to begin production of COVID-19 vaccines, with the continent having had limited access to jabs.

“Today I’m delighted to announce the first six African countries that will receive technology from the hub to produce their own mRNA vaccines: Egypt, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, and Tunisia,” Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday.

According to the WHO, they were selected as the first recipients of technology from the organisation’s global mRNA vaccine hub, in a push to ensure the African continent can make its own jabs to fight COVID and other diseases.

“I was honoured to visit the Hub last week. And it’s already producing results, with Afrigen’s announcement that it has produced its own mRNA vaccine, based on publicly-available information about the composition of an existing vaccine,” Ghebreyesus said.

“We expect clinical trials to start in the 4th quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024. We expect the benefits of this initiative will extend far beyond #COVID19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria and tuberculosis”.

“WHO will work with the companies and the government in each country to develop a roadmap for training and production, based on their needs and capacities.

“Thank you all, and we look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success, for the healthier, safer and fairer Africa”.

According to the WHO boss, no other event like the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous.

He, therefore, stressed that the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need.

Tedros has continually called for equitable access to vaccines in order to beat the pandemic, and rails against the way wealthy nations have hogged doses, leaving Africa lagging behind other continents in the global vaccination effort.

A ceremony marking the mRNA tech transfer announcement was held Friday in Brussels at the summit between the European Union and the African Union.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said: “We have been talking a lot about producing mRNA vaccines in Africa. But this goes even beyond. This is mRNA technology designed in Africa, led by Africa and owned by Africa.”

Self-reliance

Currently, only one per cent of the vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent of some 1.3 billion people.

The WHO set up a global mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines.

The global hub’s role is to ensure that manufacturers in those nations have the know-how to make mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.

As used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, mRNA technology provokes an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells.

Primarily set up to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the global hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other vaccines and products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.

The scheme’s ultimate goal is to spread capacity for national and regional production to all health technologies.

‘Mutual Respect’

The WHO said it would work with the first six countries chosen to develop a roadmap of training and support so they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.

Training will begin in March.

The South African hub is already producing mRNA vaccines at laboratory scale and is currently scaling up towards commercial scale.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday’s announcement “means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent”.

French President Emmanuel Macron said supporting African health sovereignty was one of the key goals of starting up local production, “to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time”.

More than 10.4 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, with nearly 62 percent of the global population having received at least one shot.

However, just 11.3 per cent of Africans had been fully immunised by the start of February.

In Nigeria, many are yet to be vaccinated despite efforts by authorities to make citizens get the jab.

On Thursday, the country recorded 45 new cases of the virus, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 254,182.

230,530 cases are, however, said to have recovered, while 3,141 deaths have been recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.

The 45 new cases were reported from eight states – Lagos (18), Cross River (7), FCT (7), Oyo (5), Kano (3), Nasarawa (3), Ekiti (1) and Rivers (1).

Across the world, the vaccine continues to rage on.

Here are some of the latest developments on the impact of the virus:

Japan eases strict border bar

Japan will ease its strict virus border rules to allow students and businesspeople into the country from March, but tourists will still be barred.

Portugal to lift most Covid rules

Portugal will no longer require people to present a health pass when going to restaurants and hotels, the government says, without providing a fixed date. Proof of vaccination is still necessary to enter the country.

Swiss president tests positive

On the day Switzerland lifts almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions, the government announces President Ignazio Cassis has tested positive.

Covid-19 pill

A South Africa regulator says it has approved the use of Merck’s Covid-19 pill for high-risk adults.

Canada Police Set to End Seige of Protesters Fighting Covid Measures,"Canadian police are poised to clear out on Friday hundreds of truck drivers from Ottawa who have staged a three-week-long protest against pandemic restrictions that has crippled the capital and prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assume emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years.

The drivers, joined by thousands of demonstrators and some 400 vehicles, turned the streets around Parliament into a noisy party zone since first arriving on Jan. 28, in what has become one of the worst crises to hit Trudeau since he took power in 2015. Police made a handful of arrests Thursday evening, including of Chris Barber, one of the main fundraisers and organizers, after authorities said action was imminent. Barber went without resistance after police told him he was being arrested for mischief. “We absolutely are committed to end this unlawful demonstration. We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,” interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday. Police will set up a perimeter with 100 checkpoints around downtown to stop people without legitimate reason from entering, he said.

“This weekend will look very different than the past three weekends,” he added. Previous chief Peter Sloly quit this week amid residents’ fury about what they saw as police inaction. The truckers’ protests started against vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, a measure in place in the United States, too. But slowly it spread across Canada and morphed into an anti-government movement. Protesters blocked several land crossings with the United States, including the busiest, the Ambassador Bridge which connects to Detroit, for six days, hurting both economies.

Calling the blockades a threat to democracy, Trudeau invoked emergency measures on Monday giving his government temporary powers to end the unrest. Government officials said they were worried about extremists causing violence.

“End the mandates, give us our rights and this is over,” said Chris Dacey on Thursday. “We’ll all go back to our families.” The border blockades turned the pressure on Trudeau to act swiftly, and U.S. President Joe Biden asked him to use federal powers. Many protesters on Parliament Hill said they would not leave until their demands were met. “The illegal blockades and occupations have to stop and the borders have to remain open,” Trudeau told legislators on Thursday as Parliament started debate on the Emergencies Act, which needs to be passed within seven days of an announcement.

But the official opposition Conservative Party says there was no need for the Emergencies Act, especially since the border blockades are over. Conservative Parliamentarian Jeremy Patzer told the House of Commons on Thursday that people around the world were alarmed to see Trudeau “come down on peaceful protesters with a sledgehammer.”","We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,” interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday.

Rebels Accuse Ukraine of Shelling as Russian Media Reports Tank Withdrawals,"Pro-Russia rebels in Ukraine accused government forces of shelling a village on Friday while Russian media reported more infantry and tank units were returning to their bases in contrast to Western fears of an imminent Russian invasion.

Kyiv and the rebels blamed each other for escalating tension after artillery and mortar attacks on Thursday, prompting fears that Russia, which has massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, could get involved.

The Kremlin said on Thursday it was “deeply concerned” with the flare-up in Ukraine and was watching the situation closely. The United States said Russia was looking for a pretext for war.

"Mass Youth Migration to Europe Draining Africa’s Talent Pool, Buhari Laments","Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has lamented the mass migration of African youth to Europe, saying it drains the continent’s talent pool, while provoking political crises in Europe.

The president stated this in an article he penned to mark the participation of Nigeria at the ongoing 6th EU-AFRICA summit in Brussels, Belgium.

In the article published in Politico, an online/offline magazine which is the most influential publication for the EU/ in Brussels, Buhari noted that despite its best efforts, Europe would not find a sustainable remedy to this problem by further reinforcing its Fortress Europe approach.

According to him, instead, more opportunities must be created for Africans at home, providing alternatives to the decision to take a life-threatening boat journey in order to seek them elsewhere.

He advised that economic relationship between the two continents must be recalibrated to focus on job creation.

The president said, “By 2050, Africa’s population of 1.3 billion was set to double, making up a quarter of the world’s total. My country, Nigeria, is set to double its population to 400 million by then, surpassing the United States to become the third largest nation in the world.

“This means a huge youthful market right on Europe’s doorstep and — with increased trade a growing middle class with money to spend. However, despite burgeoning possibility, irregular northward migration from my continent drains Africa’s talent pool, while provoking political crises in the EU.

“When it comes to the relationship between the European Union and Africa, unfair arrangements have long been skated over for lack of alternatives.

“Increasingly unsustainable, these one-sided deals have provoked calls from both sides of the Mediterranean for a partnership of equals.

“At the EU-Africa Summit, leaders from across my continent will gather with their European counterparts to transform such rhetoric into substance. The EU is currently Africa’s largest trading partner, and Africa is the fastest growing continent on earth. While each presents the other with great opportunities, as partners, we also share a host of problems.

“Today, the EU-Africa relationship must be shifted toward a new economic arrangement in order to address them. The relationship between the EU and Africa must be rebalanced to power job creation. Unfortunately, today’s arrangements do just the opposite.

“Where some claim preferential trade policies with the EU lend a helping hand to Africa, the real picture is far more complicated. The Everything but Arms scheme grants 32 African countries tariff-free access to Europe’s protected markets. In addition to the fact that this excludes many of the continent’s 54 nations, there remain barriers to Europe’s markets even for countries that qualify.

“For example, though agricultural subsidies to EU farmers may not be the same as external tariffs, their effects are identical: They make Africa’s exports uncompetitive. More than €50 billion is ploughed into keeping European food produce cheap. “With its main export market distorted against them, African countries are deprived of foreign exchange, and investment in agriculture is stifled.

“Moving forward, it is clear what a new economic deal between our unions should entail: For Africa, it must offer a chance for a fundamentally new economic deal. For Europe, it must provide the chance to rid itself of a trade policy that quashes job-creation in Africa and hinders efforts to stem economic migration to Europe. The way forward is clear, the deal just needs to be struck.”

"Nigeria’s Economy Records 3.4% GDP Growth, Highest Since 2014","RelatedStories No Content Available

Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.40 per cent in 2021, the highest since 2014, when the economy grew by 6.22 per cent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) disclosed on Thursday.

According to the National GDP Q4 report released by the NBS, the expansion in economic activities was majorly driven by the non-oil sector.

The report also revealed that the country’s GDP grew by 3.98 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year (Q4 2021), lower than the 4.03 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter.

The performance indicated a sustained positive growth for five consecutive quarters since the recession witnessed in 2020, when output contracted by 6.10 per cent and 3.62 per cent respectively in the Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to report by the statistical agency, the economy was largely driven by the non-oil sector, which accounted for 94.81 per cent of GDP while the oil sector contributed 5.19 per cent to growth.

The Q4 growth indicated a steady economic recovery, accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 per cent in 2021. It noted that growth rate under the review period was higher than the 0.11 per cent recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87 percentage points and lower than 4.03 per cent recorded in Q3 by 0.05 percentage points.

The NBS, nevertheless, stated that quarter-on-quarter, real GDP grew at 9.63 per cent in Q4, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter.

The average daily oil production stood at 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd), lower than the 1.57mbpd in Q3 and 1.56 mbpd in Q4 2020.

Oil growth rate stood at -8.06 per cent in real terms in Q4 and annual growth rate of -8.30 per cent in 2021. On an annual basis, oil contributed 7.24 per cent compared to 8.16 per cent in 2020.

The non-oil sector, which excluded crude petroleum and natural gas activities, recorded a growth of 4.73 per cent in real terms, an improvement from the 1.69 per cent reported in Q4 2020.

The sector recorded an annual growth of 4.44 per cent compared to -1.25 per cent in 2020.

However, annual contribution of the non-oil sector increased to 92.76 per cent from 91.84 per cent in 2020.

The services sector contributed 55.11 per cent to the total growth while agriculture contributed 26.84 per cent to overall GDP in real terms in Q4, lower than 29.94 per cent in the preceding quarter and 26.95 per cent in Q4 2020.

The manufacturing sector contributed 8.46 per cent, lower than the 8.60 per cent lower than 8.96 per cent in Q3 and 8.98 per cent in Q4 2020.

In nominal terms, aggregate GDP stood at N49.28 trillion in Q4, higher than the N43.56 trillion in Q4 2020, and indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.11 per cent.

Nominal GDP in the preceding quarter of Q3 2021 stood at N45.11 trillion, while annual nominal value in 2021 was N173.53 trillion as compared to N152.32 trillion in 2020, indicating a growth rate of 13.92 per cent.

In terms of real GDP which shows the volume of economic activities, the sum of N20.33 trillion was recorded in Q4, higher than N18.54 trillion in the preceding quarter and also by N778.91 billion compared to N19.55 trillion recorded in Q4 2020.

The nominal GDP growth rate in Q4 was higher relative to 10.07 per cent growth recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020 but lower compared to 15.41 per cent growth recorded in the preceding quarter.

However, in 2021 annual nominal growth stood at 13.92 per cent.

According to the NBS, “The improvement being seen in the output growth in the last five quarters depicts a steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy.

“Globally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic. Thus, economic recovery is a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors.

“However, in Nigeria, the prospects of consolidating the recovery are glaring considering the improved economic performance over these periods of time.”
